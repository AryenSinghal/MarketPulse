Personal loan FAQs

What are the benefits of refinancing debt?

If you carry a balance on a credit card (or multiple cards) with a high APR, you might want to consider debt refinancing. Simply put, you take out a new loan to pay off old debt, then pay back the new debt according to agreed-upon terms. It makes sense to refinance if you can't afford your current bill payments and need to find a lower monthly plan, or if your credit score is good enough to qualify you for a lower APR, which makes paying off the debt cheaper. For example, say you have a $10,000 balance on your credit card that charges interest at a rate of 24.99% APR. Assuming you can afford to make $400 monthly payments, it would take about three years to pay your balance off entirely. You'll also pay about $4,000 in interest, according to Experian's debt payoff calculator. On the other hand, transferring that debt to a personal loan with a 9% APR, can save you more than $3,000. Experian's calculator estimates with the same monthly payment ($400) and the lower APR, you can pay off the balance in 22 months and only pay $875 in interest charges overall. When you apply for a personal loan, you should consider the APR and the loan's term, or the length of time it will take you to pay it off. Make sure the monthly loan repayment amount fits into your budget, so you're able to comfortably pay off the loan and get your debt under control.

Can debt refinancing hurt your credit score?

At its best, debt refinancing can boost your credit score by making your monthly payments more affordable and motivating you to pay off your balances. But they aren't entirely risk-free. Personal loan applications require a credit check, so you'll want to make sure you know your credit score before you apply. There's no direct penalty for getting denied a loan, but having too many applications on your credit record could be a red flag to future lenders. For debt refinancing to work, you have to ""plan your work and work your plan,"" so to speak. It helps to be honest about your money habits and the overall state of your personal finances before taking on any loan. Personal loans deliver cash directly to your bank account, making it easy to stay in debt if you're not careful. If you have concerns, opt for a loan that pays your creditors directly so that there's no opportunity for you to overspend. And before you agree to a new loan, make sure you have room in your budget to pay it back on time and in full according to the terms. A late payment on your personal loan can hurt your credit score just like if you miss a credit card bill.

What is a good interest rate on a personal loan?

Most personal loans come with fixed-rate APRs, so your monthly payment stays the same for the loan's lifetime. In a few cases, you can take out a variable-rate personal loan. If you go that route, make sure you're comfortable with your monthly payments changing if rates go up or down. Personal loan APRs average 9.65%, according to the Fed's most recent data. Meanwhile, the average credit card interest rate is around 16.28%. When considering whether to invest or pay off debt, consider that the average rate of return in the stock market tends to be above 5% when adjusted for inflation. So if you can find a personal loan with interest rates would be below 5%, you can slowly pay off your debt while also investing because you know your investments could still earn more than you're paying in interest. However, it's not always easy to qualify for personal loans with interest rates lower than 5% APR. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.

How do personal loans work?

Once you're approved for a personal loan, the cash is usually delivered directly to your checking account. However, if you opt for a debt consolidation/refinancing loan, you can sometimes have your lender pay your credit card accounts directly. Any extra cash leftover will be deposited into your bank account or returned to the lender. Most loan terms range anywhere from six months to seven years. The longer the term, the lower your monthly payments will be, but they usually also have higher interest rates. It's best to elect for the shortest term you can afford. When deciding on a loan term, consider how much you will end up paying in interest overall. Your monthly loan bill will include your installment payment plus interest charges. If you think you may want to pay off the loan earlier than planned, be sure to check if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Sometimes lenders charge a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker, since they are losing out on that prospective interest. The fee could be a flat rate, a percentage of your loan amount or the rest of the interest you would have owed them. Once you receive the money from your loan, you have to pay back the lender in monthly installments, usually starting within 30 days. When your personal loan is paid off, the credit line is closed and you no longer have access to it.

How is my personal loan rate decided?

As you shop for a low-interest loan or credit card, remember that banks are looking for reliable borrowers who make timely payments. Financial institutions will look at your credit score, income, payment history and, in some cases, cash reserves when deciding what APR to give you. To get approved for any kind of credit product (credit card, loan, mortgage, etc.), you'll first submit an application and agree to let the lender pull your credit report. This helps lenders understand how much debt you owe, what your current monthly payments are and how much additional debt you have the capacity to take on. Once you submit your application, you may be approved for a variety of loan options. Each will have a different length of time to pay the loan back (your term) and a different interest rate. Your interest rate will be decided based on your credit score, credit history and income, as well as other factors like the loan's size and term. Generally, loans with longer terms have higher interest rates than loans you bay back over a shorter period of time.

Our methodology

To determine which personal loans are the best for refinancing debt, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. *Your LightStream loan terms, including APR, may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term length, and your credit profile. Excellent credit is required to qualify for lowest rates. Rate is quoted with AutoPay discount. AutoPay discount is only available prior to loan funding. Rates without AutoPay are 0.50% points higher. Subject to credit approval. Conditions and limitations apply. Advertised rates and terms are subject to change without notice. Payment example: Monthly payments for a $10,000 loan at 7.99% APR with a term of three years would result in 36 monthly payments of $313.32.

What is considered a quick loan?

Loans that can be disbursed as soon as the same business day as approval (or even one business day later) are typically considered quick loans. Most lenders can provide funding in a few days, usually 3–5 business days after approval. However, some lenders who disburse funds through a mailed check can take longer to get you the loan proceeds — usually closer to a week. That's why a quick loan is the ideal solution for someone who wants (or needs) their money ASAP.

What are the pros and cons of quick personal loans?

Pros No collateral required: Personal loans generally don't require you to secure the loan with an asset. This is good news since you won't be at risk of losing something valuable, like your car, if you default on the loan. However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit.

However, there will still be implications to your credit score if you fail to repay your loan, as with any other form of credit. Lower interest rates: Personal loans generally carry lower interest rates compared to credit cards (unless you have a credit card with a 0% intro APR). This makes them a more affordable alternative. Just keep in mind that applying with a higher credit score makes you eligible for.

Lump sum disbursement: Borrowers receive their funding in the form of a lump sum deposited into their bank account. This provides ultimate flexibility in when and how you use the funds.

Cons Potentially numerous fees: Unlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees.

Unlike credit cards, personal loans often come with origination fees, application fees and sometimes even prepayment penalties. These fees can add onto the cost of borrowing a personal loan. Though, it is possible to find lenders that don't charge these fees. Higher monthly payments: For the most part, credit cards require a low minimum monthly payment (though, experts advise paying off your balance in full each month). With personal loans, though, your monthly payment is often higher than that of credit cards even if you have a long loan term. Granted, you're able to borrow higher amounts with a personal loan than you would with a credit card.

How do you apply for a quick loan?

First, you should compare different quick loans. Many lenders will let you check (for free) on their websites what interest rate you'll likely receive with them. This lets you eliminate the high-rate options and hone in on your preferred lender. Once you've picked your lender, you then apply for a loan. This will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit history, which lowers your score a little, so don't apply for more than one loan if you can help it. The application usually requires you to submit personal information like your address, social security number and the loan purpose. The best way to receive a loan quickly is to ensure all information is accurate and complete. Errors or failure to submit complete information could delay the approval process.

What are the credit requirements for a quick loan?

Credit requirements depend on the lender. Most lenders want to see good-to-excellent credit, but a handful of lenders cater to borrowers with fair or poor credit. Be sure to double-check with the lender before applying.

FAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.

Our methodology

To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with no origination or signup fees, fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick funding, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate per the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Types of mortgages

Here are some of the most common types of mortgages you can apply for. Conventional mortgage The most common type of home loan, a conventional mortgage is offered by a private lender, such as a bank or credit union. Conventional loans typically require a down payment between 5% and 20%. FHA loan An FHA loan is still issued by a private lender but it's backed by the Federal Housing Administration. It usually requires a smaller down payment, typically 3.5% with a credit score of 580 or 10% with a score of 500. VA loan A VA loan is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It may be issued by a partner bank or credit union or by the VA directly. These loans usually don't require a down payment but you must be an active service member, a veteran or a surviving spouse to be approved. USDA loan A USDA loan is backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and doesn't require a down payment or mortgage insurance. Applicants must meet income requirements, however, and the funds must be used to buy a home in a qualifying rural or suburban area. Jumbo loan A jumbo loan exceeds the limits on mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The conforming loan limit in 2024 is $766,550 in most parts of the U.S., although some high-price areas have limits up to $1,149,825.

Origination fee FAQs What is an origination fee? An origination fee is charged by a mortgage lender to cover the cost of processing your loan. Origination fees may be lumped in with other upfront costs or waived in exchange for a higher interest rate or some other adjustment to your loan. How much are origination fees? Origination fees are commonly between 0.5% and 1% of your total loan amount. Some lenders charge a fixed amount, regardless of the size of the mortgage. What are lender fees? ""Lender fees"" are an umbrella term referring to the various charges associated with processing, approving and funding your loan. These are essentially a subset of closing costs and can include an origination fee, processing fee, underwriting fee and more.

How do credit repair services work?,"If you’re struggling with bad credit, there's a chance it's not your fault: A Consumer Reports study found that almost half (44%) of people who reviewed their credit reports found mistakes, with a significant proportion of those errors potentially damaging to their credit score. Credit repair companies can contact the three main credit bureaus on your behalf to remove inaccurate or outdated negative information from your credit reports. They can also work with banks, debt collectors and other financial institutions. While much of this is work you can do on your own for free, it can be daunting and time-consuming. For users of credit repair companies, having a professional go to bat for you is worth the expense —especially when the result is a major increase in your credit score.

What do credit repair companies do?

Credit repair services can't remove legitimate and current information from your credit history, like unpaid balances, defaulted loans or bankruptcies. They work to ensure the information in your credit report is accurate. According to Consumer Reports, credit report errors can include: Accounts or loans that have been paid off but appear unpaid,

Individual loans listed multiple times

Debts that are incorrectly reported in collections.

Misspelled names, wrong addresses or incorrect birth dates

Mixed files: Information from someone with a similar name or Social Security number

Fraudulent accounts are listed as a result of identity theft. Before signing up for any credit repair service, make sure they follow the Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA), which regulates how these companies can operate. Consumers have three business days to cancel a contract with a credit repair company without charge. In addition, companies can’t guarantee they can remove something from your credit report and they can't advise you to make false or misleading statements or change your identity to prevent the credit bureaus from associating information with you.

Offers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability. Credit Saint Credit Restoration Highlights Credit Saint offers three packages for credit repair services and a 90-day money-back guarantee for services. It has received an A rating and is accredited by the Better Business Bureau. LEARN MORE The Credit People Credit Report Repair Highlights The Credit People's Credit Report Repair service is relatively affordable compared to other programs in the space. Even the most basic package (the standard package) includes unlimited challenges to all three credit bureaus. Upgrading to the premium package includes escalated disputes and monthly credit score reports and score refreshes. LEARN MORE

What's included in my credit report?

There may be variations from one bureau to another, but a credit report will typically contain information about your financial accounts — including the date opened, credit limit or loan amount, balance, monthly payments and payment pattern during the past several years. Any bankruptcies or negative judgments will also be noted, as will any statements of dispute you may have filed.



Your name, current and previous addresses, phone number, Social Security number, date of birth, and current and previous employers. You can also find the names of anyone who has obtained a copy of your credit report.



Credit bureaus do not gather data about race, religion, medical history, sexual orientation, political affiliation, criminal record or any other information that is unrelated to credit.

Credit repair FAQs What is credit repair? Credit repair is the process of correcting inaccurate or dated information on your credit report. Credit repair companies cannot remove accurate and current information. How long does credit repair take? It can take several months to a year for an error to be removed from your report, depending on the issue, how many credit bureaus the error appears in and if they are disputing your request. How much does credit repair cost? Credit repair services are typically set up as monthly subscriptions, with fees ranging from $50 to $100 depending on the service offered. Many companies have add-on benefits available through different tiered plans. There may also be a one-time setup charge, which can range from $70 to $200. Can I repair my credit myself? Yes, you can tidy up your credit history on your own. Request credit reports from the main three credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — and verify that the information is accurate. Check for discrepancies with your name, address and other personal info, as well as with account details (like balances, credit limit and payment history) and anything sent to a collection agency.



If you find any errors on your credit report, start a dispute as soon as possible.

How does tax software for small businesses work?

S-Corporations, C-Corporations, LLCs, partnerships and other businesses have specific tax forms they use to report their income and deductions for the year. S-Corps file Form 1120-S, for example, while C-Corps use Form 1120 and partnerships use Form 1065. The best tax software works with accounting software to track your expenses, income, profits and losses throughout the year, so there's less to do by Tax Day. It should also point you toward industry-specific deductions that will enable you to cut down your tax liability. The average cost of working with a tax professional is about $600, compared to $50 to $200 for tax-prep software for businesses.



That's significant savings — and many online programs provide access to tax pros for a moderate fee, so you can have the best of both options.

Small business tax software FAQs Can I use tax software to track my estimated quarterly taxes? All of our choices for small business tax software include tools for year-round planning, including quarterly tax estimates, expense tracking and reminders of quarterly due dates. How do you make estimated tax payments? You can make estimated tax payments through some online tax software, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or by mailing in a completed 1040-ES form with your payment. If you mail in your payment, it must be postmarked by the due date to avoid penalties. How much should I set aside for taxes for my business? Your tax bill for the year will depend on many unique factors, but experts suggest small business owners set aside at least 25% of their net profits for taxes. Some will advise saving as much as 30% or 40%.

How to file your taxes for free in 2025,"Tax season is upon us and there are numerous ways to file your taxes for free, especially if you meet certain income requirements or have a simple tax return.



Some programs are offered directly by the government, while others are through partnerships with top tax software companies or sponsored by nonprofit organizations. In 2025, the IRS expanded its Direct File program into 25 states, with an estimated 30 million taxpayers eligible to use the system.

Direct File

Direct File is a free IRS program for filing a federal tax return online. For tax year 2024 (filing in 2025), Direct File is open to eligible taxpayers in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. To qualify, you must be a W-2 employee, receive Social Security or unemployment insurance or have an investment income of less than $1,500. You must also have a Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and a valid state ID or passport. You can't file with DirectFile if your 2024 wages were more than $200,000 ($160,200 if you had more than one employer) or if you're married filing separately and your wages were more than $125,000 Direct File can be used to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, but not much else. You also can't itemize deductions or report additional income, like capital gains or money from gig work or rental properties.

IRS Free File

If your state doesn't have Direct File yet, IRS Free File is a no-cost online service for filers with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. The program is a partnership between the IRS and eight leading tax prep sites, including TaxSlayer and FreeTaxUSA. You can choose which company to work with based on your income, age, location and filing needs. (Some partners also offer free state filing.) It's an opportunity many people overlook, however: About 70% of Americans qualified for IRS Free File in 2024, according to the Taxpayer Advocate, but less than 5% used it.



Even if you meet the income requirements, Free File might not accept the forms you need. There's also not much support to help you maximize your refund or minimize your tax liability.

What if I don't meet the Free File income requirement? If you don't meet the income requirement for Free File, you can still use the site's fillable forms. There's no guidance and only limited calculations, but you can still fill out the free electronic forms using IRS instructions. This option doesn't include any state tax preparation.

Free online tax software

Tax software companies do a great job of simplifying the filing process, offering guided assistance and the ability to upload tax documents and previous years' returns. Many offer free tiers for simple returns, though they typically have limited features and support. With TurboTax's basic tier you can report W-2 income, some interest and dividends, child tax credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit and deductions for student loan interest. According to TurboTax, about 37% of filers qualify to use its basic tier for free.

Banking app Chime* has invited members to file their state and federal taxes for free directly through its platform. Simple returns can be completed in as little as 24 minutes, according to the San Francisco–based fintech company, and members who set up direct deposit can get their federal tax refund up to six days early. Chime has partnered with tax software developers Column Tax and April to offer the service, which is backed up with a 100% accuracy guarantee: If a calculation error results in you being hit with IRS penalties, Chime will pay the fines up to $10,000. It also guarantees the biggest refund possible or it will pay the difference.



According to Chime, the in-app tax filing program allows for itemized deductions and covers a wide range of tax scenarios including W-2 income, income from retirement, unemployment insurance and Social Security and stock and crypto sales. MoneyLion made free filing available to customers with RoarMoney bank accounts in 2023. The following year, online banks Varo and Current followed suit.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance

The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program provides free in-person tax preparation to people with an AGI of $60,000 or less, with disabilities or with limited English skills. You will need to visit an office in person and may need to make an appointment. (You can find a provider near you here.)

Tax Counseling for the Elderly

Another IRS-backed program, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) funds nonprofit and community efforts that provide free tax preparation for filers 60 and older. Trained volunteers will help prepare simple returns and can answer retirement-related questions. (Some locations also offer self-filing options.) Check the IRS website or AARP Tax-Aide site locator tool to find a TCE-affiliated location in your area or call 888-227-7669.

MilTax

Sponsored by the Department of Defense, MilTax is a tax software program for U.S. service members, veterans and their families, with details on how to file in multiple states, how to report deployment and combat pay, and more. Eligible filers can electronically submit a federal return and up to three state returns free of charge.

Tax filing FAQs When are taxes due? For most taxpayers, the deadline to file a federal tax return is Tuesday, April 15, 2025, at midnight local time. Residents and businesses in parts of the country declared FEMA disaster areas have more time. What happens if you can't pay your taxes? If you don't have the money to pay your tax bill, you can ask the IRS for a short-term extension of up to 120 days, request a payment plan that will allow you to spread out the debt over months or years. You may also apply for an offer in compromise, but the odds of approval are not good. If you can prove financial hardship you may be able to qualify for ""currently not collectible status"" and avoid having to pay until your circumstances improve. When are state taxes due? For most states, the deadline to file is April 15, 2025, at midnight local time. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not collect state income taxes. The following states have different due dates: Hawaii: April 20, 2025

Delaware: April 30, 2025

Iowa: April 30, 2025

Virginia: May 1, 2024

Louisiana: May 15, 2025 For more information, consult with your state Department of Revenue.

How to check the status of your tax refund,"The IRS expects to receive more than 140 million individual tax returns for tax year 2024 ahead of the Apr. 15, 2025, federal deadline. Almost 80% of filers expect to receive a refund this year, according to a survey by tax software company TaxSlayer.

How to check the status of your refund

You can keep tabs on your refund with the IRS's Where's My Refund tool or with the IRS2Go app, which you can download from Apple's App Store, Google Play or Amazon. You'll need to know Social Security number or Individual Tax Identification Number to use either service, as well as your filing status and the exact amount of the refund you're expecting. The status of your return and any refund should be available within 24 hours of e-filing. The IRS typically updates information overnight, so you may need to check several times for current information.

Why is my refund taking so long?

A variety of issues can hold up a refund, including: A return with math errors or that is incomplete or unsigned

If the IRS suspects identity theft or fraud

If the IRS is challenging a credit you've claimed

You still owe the IRS a previous year's return

You're being audited for a prior tax year

Your bank or credit union has not posted the refund If you're claiming the earned income tax credit, those refunds can't go out before mid-February, but the IRS says filers should receive their funds by March 3, 2025.

Can I call the IRS about my refund?

According to the IRS, you should only call if it's been at least 21 days since you filed an electronic return or at least six weeks since you mailed a print return.



For questions about individual federal returns, call 800-829-1040, Monday through Friday between 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (The wait time during tax season may be considerable.) You can also make an appointment to get help at a local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center. The agency does not accept tax-related questions by email.

Tax refund FAQs How do I check my income tax refund status? You can get updates on the status of your refund on the IRS2Go app or the IRS ""Where's My Refund"" tool. Why is my refund taking so long? A refund will take longer if you file by mail or don't select direct deposit. In addition, if the return is more complex or corrections are needed, it may slow the process down. How long does it take to get a refund if you e-file? The IRS completes nine out of ten direct deposit refunds within 21 days. You can begin tracking the status of your refund within 24 hours of e-filing. How long should I hold onto my tax returns?

2024-2025 federal tax brackets and income tax rates,"The tax brackets you fall into determine how much you owe the IRS at tax time. For tax year 2024 (filing in 2025), there are seven brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%.



That will remain the same for tax year 2025 (filing in 2026), but the IRS adjusts the income range for each bracket annually to account for inflation's impact on salaries.



Depending on how much you make and your filing status, parts of your earnings will likely fall under different brackets. Here are the income ranges for tax brackets for tax years 2024 and 2025, as well as how to figure out which brackets apply to you and ways to lower your taxable income.

Tax brackets for 2024 (for taxes due in 2025)

There are seven tax rates for 2024, ranging from 10% to 37%. The income range in each bracket increased 5.4% from 2023. In 2024, the maximum 37% rate only applies to individual filers earning over $609,350 and married couples filing jointly who made a combined total of at least $731,200.

Tax Rate Single Married filing jointly Married filing separately Head of household 10% $11,600 or less $23,200 or less $11,600 or less $16,550 or less 12% $11,601 to $47,150 $23,201 to $94,300 $11,601 to $47,150 $16,551 to $63,100 22% $47,151 to $100,525 $94,301 to $201,050 $47,151 to $100,525 $63,101 to $100,500 24% $100,526 to $191,950 $201,051 to $383,900 $100,526 to $191,950 $100,501 to $191,950 32% $191,951 to $243,725 $383,901 to $487,450 $191,951 to $243,725 $191,951 to $243,700 35% $243,726 to $609,350 $487,451 to $731,200 $243,726 to $365,600 $234,701 to $609,350 37% Over $609,350 Over $731,200 Over $365,600 Over $609,350

Tax brackets for 2025 (for taxes due in 2026)

Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the brackets for tax year 2025 will remain the same as they were in 2024. However, the IRS increased the income thresholds for each tier by 2.8%.

Tax Rate Single Married filing jointly Married filing separately Head of household 10% $11,925 or less $23,850 or less $11,925 or less $17,00 or less 12% $11,926 to $48,475 $23,851 to $96,950 $11,926 to $48,475 $17,001 to $64,850 22% $48,476 to $103,350 $96,951 to $206,700 $48,476 to $103,350 $64,851 to $103,350 24% $103,351 to $197,300 $206,701 to $394,600 $103,351 to $197,300 $103,351 to $197,300 32% $197,301 to $250,525 $394,601 to $501,050 $197,301 to $250,525 $197,301 to $250,500 35% $250,526 to $626,350 $501,051 to $751,600 $250,526 to $375,800 $250,501 to $626,350 37% Over $626,350 Over $751,600 Over $375,800 Over $626,350

Source: Internal Revenue Service

The TCJA is slated to sunset at the end of 2025. Without action from Congress, the brackets will revert to 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%.

What tax bracket am I in?

Because the IRS utilizes progressive rates, few people fall into a single tax bracket. If you're an individual filer who earned $45,000 in taxable income in 2024, for example, the amount you owe will be broken into two tax brackets: 10% for the first $11,600

12% for any income between $11,601 and $47,150 If you earn $45,000 in 2025, however, the breakdown could look somewhat different. 10% for the first $11,925

12% for income between $11,926 and $48,475

What is a marginal tax rate?

Your marginal tax rate is the highest bracket you qualify for — or the percentage your last dollar of taxable income is taxed at. If you earned $70,000 in 2024 and file individually, for example, you have a marginal tax rate of 22%. That's because a portion of your income fell within the $47,151 to $100,525 bracket. But only $22,849 (or $70,000 - $47,151) is at that rate. Your first $11,000 of taxable income is taxed at the 10% tier, and then the next $35,549 (or $47,150 - $11,601) falls into the 12% bracket.

What is an effective tax rate?

While your marginal tax rate is the rate you pay on your highest dollar of income, your effective tax rate is the total percentage of income you pay in taxes. To determine your effective tax rate, you need to divide your total tax by your taxable income. You can find your total tax on line 24 of Form 1040 and your taxable income on line 15.

What is my filing status?

Your filing status determines your annual tax liability, as well as your filing requirements, standard deduction and eligibility for certain tax credits. Married filing jointly: You are married and able to file a joint return with your spouse or your spouse died during the tax year and you did not remarry. Married filing separately: You are married but have chosen to file separate returns. Head of household: You are an unmarried individual who is not claimed on someone else's return and who pays for over half of the care of at least one dependent. Surviving spouse: Your spouse died during the previous tax year. To claim this status you must file a joint tax return before their death and have at least one dependent child. Single: You are unmarried, divorced or legally separated as of the last day of the year and don't have a dependent or other person who qualifies you for any other filing status. Your marital status on December 31 determines whether you are considered single or married for that year.

How can I lower my taxable income?

There are several strategies to lower your tax rate that don't involve a pay cut. Some require itemizing, however. The standard deduction in 2024 is $14,600 for a single filer and $29,200 for married couples filing jointly, so your total deductions need to be more than that to make itemizing worth the effort. (In 2025, the standard deduction goes up to $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples.) 1. Claim tax credits Tax credits reduce the amount you owe, providing a dollar-for-dollar decrease in your tax liability. If you owe $2,000 in taxes and qualify for a $500 tax credit, for example, your tax liability is reduced to $1,500. You can learn about tax credits you may be eligible for on the IRS website, including: The Earned Income Tax Credit: If you earned less than $61,555 (or $68,675 if married and filing jointly), you can earn up to $8,046 based on your income and family size

If you earned less than $61,555 (or $68,675 if married and filing jointly), you can earn up to $8,046 based on your income and family size Child Tax Credit : Worth up to $1,700 per qualifying dependent child depending on your modified adjusted gross income.

: Worth up to $1,700 per qualifying dependent child depending on your modified adjusted gross income. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit: Claim up to 35% of daycare, dependent care and related expenses, up to $3,000 (or up to $6,000 for two or more children).

Claim up to 35% of daycare, dependent care and related expenses, up to $3,000 (or up to $6,000 for two or more children). American Opportunity Tax Credit: If you earn $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less if married filing jointly) you can claim $2,500 for qualified tuition costs, school fees, and course materials.

If you earn $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less if married filing jointly) you can claim $2,500 for qualified tuition costs, school fees, and course materials. The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit: Worth up to $7,500 if you purchase an eligible EV. 2. Deduct student loan interest While tax credits directly reduce your tax bill, tax deductions lower your taxable income by letting you subtract certain expenses. If you, your spouse or a dependent have federal or private student loans, for example, you can deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest each year. This write-off begins to phase out if your modified adjusted gross income hits $70,000, however, and disappears entirely at $90,000. If you're married and filing jointly, the phaseout starts at $155,000 and disappears if you earn $185,000 or more. 3. Max out your retirement accounts You can also claim deductions for contributions to qualifying pre-tax retirement accounts like an employer-sponsored 401(k) or traditional IRA. With pre-tax contributions, you're taking less out of your paycheck now. However, because your money is growing tax-deferred, you'll pay income tax on it when you start withdrawing. 4. Contribute to a Health Savings Account If you have a high-deductible healthcare plan, a Health Savings Account (HSA) allows you to save for upcoming medical expenses. Contributions are tax-free (or tax-deductible if self-funded) and the balance can grow tax-free through investments. Withdrawals are also tax-free if used for eligible expenses — like deductibles or copays, prescriptions, medical devices and even birth control. Some companies also offer flexible spending accounts (FSA), which lower your taxable income by allowing pre-tax contributions. FSAs don't let you invest, however, and the funds generally don't roll over to the following year. 5. Sell losing stocks If you own stocks that performed badly this year, you can use your losses to offset the taxes you would pay on other investment gains — a process called tax-loss harvesting. If you have no capital gains this year, your losses can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income — anything beyond that can carry over and be used to lower taxes. in the future.

Tax bracket FAQs How do tax brackets work? Tax brackets are the various tiers your income is taxed at. You only pay a higher rate on the portion of your income that falls into that bracket, not your entire paycheck. If you earned $40,000 in 2024, for example, the first $11,600 of your income would be taxed at 10% ($1,160) while the next $13,800 would be taxed at 12% ($1,656). Your total tax liability would be $2,816. How do I calculate my tax bracket? To calculate your tax bracket, determine your total taxable income after deductions. Then, match that income to the corresponding range in the tax bracket chart for your filing status to see the rate that applies to each portion of your income. Your taxable income will likely span multiple brackets depending on your earnings. Does a Roth IRA put you in a different tax bracket? A Roth IRA doesn't change your tax bracket because contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you've already paid taxes on the money. What is the highest tax bracket? The highest tax bracket is currently 37%. For tax year 2025, only single filers earning at least $626,350 (or married couples filing jointly earning at least $751,600) will pay that rate on any portion of their income. With the TCJA sunsetting in 2025, however, the highest bracket could be 39.6% in 2026 What is the standard deduction for 2025? For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately for tax year 2025, the standard deduction is $15,000, an increase of $400 from 2024. For married couples filing jointly, it's $30,000, up $800 from 2024. For heads of households, it's $22,500, up $600 from 2024.

OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card

Who's this for? If you have bad credit and have struggled to be approved for cards in the past, you may want to consider a card that doesn't perform a credit check. The OpenSky® Secured Visa® Credit Card doesn't pull your credit when you apply. Like other secured cards, a minimum $200 security deposit is required to open the card and you can deposit up to $3,000. While this card is great for no credit check, it does come with a $35 annual fee, unlike the other cards mentioned above that have no annual fee. The annual fee can be worthwhile if you're trying to build your credit and you have trouble qualifying for cards other cards. [ Return to card summary ]

Discover it® Secured Credit Card

Who's this for? The Discover it® Secured Credit Card is a well-rounded secured card that offers many of the benefits that are typically found with unsecured cards. Cardholders can earn cash back, receive a generous welcome bonus, use the card overseas without incurring added fees and more — all for no annual fee. Cardholders earn a competitive 2% cash back at Gas Stations and Restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, automatically. Plus earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. The welcome bonus is also unique: For new card members in the first year only, Discover will automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year. If you earn $25 cash back at the end of the first year, Discover will give you an additional $25. This card requires a $200 security deposit, which is fairly standard for secured credit cards. It stands out from the crowd because cardholders have a clear path to upgrading to an unsecured card (and getting their deposit back). Starting at seven months from account opening, Discover will automatically review your credit card account to see if they can transition you to an unsecured line of credit and return your deposit. This takes the guesswork out of wondering when you'll qualify for an unsecured credit card. [ Return to card summary ]

Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card

Who's this for? If you're looking for a secured card with a low deposit, the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card is your best option. This card has no annual fee and minimum security deposits starting as low as $49, $99 or $200, based on your creditworthiness. If you qualify for the low $49 or $99 deposits, you'll still receive a $200 credit limit. This is a great feature considering many secured cards require $200 deposits to receive an equivalent line of credit. By using your card responsibly and making on-time payments, you may be able to improve your credit score and be considered for a credit line increase in as little as six months. In addition to paying on time, make sure you pay in full, since this card has a very high 29.74% variable APR. [ Return to card summary ]

DCU Visa® Platinum Secured Credit Card

Who's this for? The DCU Visa® Platinum Secured Credit Card offers one of the lowest interest rates for a no annual fee secured card at 16.75% variable APR. While we don't recommend carrying a balance month-to-month (especially when you're trying to build or rebuild credit), it can be a good idea to choose a low interest secured card if you have a history of carrying balances or you're looking for a safety net. There is a higher-than-average $500 minimum security deposit to open the card. But it does come with some additional perks, including travel insurance, auto rental collision damage waiver and extended warranty protection. Membership to the Digital Federal Credit Union is required, but anyone can join in one of several ways: if you're a friend or family member of a DCU member, live in select communities, work for select employers or make a one-time contribution (as low as $10) to a participating organization.

Our methodology

To determine which credit cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed 234 of the most popular credit cards available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including: annual fee, minimum security deposit, credit limit, rewards program, introductory and standard APR, welcome bonuses and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit score and customer reviews when available. We also took into account how easy it is to upgrade the card from secured to unsecured and how quickly you can get your security deposit back. Because it's unusual for secured credit cards to have robust rewards programs, we did not analyze how many rewards points you can earn in the first year. For cardholders who are looking to rebuild credit, it's more important to practice good credit card habits — spending within your means, paying your balance on time and in full — than try to optimize your points balance.

Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms.

OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount.

What is considered a bad credit score?

Here is how lenders classify ""fair"" and ""poor"" credit scores: FICO Score Very poor: 300 to 579

Fair: 580 to 669

Good: 670 to 739

Very good: 740 to 799

Excellent: 800 to 850 VantageScore Very poor: 300 to 499

Poor: 500 to 600

Fair: 601 to 660

Good: 661 to 780

Excellent: 781 to 850 A good credit score starts at 670 on the FICO scale and 661 for VantageScore. Anything over 740 is considered very good, and above an 800 FICO® score (or 781 VantageScore) is considered excellent. Scores lower than 670, and certainly scores lower than 600, will most likely disqualify you for the most affordable personal loans. But if you're in a pinch, it's not all-out impossible to get a loan with a credit score in the high 500s or low 600s. See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.

Tips to qualify for a bad credit loan

Qualifying for a loan if you have bad credit may be tricky but you can take steps to improve your chances of approval, including: Checking your credit: While you might already know your credit requires some work, knowing your score can help you weed out personal loan lenders whose credit requirements you aren't likely to meet. Plus, checking your credit report for errors and disputing them might have a positive effect on your scores.

Pre-qualification can help you determine whether you're likely to be approved for a loan. Additionally, you'll see your estimated loan terms, which will allow you to shop around for the best rates. Using a co-signer or co-borrower: If a family member or trusted friend has a good credit score, you can ask them to be a co-signer or co-borrower on your loan. Co-signers have no access to loan funds or payment information but agree to repay the loan if the borrower fails to make payments. Co-borrowers, on the other hand, can access the funds and payment information and are also responsible for the loan and any missed or late payments. Note that if you don't repay the loan as agreed, your co-borrower's or co-signer's credit will be negatively impacted along with yours.

Adding collateral: You can secure your personal loan by adding collateral. For example, you might be able to pledge your car or money in your savings account as collateral. If you fail to repay the loan, the lender has the right to take your collateral. This makes a secured personal loan risky but also more accessible to borrowers with low credit scores.

Including additional income: Many lenders allow you to add non-employment income on your loan application, such as Social Security payments, alimony or child support. A higher income can improve your chances of getting approved.

Alternatives to high-interest loans

Bad credit might stop you from qualifying for credit products like 0% APR credit cards or low-interest personal loans. If you want to avoid paying high interest rates, you can look into the following alternatives: Peer-to-peer (P2P) loans: P2P loans are offered by individual investors rather than financial institutions. These lenders might be more willing to work with borrowers with lower credit scores and offer lower interest rates.

P2P loans are offered by individual investors rather than financial institutions. These lenders might be more willing to work with borrowers with lower credit scores and offer lower interest rates. Life insurance policy loan: If you have life insurance, you can borrow from its cash value using your policy as collateral. Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan.

If you have life insurance, you can borrow from its cash value using your policy as collateral. Typically, this type of loan doesn't require a credit check and might offer more favorable terms than a personal loan. 401(k) loan: You may be able to borrow money from your workplace retirement account. You'll have to repay it with interest, but the interest will go back into your 401(k) account along with balance payments. This type of loan also usually doesn't have a minimum credit requirement. Note, however, that a 401(k) loan should be one of the last resort options as the money you borrow from your retirement account loses the potential to keep growing over time, decreasing your future retirement savings.

What's the difference between secured vs. unsecured loans?

A secured loan is a loan backed by collateral. The most common types of secured loans are mortgages and car loans, where the collateral is your home or car. But really, collateral can be any kind of financial asset you own. And if you don't pay back your loan, the bank can seize your collateral as payment. A repossession stays on your credit report for up to seven years. An unsecured loan requires no collateral, though you're still charged interest and sometimes fees. Student loans, personal loans and credit cards are all examples of unsecured loans. Since there's no collateral, financial institutions give out unsecured loans based in large part on your credit score, income and history of repaying past debts. For this reason, unsecured loans may have higher interest rates (but not always) than a secured loan.

Pros and cons of bad credit loans

Potential borrowers should always carefully consider the type of loan they're seeking as well as the loan terms. While bad credit personal loans can be a great tool if used wisely, there are still some advantages and disadvantages to consider. Pros You gain access to an unsecured personal loan. These types of loans can give you the financial flexibility to see you through a rough patch or cover an emergency, provided you manage the debt with care.

These types of loans can give you the financial flexibility to see you through a rough patch or cover an emergency, provided you manage the debt with care. You can (sometimes) get a lower rate with a co-signer. Some lenders specializing in borrowers with bad credit will let you take on a co-signer to improve your qualification chances. A co-signer may also help you get better interest rates.

Some lenders specializing in borrowers with bad credit will let you take on a co-signer to improve your qualification chances. A co-signer may also help you get better interest rates. You can potentially improve your credit score. Paying back your loan on time each month can also help improve your credit score since payment history accounts for 35% of it. Cons Applying for a new loan can temporarily lower your credit score. Because the lender will perform a hard credit check on you, your credit score will take a small dip. This is temporary and practicing positive credit habits will help you raise your credit score.

Because the lender will perform a hard credit check on you, your credit score will take a small dip. This is temporary and practicing positive credit habits will help you raise your credit score. You may get a high rate. Typically, lenders offer the lowest interest rates to individuals with higher credit scores. So if you apply with a low credit score, be prepared for higher interest rate offers.

Typically, lenders offer the lowest interest rates to individuals with higher credit scores. So if you apply with a low credit score, be prepared for higher interest rate offers. You may only qualify for a small loan amount. Many lenders consider your credit score when determining the loan amount to offer you. If you need significantly more money, you may have a hard time qualifying for a larger loan with a low credit score.

FAQs Can I pre-qualify without hurting my credit score? Most lenders provide the option to pre-qualify with a soft credit inquiry that doesn't affect your scores. Do personal loans build credit? If you always pay your loan on time, it can build your credit — provided the lender reports your payments to the credit bureaus. Can I borrow money with a 500 credit score? Some lenders work with borrowers with bad credit, but you can expect higher interest rates and fees.

Our methodology

To determine which personal loans are best for bad credit, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. When possible, we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

FAQs

Can I apply for debt consolidation with bad credit?

It's possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan with bad credit (a credit score of under 670). However, it's important to pay attention to the terms. Interest rates on personal loans for poor credit may at times exceed APRs on credit cards, especially if you apply with a low credit score. When that's the case, taking out a loan to get rid of your debt might not be the best option. Instead, consider other ways to tackle your balances. For instance, you might be able to negotiate repayment terms with your current creditors. It can also be a good idea to look into credit counseling and get help creating a debt management plan.

Why can't I get a debt consolidation loan?

Even with debt consolidation loans for bad credit, approval isn't guaranteed. Lenders typically look at multiple factors when evaluating a loan application. For example, you might be denied if you don't meet income requirements or if your debt-to-income ratio is too high. Note that any lender that denies your credit application must disclose the specific reasons it has turned you down within 60 days under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

What is the downside to consolidating debt?

Debt consolidation might be an excellent debt repayment strategy but it's not perfect for everyone. Here are some disadvantages to consider: You may end up with a higher interest rate. This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term.

This is especially true if you have less-than-ideal credit. Or, even if you get a lower APR, you might still pay more in interest if you've picked a long loan term. You may pay upfront costs. Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt.

Debt consolidation loans typically charge loan origination fees which can run high if you're dealing with a large debt. You might be tempted to continue spending. Merging multiple balances into one loan may feel like a weight off your shoulders. However, if you know you have trouble living below your means or saving enough, you might fall back into your old patterns once you feel free of debt. To avoid that, be disciplined about your budget and make a point to prioritize debt repayment.

How long does it take to get approved for a debt consolidation loan?

You can expect to receive the lender's decision within a few business days. However, many lenders might also approve you instantly. For a smooth process, make sure you provide any documentation the lender requires with your application and promptly respond to requests for more information.

How to choose the best debt consolidation loan

Shopping around is crucial when you're choosing a lender or financial product. When determining the best debt consolidation loan for you, look beyond the APRs. While the interest rate is often the deciding factor, you should also pay attention to other costs associated with the loan. For instance, some lenders charge origination fees which can get as high as 10% of the loan amount. Additionally, pay attention to extra features and user experience the lender offers. For example, do they provide a convenient way for the borrower to manage their loan virtually? Is there an option to chat with customer service online? And finally, it can be helpful to read customer reviews on websites like the Better Business Bureau to ensure the lender offers a solid level of service.

Alternatives to debt consolidation

A debt consolidation loan might be hard to secure if you have credit issues, and even then, the terms might not be favorable. Some alternatives to debt consolidation you can look into include: Mortgage refinancing : If you have a mortgage, you may be able to replace it with a new larger one and use the difference to consolidate debt. This type of loan is called ""cash-out refinance"". Note that most lenders require a credit score of at least 620 to qualify.

Note that most lenders require a credit score of at least 620 to qualify. Negotiating with your lenders: When managing your debt becomes challenging, don't be afraid to reach out to your lenders and credit card issuers. While not guaranteed, they may be able to offer help. For example, they may agree to lower your interest rate, develop a payment plan or provide other arrangements to make your loan more manageable. It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions.

It's always best to keep open communication with your financial institutions. Credit counseling: In a credit counseling program, a certified financial expert will take an in-depth look at your finances and offer steps to improve your situation. For instance, they may recommend a debt management program where the credit counseling organization would develop a payment plan with your lenders for you. The most reputable organizations are nonprofits and don't charge for their services (or require a low fixed rate). You can search for a credit counseling provider at the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA).

You can search for a credit counseling provider at the National Federation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) and the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA). Debt relief: Debt relief companies can also negotiate what you owe with your creditors for a fee. However, debt settlement comes with potential risks as it requires that you stop making payments while the negotiation is in process. This can cause a huge hit to your credit score. Even worse, some lenders may try to sue you. Keeping this in mind, you might want to consider debt settlement the last-resort option.

Bottom line

Consolidating debt may be a difficult task if your credit score isn't perfect. Luckily, it's still possible to qualify for a debt consolidation loan even with a low score. It's important to do the math before taking out a debt consolidation loan. Check the APR before applying if the lender offers this option and factor in origination fees to determine whether a debt consolidation loan will save you money. If not, you might be better off finding a different strategy to deal with your debt.

Our methodology

To determine which debt consolidation loans are the best for consumers with bad credit, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

The loans on our list deliver funds promptly through either an electronic wire transfer to your checking account or in the form of a paper check. Some lenders (which we noted) offer the ability to pay your creditors directly. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $50,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Who's this for? While SoFi generally accepts good or excellent credit for its personal loan products, borrowers can apply for a loan using a co-applicant. A co-applicant can be beneficial for someone who has damaged or poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees, or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, providing you don't need to apply with additional information. Plus, when you sign up for a SoFi Personal Loan, you can join its membership platform to take advantage of a host of other perks like career counseling, financial advising and more.

Who's this for? Upstart usually approves applicants with a FICO score of 300 or higher, but this lender also accepts applicants with no credit history, making it a good choice for someone who needs to borrow a larger amount of money but doesn't have sufficient credit history. Just keep in mind that if you are approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate. You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more accessible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. It's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.

No co-signers *You must complete a loan application and continue to meet any criteria used to select you for a loan offer. Not all applicants are approved. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees.

Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. Borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms between 24 months and 60 months. This lender generally approves applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score but, like SoFi, you may be able to get a co-applicant on board to improve your chances of approval if you have insufficient credit history. Another thing that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a ""promise"" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state).

Upstart Personal Loans

Upstart is an AI-driven online lending platform that connects borrowers with lenders. It doesn't charge penalties for paying off your balance early, but it does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). Loan amounts $1,000 to $50,000 Terms 36 to 60 months [ Return to lender summary ]

OneMain Financial

OneMain Financial offers borrowers with less-than-perfect credit access to financial products like loans and credit cards. It stands out for allowing you to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But with secured loans, you agree to sign over an asset (such as your car) to the lender if you fail to repay the loan. OneMain Financial gives certain borrowers the option to take out a secured personal loan, which can sometimes result in a lower interest rate than an unsecured loan. Plus, borrowers can choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state). Loan amounts $1,500 to $20,000 Terms 24, 36, 48, 60 Months [ Return to lender summary ]

Avant

Avant is an online fintech platform with the mission to improve the borrowing experience for middle-income consumers. It doesn't charge any penalties for paying off your loan balance early, but there is an origination fee of up to 4.75% and a late fee of up to $25 after the 10-day grace period. Loan amounts $2,000 to $35,000 Terms 24 to 60 months [ Return to lender summary ]

Universal Credit

Universal Credit is a part of Upgrade, which is another lending company in the personal space. It has a low minimum credit score requirement and doesn't charge any prepayment penalties for paying your loan off early. It does, however, charge an origination fee that can range from 5.25% to 9.99%, which can be a bit high especially compared to that of some other lenders on this list. Loan amounts $1,000 to $50,000 Terms 36 to 60 months [ Return to lender summary ]

Oportun

Oportun boasts an expedient application process that should only take around 10 minutes to complete, according to the lender's website. To apply, you'll need to have your ID, proof of address, proof of income and a list of any recurring monthly debt payments handy. Loan amounts $300 to $10,000 Terms 12 to 54 months [ Return to lender summary ]

Can I pre-qualify without hurting my credit score?

It is possible to pre-qualify for a personal loan without hurting your credit score. Do some research before you apply. Read reviews and learn what to consider before agreeing to take on a loan. When you're ready to apply, follow these steps to ensure you don't ding your score too much. Shop around for the best rate. Avoid hard inquiries by knowing your credit score before you submit a formal application so you know what you might qualify for. Many lenders will allow you to submit a prequalification form. Or consider using a lending platform (such as Upstart or LendingTree) to view multiple offers at once. Decide on the best offer. Choose the loan with the best monthly payment and interest rate for your budget. Be sure to look at how much the loan will cost you over the full length of the term and decide if the cost is worth it. Submit a formal application. Have your social security number on hand, as well as supporting documents such as bank statements and paystubs. Wait for final approval. This could take just a few minutes, an hour or up to 10 days. To facilitate speedier approval, apply during normal business hours and submit the required documents right away. Get your funds. Once your loan is approved, you'll be asked to input your bank account information so the funds are deposited into your account. You may also be able to request a paper check from your lender, or in the case of a consolidation loan, you may be able to have funds sent right to your creditors.

What kind of loan can I get with a 580 credit score?

While FICO credit scores below 580 are considered poor, you still have access to traditional personal loans. All the lenders on this list accept applicants with bad credit scores but keep in mind you'll be subjected to higher interest rates and may only qualify for shorter loan repayment terms. If you have a low credit score, you can also qualify for payday loans, but this is generally only recommended as an absolute last resort. While payday loans approve applicants with subpar credit scores, they can also have triple-digit interest rates that can easily demolish your finances. It's better to exhaust all alternatives before even going near a payday loan.

What is a good credit score for a personal loan?

Most personal loan lenders consider good to excellent credit scores, which means a FICO score of at least 670. The higher your credit score, the more likely you'll be to get approved for the best personal loan rates.

FAQs Can I get a personal loan with a 500 credit score? It is possible to get a personal loan with a 500 credit score, however, you're unlikely to receive favorable terms like a low interest rate. What is the easiest loan to get with bad credit? If you have bad credit, you may have an easier time qualifying for a secured personal loan that requires a co-signer. Or, you may seek out lenders that have a lower minimum credit score requirement. Can you pay off a personal loan early? It is advantageous to pay off a personal loan early since you'll save on interest charges. Just make sure the lender doesn't charge any prepayment penalties for paying off your loan early.

Why trust CNBC Select?

Our methodology

To determine which personal loans are the best for consumers with a credit score of 580 or lower, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. When possible, we chose loans with no origination or sign-up fees, but we also included options for borrowers with lower credit scores on this list. Some of those options have origination fees. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $1,000 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. The rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee your interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a loan, many lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Who's this for? Sometimes, a potential borrower may have a low credit score because they have extremely limited credit activity. Other times, a lack of credit history may result in them having no credit score at all. Because of this, Upstart accepts applicants with no credit history — though this lender also looks at applicants with a FICO score of 300 or higher. Just keep in mind that if you are approved for the loan with a lower (or no) credit score, you may be subject to a higher interest rate. You can apply for loan amounts as low as $1,000 and as much as $50,000. And while there are no penalties for paying off your balance early, Upstart does charge an origination fee (up to 12% of the amount you borrow) and late fees ($15 or 5% of the past due balance, whichever is greater). When it comes to repaying the balance, loan terms range from 36 to 60 months, which can be appealing to borrowers who think they may need a longer time horizon to repay the entire loan.

Who's this for? Upgrade typically looks at borrowers who have fair or good credit. With FICO, fair or good credit scores fall within the ranges of 580 to 739, and with VantageScore, fair or good ranges between 601 to 780. Many personal loan lenders offer amounts starting around $3,000 to $5,000, but with Upgrade, you can apply for as little as $1,000 (and as much as $50,000). The $1,000 minimum makes the loan feel a little more digestible for those who don't need to borrow too much money. This is especially important because it's generally best to only apply for what you'll need since borrowing more will result in higher monthly payments. Also keep in mind that Upgrade personal loans have an origination fee of up to 9.99%, which is deducted directly from your loan proceeds. So, if you know you'll need $1,000, you should account for the origination fee and apply for a loan amount closer to $1,080 to cover all your bases. Upgrade doesn't have any prepayment penalties, but it does have a late fee: If you pay late or miss a payment, you could be hit with a $10 late fee if your payment is not received in full within 15 calendar days of the due date. Otherwise, these loans are fast and easy to secure, and the funds should arrive in your checking account within one business day of submitting the required documents and being approved.

No co-signers *You must complete a loan application and continue to meet any criteria used to select you for a loan offer. Not all applicants are approved. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on applicant's state of residence and ability to meet OneMain Financial credit standards such as a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and if applicable, availability of eligible collateral. Not all approved applicants qualify for larger loan amounts, lower APRs, or the most favorable loan terms. For example, larger loan amounts typically require a first lien on a motor vehicle that is no more than ten years old, meets our value requirements, and is titled in applicant's name with valid insurance. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR that is repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. OneMain charges origination fees allowed by law. Depending on the state where the loan is opened, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the loan amount. Flat fees vary by state, ranging from $25 to $500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. For information about these fees and minimum and maximum loan sizes available in certain states, visit omf.com/loanfees. Current OneMain Customers: Loan offers presented to a consumer assume the individual has no active loan with OneMain or one of its affiliates. If a customer applies for a new loan offer, a OneMain representative will discuss available options. Active-duty military, their spouse or dependents covered by the Military Lending Act (MLA) may not pledge any vehicle as collateral. If you are covered by the MLA, you are not eligible for secured loans.Loan proceeds cannot be used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined by the CFPB's Regulation Z such as college, university or vocational expense; for any business or commercial purpose; to purchase cryptocurrency assets, securities, derivatives or other speculative investments; or for gambling or illegal purposes.

Who's this for? OneMain Financial offers loan options that are much less rigid compared to other lenders. This lender generally accepts applicants with at least a poor or fair credit score, but if you're worried your credit score will hurt your chances of securing a better interest rate, you may be able to submit your application with a co-applicant. Plus, borrowers can take advantage of repayment terms with a bit more flexibility compared to that of some lenders as terms range from 24 months to 60 months. Another feature that makes this lender a little more flexible is the ability to secure your loan with collateral. Personal loans are generally unsecured debt, meaning you can borrow the money outright without having to offer up something of value. But with secured loans, a borrower essentially uses another asset as a ""promise"" that if they fail to repay their loan in full, the lender can seize that asset from them as collateral. Not only does OneMain Financial give you this option, but doing so also lets you potentially receive an even lower interest rate. Plus, borrowers can actually choose the date their monthly payments are due. The origination fee with OneMain Financial is on the higher end: either a fixed fee between $25 and $500 or up to 10% of the loan amount, depending on which state you live in. And while there aren't any penalties for paying off the loan early, there is a late fee that will run you either $30 or up to 15% (depending on your state). See if you're pre-approved for a personal loan offer.

SoFi rate ranges are current as of 02/06/2024 and are subject to change without notice. The average of SoFi Personal Loans funded in 2022 was around $30K. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed and will depend on the term you select, evaluation of your creditworthiness, income, and a variety of other factors. Learn More View More

Who's this for? SoFi actually only considers applicants with good or excellent credit for its personal loan products. However, because this lender is very open to borrowers who need a co-applicant, it's still worth considering if your credit score is closer to the poor/fair range. A co-applicant on a personal loan can be beneficial for someone who has damaged credit, poor credit or a credit history that's so insufficient that they likely may not be approved for the loan if they applied alone. Or, sometimes a co-applicant can be used to give qualifying borrowers with an already good credit score an extra boost for securing better interest rates. An ideal co-applicant will have a higher credit score and higher income. These attributes tell lenders that the borrowers are more likely to be able to afford to repay the loan. The co-applicant is also financially on the hook for repaying the loan if the other co-applicant fails to make payments. SoFi doesn't charge any late fees or early payoff fees. And, you can borrow between $5,000 to $100,000, which makes SoFi an attractive option for people who need to borrow larger amounts for bigger expenses. You can get your loan funded the same day, or the next business day, provided you don't need to apply with additional information. Plus, when you sign up for a SoFi Personal Loan, you can join its membership platform to take advantage of a host of other perks like career counseling, financial advising and more.

Here are some common personal loan terms you need to know before applying for one. Co-applicants or joint applications: A co-applicant is a broad term for another person who helps you qualify by attaching their name (and financial details) to your application. A co-applicant can be a co-signer or a co-borrower. Having a co-applicant can be helpful when you have a poor or fair credit score. If your co-applicant has a good credit score, you might be offered better terms, including qualifying for a lower APR and/or a bigger loan. However, both applicants' credit scores will be affected if you don't pay back your loan, so be sure that your co-applicant is someone you feel comfortable sharing financial responsibility with.

Co-signers: A co-signer agrees to help you qualify for the loan, but they are only responsible for making payments if you are unable to. The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults.

The co-signer does not receive the loan, nor do they necessarily make decisions about how it is used. However, the co-signers credit will be negatively affected if the main borrower misses payments or defaults. Co-borrower: Unlike a co-signer, a co-borrower is responsible for paying back the loan and deciding how it is used. Co-borrowers are usually involved in decisions about how the loan is used. Some lenders will only consider two co-borrowers who share a home or business address, as this is a firm indicator that they are sharing the responsibility of money in mutually beneficial ways. Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults.

Both co-borrowers' credit scores are on the hook if either one stops making payments or defaults. Direct payments: Some lenders offer direct payments when you select debt consolidation as the reason for taking out a personal loan. With direct payments, the lender pays your creditors directly, and then deposits any leftover funds into your checking or savings account. Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges.

Until you see your account balance is fully paid off, it's best to keep making payments so that you don't get hit with additional late fees and interest charges. Early payoff penalty: Before you accept a loan, look to see if the lender charges an early payoff or prepayment penalty. Because lenders expect to get paid interest for the full term of your loan, they could charge you a fee if you make extra payments to pay your debt down quicker. The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate.

The fees could equal either the remaining interest you would have owed, a percentage of your payoff balance or a flat rate. Origination fee: An origination fee is a one-time upfront charge that your lender subtracts from your loan to pay for administration and processing costs. It is usually between 1% and 5%, but sometimes it is charged as a flat-rate fee. For example, if you took out a loan for $20,000 and there was a 5% origination fee, you would only receive $19,000 when you got your funds. Your lender would get $1,000 of the loan off the top , and you'd still have to pay back the full $20,000 plus interest. It's best to avoid origination fees if possible.

Unsecured versus secured loans: Most personal loans are unsecured, meaning they are not tied to collateral. However, if your credit score is less-than-stellar and you're finding it hard to qualify for the best loans, you can sometimes use a car, house or other assets to act as collateral in case you default on your payments. When you put an asset up as collateral, you are giving your lender permission to repossess it if you don't pay back your debts on time and in full.

Our methodology

To determine which personal loans are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. personal loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.

We noted the lenders that reward you for enrolling in autopay by lowering your APR by 0.25% to 0.5%. Creditor payment limits and loan sizes: The above lenders provide loans in an array of sizes, from $500 to $100,000. Each lender advertises its respective payment limits and loan sizes, and completing a preapproval process can give you an idea of what your interest rate and monthly payment would be for such an amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for having no credit history, borrowing smaller loan amounts, flexible terms, applying with a co-applicant and getting secured loan options. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for personal loans are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. Before providing a loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

Calculate your monthly mortgage payment

How your credit score impacts mortgage approval

Your credit score is one of the main factors lenders look at when deciding whether to approve your mortgage application and what rate to charge you. (The others are your debt-to-income ratio, your income and employment history and the size of your down payment.)



Your credit score, in turn, is calculated based on several criteria: Payment history (35%): Whether you pay your bills on time

Whether you pay your bills on time Amounts owed (30%): The Amount of credit and loans you're using compared to your total credit limit, also known as your credit utilization rate

The Amount of credit and loans you're using compared to your total credit limit, also known as your credit utilization rate Length of credit history (15%): The length of time you've had credit

The length of time you've had credit New credit (10%): How often you apply for and open new accounts

How often you apply for and open new accounts Credit mix (10%): Having a variety of installment loans and revolving credit accounts, including credit cards, auto loans, mortgages and personal loans The two biggest factors come from your record of on-time payments and the amount of credit you've used, which account for 65% of your score combined.



Broadly speaking, a higher credit score tells a lender you are more likely to make on-time mortgage payments.

What kind of mortgage can I get with bad credit?

While many lenders prefer a 620 credit score for approval for a conventional loan, there are other options. While the federal government doesn't set credit score requirements for VA or USDA loans, these are the scores most lenders want to see.

Mortgage type Minimum credit score Conventional loan 620 Jumbo loan 700 FHA loan 580 (or 500 with 10% down) VA loan 620 USDA loan 640



How to get a mortgage with bad credit

You have options if you want to buy a home with a credit score below 620. Consider an FHA loan FHA loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), so borrowers with a credit score as low as 500 can get approved if they put at least 10% down. With a 580 score, you can put as little as 3.5% down. Unlike other government-backed loans, eligibility is not limited by income, location or military service. Save for a larger down payment The larger your down payment, the easier it is to get a mortgage. Some lenders say they don't look for a minimum credit score but instead look at a borrower's complete financial profile. Bolstering your down payment can improve that financial profile. Get a cosigner If your credit is not up to snuff, you may be able to get a mortgage with the help of a cosigner with good credit and a steady income stream. A cosigner can be anyone, including a family member or friend, who agrees to assume responsibility for the mortgage if you fail to make payments.

How to improve your credit score

Getting ready to apply for a mortgage? Raising your credit score is the first step. 1. Pay bills on time Paying credit card bills and other debts on time is the most important thing you can do to raise your score. Your payment history is 35% of your FICO® score, making it the biggest determiner in your credit score. Paying the total amount due and not carrying a balance will keep your credit utilization rate low. (Experts recommend keeping your total utilization below 30%, but below 10% is even better.) Setting up autopay reduces the likelihood that you'll miss a payment. 2. Don't open new lines of credit Getting a new credit card or taking out a personal loan can hurt your credit in a few ways: Applying will require a hard inquiry which can temporarily lower your score — and if you're approved, the average age of your accounts will drop. 3. Request a credit limit increase One way to boost your credit score is to ask your credit card servicer to increase your credit limit. Provided you don't charge anything, that will increase your available credit and lower your credit utilization rate. 4. Check for errors in your credit reports Some 44% of consumers have found errors in their credit reports, according to an April 2024 study from Consumer Reports. it's always smart to monitor your credit reports for inaccuracies, whether they're honest mistakes or signs of fraud. You can use Aura, IdentityForce or another credit monitoring service to survey your reports from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.

Mortgage FAQs What credit score do I need to get a mortgage? For a conventional mortgage, lenders typically want a credit score of 620. However, you'll need a score of 760 for the best rates. What kinds of mortgages are easier to get approved for? Government-backed mortgages — like FHA, USDA, and VA loans — typically have more flexible credit score requirements than conventional loans. However, they may have other limitations: VA loans are limited to current or former service members, for example, and USDA loans are only for individuals who meet income and location requirements. What is the lowest credit score to get approved for a mortgage? You can qualify for an FHA loan with a score as low as 500 if you make a down payment of at least 10%. Requirements vary by lender, however. What is a non-qualifying mortgage? A non-qualified mortgage (or non-QM loan) doesn't conform to income and credit requirements the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sets. Non-QM loans can help people with poor credit, unusual income streams or a bankruptcy in their past get a mortgage, although the interest rates are significantly higher.

Our methodology

To determine which mortgage lenders are the best for low or no down payment, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of home loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks.



We focused on the following features: Credit score: We chose lenders with flexible credit requirements. Most lenders require a 620 FICO score to secure a conventional mortgage. The lenders chosen on this list offer loans that require a minimum credit score of less than this, or no credit score at all. Minimum down payment: We favored lenders that offered specialty loans with lower down payment requirements or that offered government-backed FHA, VA and USDA loans. Closing times: We gave more weight to lenders with shorter-than-average closing times or that guaranteed an on-time closing. Fees: The mortgage process includes origination, application and underwriting fees, as well as charges for appraisals, title insurance, attorneys and other closing costs. When possible, we noted if a lender had lower fees, discounts or waived certain fees. Application process: We considered whether lenders offered an online preapproval and application process and if there were physical branches for an in-person experience. Customer service: We gave more weight to lenders that scored highly on J.D. Power's mortgage origination and servicing surveys. We also noted if they had robust customer service phone hours and a website with an online chat feature and educational resources. We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. Our recommendations are sorted by best for low down payment, best for no credit, best for non-qualifying mortgages, best for refinancing, best for no private mortgage insurance, best for quick closing and best for military members and veterans.

What are ETFs and should you invest in them?,"TD Ameritrade, Inc. has been acquired by Charles Schwab, and all accounts have been moved. There are so many ways to invest your money to build your wealth. From stocks to bonds to index funds, there's a wide range of investment vehicles for every kind of investor depending on their goals. A common choice for beginner investors who want exposure to the overall stock market is to put money into an exchange-traded fund or ETF.

What are ETFs?

Think of ETFs as buckets that hold a collection of securities, like stocks and bonds. Because ETFs are made up of these multiple assets, they provide investors with instant diversification. When an investor purchases a share of an ETF, their money is spread across different investments. This differs from stocks where you buy shares of just a single company. ETFs typically mimic a market index like the S&P 500. Since ETF performance is usually based on an index — meaning they follow the ups and downs of said index — most are passively managed investments and thus likely have lower fees than mutual funds. Mutual funds, on the other hand, want to beat the market's performance and are thus managed by a fund manager, who's actively choosing the investments. Similar to stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange throughout the day, and investors can even earn dividends depending on the type of index the fund tracks.

Should you invest in ETFs?

Since ETFs offer built-in diversification and don't require large amounts of capital in order to invest in a range of stocks, they are a good way to get started. You can trade them like stocks while also enjoying a diversified portfolio. How to get started investing in ETFs First, you'll need to set up an online account through a broker or trading platform. After funding the account, you can purchase ETFs using their ticker symbol and indicating how many shares you want. Deciding on how many shares to buy largely depends on the current pricing of a share and your own financial situation. ETFs are good for beginners because they offer entry-level access: You can buy as little as a single share, and with some brokers, like Robinhood, you can even buy fractional shares. Fees vary by broker, but it's best to look for options with very low or no transaction costs. These days, many of the traditional brokerages offer commission-free trading on ETFs. Some of the best $0 commission trading platforms include the below: TD Ameritrade

Ally Invest

E*TRADE

Vanguard

Charles Schwab

Fidelity Though ETFs tracking the S&P 500 are some of the most popular, be aware that very few ETFs track the S&P 500 as a whole, rather just components of the index. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the entire index, and it has low management fees. Its current expense ratio is 0.03%, which means you pay just 30 cents per year for every $1,000 invested. For every $10,000 invested, that would equate to $3 per year.

Bottom line

You don't have to be so hands-on in order to invest with ETFs, and investing in them is an easy way to get started in the market. If you don't feel confident choosing ETFs, consider opening an account with a robo-advisor that automatically invests on your behalf. Many robo-advisors, like Betterment, recommend low-cost ETF portfolios so you can take advantage of this investing vehicle without having to do your research on all the different options available.

Dow closes 700 points lower as inflation and tariff fears worsen,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell in the Financial District of New York City on March 17, 2025.

Stocks sold off sharply on Friday, pressured by growing uncertainty on U.S. trade policy as well as a more grim outlook on inflation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 715.80 points, or 1.69%, at 41,583.90. The S&P 500 shed 1.97% to 5,580.94, ending the week down for the fifth time in the last six weeks. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.7% to settle at 17,322.99.

Shares of several technology giants dropped, putting pressure on the broader market. Google-parent Alphabet lost 4.9%, while Meta and Amazon each shed 4.3%.

This week, the S&P 500 lost 1.53%, while the 30-stock Dow shed 0.96%. The Nasdaq declined by 2.59%. With this latest losing week, Nasdaq is now on pace for a more than 8% monthly decline, which would be its worst monthly performance since December 2022.

Stocks took a leg lower on Friday after the University of Michigan's final read on consumer sentiment for March reflected the highest long-term inflation expectations since 1993.

Friday's core personal consumption expenditures price index also came out hotter-than-expected, rising 2.8% in February and reflecting a 0.4% increase for the month, stoking concerns about persistent inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective numbers of 2.7% and 0.3%. Consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast, according to fresh data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

""The market is getting squeezed by both sides. There is uncertainty around next week's reciprocal tariffs hitting the major exporting sectors like tech alongside concerns about a weakening consumer facing higher prices hitting areas like discretionary,"" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X.

Helfstein added, however, that the news on inflation and consumer spending ""was not that bad"" and could simply represent a hiccup in near-term sentiment as investors struggle to understand the Trump administration's new policies.

""Despite today's sell-off and broader market volatility of the past few weeks, there have not been big inflows into money markets. It seems like a lot of investors are trying to ride this out,"" he said.

The latest inflation report comes amid a flurry of tariff announcements from the White House, which have roiled the market in recent weeks. Investors are looking ahead to April 2, when President Donald Trump is expected to announce further tariff plans, for further clarity.

On Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Trump that the Canadian government will implement retaliatory tariffs following Wednesday's announcements. Bloomberg earlier reported that the European Union is identifying concessions it could make to Trump's administration to reduce the reciprocal tariffs from the U.S.

Deutsche Bank slashes Tesla price target as first-quarter deliveries come under pressure,"Deutsche Bank believes there is more room for Tesla 's first-quarter deliveries to slow. Analyst Edison Yu reiterated his buy rating on the electric vehicle maker but slashed his price target to $345 from $420. His revised forecast is now 26% above where shares closed Thursday. Yu noted he sees first-quarter deliveries ranging between 340,000 and 350,000, below a sell-side consensus of 378,000. This would represent an 11% year over year loss and a 30% quarter-over-quarter decline, as well as the lowest level since the third quarter of 2022. This also ""likely means auto margin will also be under greater pressure,"" he said. Tesla has seen a contentious year, with the stock giving up much of its postelection gain. Shares of Tesla have gained nearly 10% week to date, but are still down 32% on the year. TSLA 1Y mountain TSLA 1Y chart ""Our view is that Tesla's stock has been under pressure recently driven by much weaker auto volumes, broader de-rating in growth assets (e.g., Mag 7), and to some extent, political/policy uncertainty,"" Yu wrote. ""As we have seen over the years, rarely anything at Tesla happens in a straight line and we would not expect robotaxi or humanoid to be linear."" Yu also said some ""brand damage"" caused by Musk's political activities could hurt demand, which is something he will continue to monitor going forward. On the bright side, the company is in a good position to hedge against President Donald Trump's intention to levy a 25% auto tariff on ""all cars that are not made in the United States."" ""While the new 25% tariffs can hurt Tesla, mainly on the Mexico content (20-25% depending on the model), we estimate very minimal impact under the current guidelines (powertrain, electronic components) given Tesla likely sources mostly low value-add items from there,"" the analyst added.

"Core inflation in February hits 2.8%, higher than expected; spending increases 0.4%","The Federal Reserve's key inflation measure rose more than expected in February while consumer spending also posted a smaller-than-projected increase, the Commerce Department reported Friday.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index showed a 0.4% increase for the month, the biggest monthly gain since January 2024, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective numbers of 0.3% and and 2.7%.

Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is generally considered a better indicator of long-term inflation trends.

In the all-items measure, the price index rose 0.3% on the month and 2.5% from a year ago, both in line with forecasts.

At the same time, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%.

Stock market futures briefly moved lower following the release, as did Treasury yields.

Federal Reserve officials focus on the PCE inflation reading as they consider it a broader measure that also adjusts for changes in consumer behavior and places less of an emphasis on housing than the Labor Department's consumer price index. Shelter costs have been one of the stickier elements of inflation and rose 0.3% in the PCE measure.

""It looks like a 'wait-and-see' Fed still has more waiting to do,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. ""Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs.""

Good prices increased 0.2%, led by recreational goods and vehicles, which increased 0.5%. Gasoline offset some of the increase, with the category falling 0.8%. Services prices were up 0.4%.

Households also grew more cautious with their money, as the personal saving rate increased to 4.6%, the highest since June 2024.

The report comes with markets on edge that President Donald Trump's tariff intentions will aggravate inflation at a time when the data was making slow but steady progress back to the Fed's 2% goal.

After cutting rates a full percentage point in 2024, the central bank has been on hold this year, with officials of late expressing concern over the effect the import duties will have on prices. Economists tend to consider tariffs as one-off events that do not feed through to longer-lasting inflation pressures, but the encompassing scope of Trump's tariffs and the potential for an aggressive global trade war are changing the stakes.

Correction: Consumer spending increased 0.4% in February. An earlier headline misstated the number.

Trump's new auto tariffs will likely drive up car prices by thousands of dollars,"President Donald Trump's steep new tariffs on imported cars will likely jack up prices for U.S. buyers of both foreign and locally made vehicles, according to Wall Street analysts.

Trump on Wednesday said he will slap 25% tariffs on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as on key auto parts including engines, transmissions and powertrain components.

Prices that consumers pay on the lot could increase by $4,000 to $15,000 per vehicle, depending on how much of the car is imported, according to several analysts' estimates.

The tariffs will kick in at midnight on April 3, and Trump has said they will be ""permanent.""

There are some caveats: Importers of cars covered by the North American trade deal known as the USMCA will only face the tariff for the ""non-U.S. content"" of their vehicles. And those USMCA-compliant auto parts will be tariff-free until the Trump administration creates a process to apply the piecemeal tariffs.

While Trump's tariff agenda has been a wellspring of uncertainty for Wall Street, many analysts were quick to warn that his latest step could have major impacts to the auto industry.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/trump-auto-tariffs-car-prices-analysts.html,cnbc
"Bangkok declares ‘disaster zone’, at least 144 reported dead in Myanmar after earthquake","Thai rescue workers arrive on scene at a construction building collapse in the Chatuchak area following an earthquake on March 28, 2025 in Bangkok, Thailand. Lauren Decicca | Getty Images News | Getty Images

Bangkok authorities declared the Thai capital a ""disaster area"" on Friday, after a powerful earthquake in neighboring Myanmar created tremors which caused buildings to sway dramatically and one skyscraper under construction to collapse. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said the worst damage was to a 33-storey building that was being built in Chatuchak district. Sittipunt said 83 construction workers had been trapped inside. In an update shared to social media at 10 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET), the Bangkok Incident Command Center said 10 people had died. Footage of the building rapidly crumbling showed residents and tourists in the area running in panic. ""At present, the earthquake may still result in aftershocks, prompting Bangkok authorities to urgently assess damaged areas, monitor at-risk zones, and provide assistance to affected residents, as well as address any ongoing dangers that may pose risks to public safety,"" Bangkok City Hall said in a Google-translated statement. In Myanmar — where the ruling military junta has declared a state of emergency — at least 144 people were reported dead and 732 injured, according to Reuters, which cited a Friday evening update on state television. Myanmar's junta chief reportedly said there would be ""many more"" deaths and casualties"" and that routes for international assistance had been opened.

Cracked buildings and bridges in Bangkok were being inspected by engineers for their stability on Friday, though authorities advised that people could return to buildings without severe damage. As the city's notoriously-bad traffic reached severe levels entering Friday evening, with some major highway exits closed, authorities said four main parks would remain open providing water and toilet trucks.

Thai stock exchange closed, offices evacuated

The Stock Exchange of Thailand suspended trading across all exchanges from Friday afternoon from 2:07 p.m. local time, while several Bangkok shopping malls were shuttered for the remainder of Friday and the BTS metro system was closed. Offices across the skyscraper-dense city were meanwhile evacuated on Friday afternoon. Finance worker Bell Satirapraparkul told CNBC she was having lunch in the ground floor restaurant of her office in the Ratchayothin neighborhood in the north of Bangkok when she felt heavy shaking. Employees were barred from the site until Saturday at the earliest without being able to collect their cars. Several tall buildings could be seen swaying severely as water from rooftop pools poured over the side and items were thrown off. Automaker Nissan told CNBC it had paused its manufacturing operations in Thailand until the situation was assessed as safe by Thai authorities. ""Nissan put employees' safety as a priority. As of now, we have confirmed that all employees at Nissan Thailand are safe and evacuated. We are checking if there are damages to our facilities,"" a spokesperson said. Bangkok's hospitals were reported safe and operating as normal. Bangkok's main airport, Suvarnabhumi, issued an update at 8:55 a.m. U.K. time (4:55 a.m. ET) saying operations were continuing as normal. Flight data on Flightradar24 showed aircraft taking off and landing at both Bangkok airports. CNBC has contacted major airlines for updates on their operations. In an advisory, the British Foreign Office said: ""There has been a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, with strong tremors reported across Thailand and some damage reported to buildings in Bangkok. There may be after-shocks. If you're in the area or planning to travel there, follow the advice of the local authorities or your tour operator and monitor local media."" Aviation analytics agency Cirium told CNBC there had been little to no impact on flight operations in either Myanmar or Thailand so far.

Nvidia-backed CoreWeave closes flat at $40 after biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,"Michael Intrator, Founder & CEO of CoreWeave, Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, gestures during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025.

CoreWeave's stock opened at $39 and closed at $40 in its Nasdaq debut on Friday after the company sold shares at $40 a piece, below the expected range.

The seller of artificial intelligence technology in the cloud raised $1.5 billion in its share sale, the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021.

The offering has captured the attention of investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, as CoreWeave represents the first pure-play AI IPO and the largest tech debut in the U.S. in four years. The IPO market has been largely shut since the end of 2021, as the tech industry reckoned with rising inflation and interest rates.

Tech stocks aren't doing CoreWeave any favors. The company hit the market on a day that the Nasdaq was off by almost 3%, heading for its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022. The tech-heavy index is down 10% so far this year.

As a supplier to OpenAI, CoreWeave is among the beneficiaries of the generative AI boom that began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft , which provides cloud services to OpenAI, is CoreWeave's biggest customer, accounting for 62% of the company's $1.92 billion in revenue last year.

CoreWeave rents out access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units to other large tech and AI companies including Meta , IBM and Cohere. Its stiffest competition is coming from the top cloud vendors — Microsoft, Amazon , Google and Oracle .

CoreWeave reported a net loss of $863 million last year, with revenue soaring 737% from a year earlier. It's a capital-intensive business due to the high costs of renting out and operating data centers. CoreWeave has raised almost $13 billion in debt, with much of that allocated for GPUs that go inside the company's leased facilities in the U.S. and abroad.

After initially setting its price target at $47 to $55, with a plan to raise about $2.5 billion at the middle of the range, CoreWeave slimmed down the offering, a reflection of investor skepticism.

""There's a lot of headwinds in the macro,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""And we definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was.""

Few tech companies have debuted on U.S. exchanges in recent years. There were just 13 venture-backed technology IPOs in 2022, 2023 and 2024 combined, compared with 77 in the record year of 2021, according to data from Jay Ritter, an emeritus professor of finance at the University of Florida.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/coreweave-starts-trading-on-nasdaq-at-per-share.html,cnbc
#RecessionIndicator: Young Americans are losing confidence in the economy — and it shows online,"Christina Locopo | CNBC

For economists, harbingers of a recession can include a slowdown in consumer spending and rising unemployment. For the chronically online, indicators can range from the perceived fall of fake eyelashes to more commercials for online colleges. Or, maybe, it's a skin care company selling eggs. And for Sydney Brams, a Miami-based influencer and realtor, it's a decline in prices on clothing resale platform Depop. ""I was literally running to my parents and my boyfriend, and I'm like, 'Look at this. Look, something is very wrong,'"" Brams told CNBC after seeing some Depop sellers ""come back to Earth,"" as she described it. ""I feel like Chicken Little."" Making a joke of so-called recession indicators in everyday life has gained traction in recent weeks as the stock market pullback and weak economic data raised anxiety around the health of the economy. This trend also underscores the uniquely sharp sense of financial dissatisfaction among America's young adults.

Many of today's young adults experienced childhood during the Great Recession and came of age as the pandemic threw everything from in-person work to global supply chains out of orbit. Now, they're concerned about what's been deemed a white-collar job market slowdown and President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again tariff policies — the latter of which has battered financial markets in recent weeks. To be clear, when they share their favorite recession indicators, they're kidding — but they don't see the future path of the U.S. economy as a laughing matter. ""It's gallows humor,"" said James Cohen, a digital culture expert and assistant professor of media studies at Queens College in New York. ""This is very much a coping mechanism."" These omens can be found across popular social media platforms such as X, TikTok and Instagram. Some users see cultural preludes to a recession in, say, Lady Gaga releasing her latest album or the quality of the new season of HBO's ""The White Lotus."" Others chalk up social trends such as learning to play the harmonica or wearing more brown clothing as forewarnings of a financial downturn on the horizon.

Social media users Sydney Michelle (@sydneybmichelle), left; Celeste in DC (@celesteiacevedo), and Sulisa (@ssclosefriendstory) share their personal ""recession indicators"" on TikTok. Courtesy: Sydney Michelle | Celeste in DC | Sulisa | via TikTok

Just last week, several social media users saw a slam-dunk opportunity to employ variations of the joke when DoorDash announced a partnership with Klarna for users to finance food delivery orders. A spokesperson for Klarna acknowledged to NBC News that people needing to pay for meals on credit is ""a bad indicator for society."" Some content creators have made the humor an entry point to share budget-friendly alternatives for everyday luxuries that may have to go if wallets are stretched. ""We are heading into a recession. You need to learn how to do your nails at home,"" TikTok user Celeste in DC (@celesteiacevedo) said in a video explaining how to use press-on nail kits as opposed to splurging at a salon.

Declining confidence

These jokes don't exist in a vacuum. Closely followed data illustrates how this trend reflects a growing malaise among young people when it comes to the economy. At the start of 2024, 18-to-34-year-olds had the highest consumer sentiment reading of any age group tracked by the University of Michigan. The index of this group's attitude toward the economy has since declined more than 6%, despite the other age cohorts' ticking higher.

This switch is particularly notable given that young people have historically had stronger readings than their older counterparts, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at Michigan. A typically cheerier outlook can be explained by younger people being less likely to have additional financial responsibilities, such as children, Hsu said. But she added that this age bracket is likely grappling with rising housing costs and debt right now, while also feeling uncertainty tied to economic policy under the new White House. ""I have a suspicion that young people are starting to feel like — or have been feeling like — many markers of the American dream are much more difficult to reach now,"" Hsu said. Young people are also less likely to have assets such as property or investments that can buoy financial spirits when the economy flashes warning signs, according to Camelia Kuhnen, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina. The potential for a recession, which is broadly defined as at least two consecutive quarters of the national economy contracting, has been on the minds of both Wall Street and Main Street. A Deutsche Bank survey conducted March 17-20 found the average global market strategist saw a nearly 43% chance of a recession over the next 12 months. An index of consumer expectations for the future released Tuesday by the Conference Board slid to its lowest level in 12 years, falling well below the threshold that signals a recession ahead. Meanwhile, Google searches during a period in March for the word ""recession"" hit highs not seen since 2022. This onslaught of news comes after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on March 16 that there were ""no guarantees"" the U.S. would avoid a recession. Bessent said a ""detox"" period is needed for the national economy, which he and other Trump administration officials have argued is too reliant on government spending.

"U.S. health department plans to slash 10,000 jobs as RFK Jr. upends agencies","Robert F. Kennedy Jr., US secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, March 24, 2025.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments, as he works to reshape the nation's federal health agencies, the department said Thursday.

Those job cuts are in addition to about 10,000 employees who opted to leave HHS since President Donald Trump took office, through voluntary separation offers. Combined, they will lead to the federal health department shedding about a quarter of its workforce, shrinking it to 62,000 employees.

HHS is a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness and food and tobacco products. The department also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act's markets.

The department will cut jobs at divisions responsible for offering insurance to the poorest Americans, approving new drugs, and responding to disease outbreaks, according to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the cuts.

The major restructuring comes as the U.S. grapples with one of the worst measles outbreaks in more than two decades, and as bird flu spreads in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases.

HHS will also drop five of its 10 regional offices, but it said essential health services won't be affected.

""We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,"" Kennedy said. ""This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.""

The department said the cuts will save the government about $1.8 billion per year. The federal government spent roughly $6.8 trillion in fiscal 2024.

Here are the employees the Trump administration plans to cut, according to the Journal:

3,500 full-time employees from the Food and Drug Administration, or about 19% of its workforce

2,400 workers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or roughly 18% of its staff

1,200 employees from the National Institutes of Health, or about 6% of its workforce

300 workers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or roughly 4% of its employees

As part of the restructuring, Kennedy is consolidating the department's 28 current divisions into 15 new ones, which HHS said will ""centralize core functions"" such as human resources, information technology, procurement, external affairs and policy.

Among them is a new subdivision called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine offices in HHS that address addiction, toxic substances, mental health and occupational safety, among others, into one central office. That includes the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/rfk-jr-plans-10000-hhs-job-cuts.html,cnbc
"Trump was supposed to unlock IPO market, but CoreWeave debut reflects ongoing skepticism","CoreWeave Inc. signage during the company's initial public offering at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Friday, March 28, 2025.

It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

The Trump presidency was set to usher in a rush of money to the markets, spurred by a new era of deregulation and lower taxes that would lead high-valued tech companies off the sidelines and onto public exchanges after a four-year lull in initial public offerings.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in January that he sensed a ""more constructive kind of optimism"" and that the IPO market is ""going to pick up.""

But a little over two months into President Donald Trump's second White House term, the first test case has been a flop.

After downsizing its IPO late Thursday and pricing below its expected range, CoreWeave was unchanged in its market debut on Friday, closing at $40 and leaving the company with a market cap that's right around where the company was valued by private investors a year ago.

The debut coincided with a 2.7% drop in the Nasdaq on Friday, a decline that put the tech-heavy index down more than 10% in 2025 and on pace ofr its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022.

Macro concerns are being driven by President Trump's tariffs on America's top trading partners and dramatic government cost cuts, moves that are combining to simultaneously raise prices and lift unemployment. The deterioration in consumer sentiment was even worse than anticipated in March as worries over inflation intensified, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

That all created a tough backdrop for CoreWeave to try and crack open the IPO market, particularly given concerns swirling around the company and its valuation. CoreWeave is one of the leading suppliers of Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, for artificial intelligence training and workloads. Demand has been so hot that CoreWeave's revenue soared more than 700% last year to almost $2 billion.

However, CoreWeave counts on Microsoft for over 60% of sales and recorded a net loss of $863 million last year, due to the hefty costs of GPUs and the expenses associated with leasing and operating data centers. As of Dec. 31, the company had $8 billion in debt.

""It's a bit disappointing that the price was dropped so significantly at the open,"" Joe Medved, a partner at Lerer Hippeau, told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Friday.

CoreWeave CEO says lower IPO pricing was 'where the buying interest was',"CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator said Friday that the company's IPO pricing, which came in below expectations, has to be placed in the larger context of the macroenvironment.

""There's a lot of headwinds in the macro,"" Intrator said on CNBC's Squawk Box. ""And we definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was.""

The company, which provides access to Nvidia graphics processing units for artificial intelligence training and workloads, priced its IPO at $40 a share, below the initial $47 to $55 per share filing. The stock will begin trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""CRWV.""

The lower price provided enough of a discount to the replacement value that investors could feel comfortable buying, sources familiar with the offering told CNBC's Leslie Picker. Replacement value is the value of the company's assets at the present time.

About 10-15 long-only and strategic investors made up the majority of the backing group, the sources said.

Elon Musk says xAI has acquired X in deal that values social media site at $33 billion,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk boards Air Force One with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) as they departs for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, New Jersey, U.S., March 22, 2025.

Elon Musk said on Friday that his startup xAI has merged with X, his social network, in an all-stock transaction that values the artificial intelligence company at $80 billion and the social media company at $33 billion.

""xAI and X's futures are intertwined,"" Musk, the world's richest person, wrote in a post on X. ""Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.""

He added that the merger would, ""unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.""

Because both companies are privately held and controlled by Musk, the transaction likely amounts to a stock swap, with X investors getting paid out in xAI shares. The companies have a number of mutual investors, including venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as Fidelity Management, Vy Capital and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Co.

Musk, who's also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, acquired Twitter in a deal valued at around $44 billion in late 2022, implementing massive cost cuts and soon renaming it X. Linda Yaccarino, who Musk hired as CEO of X, wrote in a post after Friday's announcement, ""The future could not be brighter.""

Musk launched xAI less than two years ago with a stated goal to ""understand the true nature of the universe."" The startup has been trying to compete directly with OpenAI, the richly valued AI startup that Musk co-founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab. He later left OpenAI and has recently been involved in a public relations and legal spat with the company and CEO Sam Altman over the direction that it's taken.

At xAI, Musk's team has been developing large language models and AI software products, taking on offerings from OpenAI as well as Google , Microsoft , Meta and others. X and xAI have already been intertwined, with xAI's Grok chatbot available to users of the social media app.

In June, xAI announced it would build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, to train Grok. And in September, Musk revealed part of the Memphis supercomputer, now known as Colossus, was already online.

Environmental and public health advocates have raised concerns about the breakneck speed of development in Memphis, citing a lack of community input and oversight. The facility is powered by natural gas burning turbines and xAI plans to expand and build a graywater treatment plant nearby as well.

Investors valued xAI at around $50 billion in a financing round last year. Bloomberg reported last month that the company was in talks to raise funds at a $75 billion valuation. OpenAI was closed to wrapping up a round in February at a $260 billion, while generative AI startup Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a deal that closed this month.

In addition to running Tesla, SpaceX and xAI and overseeing X, Musk has spent much of his time this year in Washington, D.C., as a central figure in President Donald Trump's second administration.

After contributing $270 million to help Trump and other Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 campaign, Musk was put in charge of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is eliminating government expenses and getting rid of regulations. It's a position that puts Musk in position to make changes in ways that benefit his various businesses.

This isn't the first time Musk has merged two of his entities.

In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2.6 billion. The solar installer was founded by his first cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, and funded by Musk, who served as board chair. Tesla shareholders later sued, alleging the deal amounted to a SolarCity bailout, and a breach of fiduciary duty that enriched Musk personally. Delaware judges who heard the dispute decided in favor of Musk and Tesla, and allowed the deal to stand without any remuneration back to the automaker.

Trump commutes sentences of Ozy Media founder Carlos Watson and company,"Carlos Watson, co-founder of Ozy Media, speaks with press after his sentencing hearing at Brooklyn Federal Court on December 16, 2024 in New York City.

President Donald Trump commuted the criminal sentence of Ozy Media founder Carlos Watson on Friday, just hours before Watson was due to begin serving a 116-month prison term for a multi-million-dollar scheme that included falsely claiming the start-up had deals with Google and Oprah Winfrey, a senior White House official said.

Watson had expected to surrender Friday afternoon to the Federal Correctional Institution in Lompoc, California before he received word of Trump granting him executive clemency, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Trump also commuted the sentence of one year of probation imposed on Ozy Media for the defunct news and entertainment company's conviction in the same case.

Trump's actions remove the criminal penalty imposed on Watson and Ozy.

Watson was convicted at trial in Brooklyn federal court last July of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

The 55-year-old former Ozy CEO was sentenced in December.

In February, a federal judge ordered Watson and Ozy to pay almost $60 million in forfeiture and more than $36 million in restitution.

"Judge orders CFPB to reinstate fired employees, preserve records and get back to work","FILE PHOTO: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Acting Director Russell Vought testifies before House Budget Committee on 2020 Budget on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 12, 2019.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's leadership, appointed by President Donald Trump, to halt its campaign to dismantle the agency.

In a filing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with the CFPB employee union that sued acting director Russell Vought last month to prevent him from laying off nearly all the regulator's staff. Operatives from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have also been involved in efforts to fire employees.

""Defendants shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the individual employee's performance or conduct; and defendants shall not issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee,"" Berman said.

The order is the latest example in which a federal judge has pushed back against moves by the Trump administration to lay off federal employees and hobble disfavored agencies. It breathes new life into the only federal agency tasked specifically with consumer protection of nonbank financial players, but one that the industry has accused of operating outside its authority under former director Rohit Chopra.

Berman ordered Vought to reinstate all probationary and term employees fired after Vought took over at the CFPB, said that he shouldn't ""delete, destroy, remove, or impair agency data,"" and struck down Vought's February stop-work order.

""To ensure that employees can perform their statutorily mandated functions, the defendants must provide them with either fully-equipped office space, or permission to work remotely"" Berman wrote.

In the sweeping document, Berman also said that the CFPB needed to ensure its consumer complaint portal worked and it responded to those complaints; told the CFPB to reverse contract terminations undertaken by Vought, and ordered him to file a report by April 4 confirming compliance with the edicts.

She specifically said the order applied to all CFPB leaders as well as ""any other persons who are in active concert or participation with them, such as personnel from the Department of Government Efficiency.""

"Forget the April 2 tariff announcement and watch this date instead, BofA's Hartnett says","With investors honing in on President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement as a pivotal date, they also might want to give some thought to what happens two days later. In fact, April 4, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces the March nonfarm payrolls number, could be a more pivotal day in the view of Michael Hartnett, Bank of America's chief investment strategist. Harntett contends that the Trump ""Liberation Day"" announcement — when countries will face additional tariffs — might get soft-pedaled as the president wants to avoid another wave of inflation.

"Dollar General is a buy as consumers move to trade down, says this strategist","Dollar General stock could perform well if the economy increasingly weakens, according to Lido Advisors chief market strategist Gina Sanchez. Sanchez expects economic growth to slow down in the second-half of 2025, over a combination of tariff and inflation worries. Still, Sanchez said she's holding onto athleisure stock Lululemon as well as shares of cloud computing technology provider Oracle . Here's a closer look at what she had to say on CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Friday. Dollar General Stock in discount retailer Dollar General has gained more than 13% in 2025 and almost 16% in the past month alone. This week, Dollar General announced plans to sell its Family Dollar division for $1 billion. Sanchez favors the the discount retailer and says despite some headwinds including store remodeling and labor costs, there is potential for shares to gain further as consumers opt to trade down in an attempt to find more value. ""If you look at sort of where the consumer is and where they're going, stocks like this tend to perform,"" she said. ""We think that they're moving in the right direction and this is cheap.

Startup founder Charlie Javice found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase in $175 million deal,"Charlie Javice, who is charged with defrauding JPMorgan Chase & Co into buying her now-shuttered college financial aid startup Frank for $175 million in 2021, arrives at United States Court in Manhattan in New York City, June 6, 2023.

Charlie Javice, founder of a startup purchased by JPMorgan Chase in 2021, was convicted in federal court Friday of defrauding the bank by vastly overstating the company's customer list.

The jury decision comes after weeks of testimony in New York over who was to blame for the flameout of a once-promising startup. Frank, founded by Javice in 2016, aimed to help users apply for college financial aid.

JPMorgan has accused Javice, 32, of duping the bank into paying $175 million for a company that had more than 4 million customers, when in reality it had fewer than 300,000.

The largest U.S. bank by assets sued Javice in late 2022 after attempting to send marketing emails to some of the thousands of ""customers"" it thought Frank had. In its suit, JPMorgan released emails in which Javice hired a data scientist to generate a fake roster of customers.

Then, in April 2023, the Justice Department charged Javice with four crimes including wire and bank fraud, counts which carry multi-decade maximum sentences. Javice was arrested at Newark Airport on April 3 of that year and had been out on bail.

Javice had pleaded not guilty and said she was innocent throughout the trial; her lawyers blamed JPMorgan for rushing to close the Frank acquisition because it feared that other suitors would emerge.

Sentencing will happen in August, CNBC's Leslie Picker reported.

A spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan declined to comment on Friday, while the office of a lawyer representing Javice didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/charlie-javice-found-guilty-jpmorgan-chase.html,cnbc
FCC says it's investigating Disney and ABC over DEI efforts,"The main gate at The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, on Sept. 25, 2023.

The Federal Communications Commission has alerted the Walt Disney Company and its ABC unit that it will begin an investigation into the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at the media giant.

The FCC, the agency that regulates the media and telecommunications industry, said in a letter dated Friday that it wants to ""ensure that Disney and ABC have not been violating FCC equal employment opportunity regulations by promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.""

""We are reviewing the Federal Communications Commission's letter, and we look forward to engaging with the commission to answer its questions,"" a Disney spokesperson told CNBC.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who was recently appointed by President Donald Trump, began a similar investigation into Comcast and NBCUniversal in early February. The inquiry comes after Trump signed an executive order looking to end DEI practices at U.S. corporations in January. The order calls for each federal agency to ""identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations"" among publicly traded companies, as well as nonprofits and other institutions.

""For decades, Disney focused on churning out box office and programming successes,"" Carr wrote in the letter to CEO Bob Iger. ""But then something changed. Disney has now been embroiled in rounds of controversy surrounding its DEI policies.""

Intel announces three board members will retire following CEO shake-up,"A sign is posted in front of Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on Aug. 1, 2024.

Three members of Intel's board of directors will not stand for reelection in May, the company said in a filing on Thursday.

Omar Ishrak, former CEO of Medtronic ; Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a doctor and philanthropist; and Tsu-Jae King Liu, the dean of the college of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, will retire from the board at Intel's annual meeting in May.

Intel has nominated 11 directors, who all currently serve on the board, including new CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

The shake-up comes after Intel named Tan to lead the struggling chipmaker earlier this month, replacing Pat Gelsinger, who left the company in December.

What the biggest tech IPO in years signals for investment banks like Goldman Sachs,"CoreWeave was one of the most highly-anticipated initial public offerings of the year. In fact, it was the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021. The cloud services provider – which has navigated a challenging path to its IPO – is being viewed as a barometer of future Wall Street dealmaking and the investment banks that profit from them. The news CoreWeave shares opened at $39 each early Friday afternoon — debuting short of their offer price. The stock sank further before rallying in late afternoon trading. The New Jersey-based company, which provides big tech customers access to Nvidia chips for AI training and workloads, priced a scaled-back 37.5 million shares at $40 each Thursday evening — below the initial expected range of between $47 and $55. Still, CoreWeave managed to raise $1.5 billion. Based on Friday's trading, its market capitalization was more than $19 billion. In response to the size and pricing adjustments, CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator cited ""headwinds in the macro"" environment. During an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning, Intrator said the company ""definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was."" He added, ""We believe that as the public markets get to know us, get to know how we execute, get to know how we build our infrastructure, get to know how we build our client relationships and the incredible capacity of our solutions, the company will be very successful."" Big picture The CoreWeave IPO comes as Wall Street's largest financial firms are banking on a pickup in deals following years of muted public offerings and mergers due to high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. The market expected deal activity to pick up — and for investment banks, like Club name Goldman Sachs , to see fatter fees — after Donald Trump won the presidential election on promises of robust economic growth and deregulation. The deals and proceeds have increased in 2025, but not as much as hoped due to the stock market's recent volatility. In the first quarter, according to IPO-tracker Renaissance Capital, 44 offerings have raised a combined $9.4 billion. That's up from 30 IPOs and a combined $7.8 billion raised in the year-ago period. ""A strong start was cut off by a market correction near quarter-end,"" Renaissance Capital said in a report this week. Trump's near-daily tariff headlines are increasing concerns of a recession and an all-out global trade war. That's made companies want to conserve capital and stay on the sidelines when it comes to new deals. Case in point: Jefferies posted lackluster first-quarter earnings results Wednesday as profits declined on investment banking weakness. Jefferies CEO Rich Handler said, ""Capital markets have become increasingly more challenging due to the uncertainties that have arisen around U.S. policy and geopolitical events."" There are still reasons to be optimistic, though. Online lender Klarna and physical therapy company Hinge Health have both filed prospectuses shortly after CoreWeave did. There have also been recent reports that the popular chat app Discord tapped Goldman Sachs and other large banks for a planned IPO as well, according to Bloomberg. Goldman, along with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan , were the lead underwriters of the CoreWeave offering. GS YTD mountain Goldman Sachs (GS) year-to-date performance Bottom line There's no doubt about it: CoreWeave's public debut will send a signal to investors about the outlook for the IPO market. ""This was the one that's supposed to open the floodgates [for deals],"" Jim Cramer said Friday. More deals are essential in our investment case for Goldman – which we bought more of last week. We initiated a position in the Wall Street behemoth last year on the premise that it's the best pure-play for an investment banking rebound. CoreWeave is ""certainly going to be a test. Not only for demand for AI stocks but also the IPO market at large,"" Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis, said Friday. ""That's crucial for Goldman."" We recognize that the IB resurgence hasn't materialized yet in 2025. But we're not giving up hope on Goldman ahead of its quarterly earnings next month. Trading volumes have been strong, given the stock market's recent volatility, which could offset some IB revenue weakness. Plus, it seems like uncertainty around dealmaking has been priced into Goldman's stock already. Shares are down 19% from record highs last month. The stock was also 5% lower year-to-date, in line with the S & P 500's dismal performance. Getting past April 2 –the looming deadline for Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs – will be helpful for Goldman's IB business as well. ""There should be more clarity after April 2,"" Marks said.

"These dividend stocks will benefit from longevity's 'transformational' opportunity, UBS says","The aging population will be a tailwind for the stock market — and two dividend stocks are expected to benefit, according to UBS. Longevity is one of three ""transformational innovation opportunities"" that will drive equity markets in the next decade, a team of strategists said in a note Wednesday. The other two are artificial intelligence and power and resources. ""The combination of ever-increasing lifespans and a demographic shift toward an older population creates a range of investment opportunities,"" the UBS strategists wrote. One area that is already established in the space is retirement living, which is growing at a 4% compound annual growth rate until 2030, they said. The oldest baby boomers are rapidly approaching their 80th birthday and that is going to increase demand for senior housing options, such as independent living, assisted living and nursing homes. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care predicts that 200,000 additional senior housing units will be needed in 2025, an additional 500,000 units by 2028 and another 775,000 units by 2030. Senior housing stocks UBS sees two real estate investment trusts that will benefit from the trend, and they pay solid dividends. Ventas , whose portfolio includes senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities and medical office buildings, has a 2.8% dividend yield. Analyst Jonathan Woloshin likes the diversity in its real estate holdings and geographic locations. Ventas has 1,400 properties across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. VTR YTD mountain Ventas The ongoing recovery in senior housing, which took a hit during the Covid pandemic, has led to an uptick in Ventas' senior housing occupancy levels, he pointed out. New senior housing supply is now at its lowest level since the first quarter of 2013, he noted. ""The increase in occupancy is leading to stronger pricing power and margin improvement,"" Woloshin said. In addition, the inconsistent management execution seen in recent quarters has abated and ventas' shares are closing the valuation gap with the company's largest peer, he added. Shares are up about 16% year to date. Welltower also has a diversified portfolio. The company boasts more than 1,500 senior housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. It pays a dividend yield of about 1.8%. ""WELL has a strong senior housing portfolio located in a number of high-barrier-to-entry markets, something that continues to benefit the company in a post- COVID-19 world,"" UBS analyst Thomas Parmentier wrote. ""In addition, senior housing occupancy gains have bolstered WELL's stock price."" WELL YTD mountain Welltower The stock, which is up 21% so far this year, is trading at a ""significant premium valuation"" to its peers, he pointed out. However, he thinks a premium is justified given Welltower's strong operational performance and growth. ""WELL is in solid financial shape, in our view, with an investment-grade balance sheet, a good management team, manageable debt maturities, and solid access to liquidity,"" Parmentier said.

Dwyer, who received a sentence of 18 months of probation, agreed to pay $150,000 in fines.

The founders received criminal sentences of probation of varying lengths and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes , Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed , and former head of business development Gregory Dwyer, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.

President Donald Trump granted pardons to three co-founders of the BitMEX global cryptocurrency exchange, as well as to a former high-ranking employee of the company, CNBC has learned.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a ""money laundering platform"" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was ""a sham.""

Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.

Hayes, in a tweet on Friday, wrote, ""Thank you POTUS,"" using the term for ""President of the United States.""

Delo, in a statement, said, ""The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders.""

""This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,"" Delo said.

""As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals.""

""I'm sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders,"" Delo said. ""A legal wrong has been righted today and despite the distress I have been through over the past few years I'm pleased to have cleared my name and to be able to continue my life and philanthropic work without the burden of an unfounded conviction.""

Hayes, Delo and Reed founded BitMEX in 2014. Prosecutors said the executives knew that the exchange was required to implement an anti-money laundering plan because it served U.S. customers ""but chose to flout those requirements, requiring only that customers provide an email address to use BitMEX's services.""

""Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX's trading platform through at least in or about 2018, and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX's bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws,"" the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement in January.

Delo, the former chief operating officer and chief strategy officer of BitMEX, had been sentenced to 30 months of probation after his guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Hayes was sentenced to six months of home confinement, followed by two years of probation.

Reed, who is the exchange's former chief technology officer, was sentenced to 18 months of probation.

Trevor Milton, the founder and former CEO of electric truck maker Nikola, revealed Thursday night that Trump had pardoned him for his criminal conviction for securities fraud. Milton had been sentenced to four years in prison in that case, but remained free on appeal.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/trump-pardon-bitmex-crypto-exchange-money-laundering.html,cnbc
Stocks are closing out the week on a sour note after a double dose of bad news,"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market update: Stocks are closing out the week on an ugly note. The market got a double dose of bad economic news earlier after the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the PCE price index — remained stubbornly elevated while University of Michigan consumer sentiment continued to slide. Also, a lack of enthusiasm for CoreWeave , the largest tech IPO since 2021, may have added to the market's angst about AI-related stocks. Shares of this AI cloud services provider opened $1 below its IPO price of $40 but that's terrible when you consider the Nasdaq is off nearly 3% in the session. This and that: Bloomberg reported Friday that the Panama Canal ports sale from CK Hutchison to a BlackRock-led consortium could be delayed past the expected completed date of April 2. Political reasons may be getting in the way, after China criticized the deal and CK's senior advisor Li Ka-shing. It's something to monitor in the weeks ahead. Following Friday's economic data and market uneasiness over tariffs, the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's June Meeting increased to about 76% from 66% the day before, according to CME Fed Watch. Up next: The market's focus next week will be on tariffs and economic data. On Wednesday, the Trump Administration is expected to impose reciprocal tariffs against countries that have a trade imbalance with the United States. There's still a lot of uncertainty about the size and scope of these tariffs and which, if any, industries will be exempted. The market could benefit by gaining some clarity on tariffs, but the uncertain impact they have on the economy and inflation remains a significant overhang. On the data side, it's job week which means on Friday we'll see the March nonfarm payroll report. The current expectation is that the economy added 140,000 jobs in the month with an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.1%. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., March 27, 2025. Brendan McDermid | Reuters",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/stocks-are-closing-out-week-on-a-sour-note-after-double-dose-of-bad-news.html,cnbc
Investors limp into next week's 'Liberation Day' hoping for clarity on U.S. tariffs,"Wall Street is bracing for ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, when investors are hoping that any clarity around President Donald Trump's tariffs will finally give an agitated market a path forward. The stock market has been on a wild ride in 2025, as a ream of policy changes from the White House has left investors confused as to what to buy or sell. By the end of trading on Monday, when the quarter ends, the S & P 500 will have managed to dip into correction territory — just 22 days after reaching all-time highs — before recouping some of its losses. The broader market index was last more than 9% off its peak and posted its fifth weekly decline in six weeks. Market observers expect that any sort of finality that comes April 2 will give the stock market enough of the certainty it needs for a short-term boost. That said, many worry there will be no forthcoming resolution. What's more, they fear the severity of tariffs, as well as any of the economic repercussions, could remain a long-term overhang for equities. ""If you don't get much more tariff actions, and there's some resolution of uncertainty, you could see a bit of a temporary relief rally,"" said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ""But I think that there's going to be selling into it, because unless you're backing down from tariffs, this is a negative, no matter what."" The stakes are heightened as tariffs are just one piece of a larger economic picture that is becoming more grim as of late, especially with the federal budget deadline also looming next month. While household balance sheets remain strong, weakening consumer sentiment has investors fearful the U.S. is headed for a slowdown, at a minimum, and a recession, at worst. ""The probability of a recession almost certainly has gone up,"" said Chris Marangi, co-CIO of value at Gabelli Funds. ""I'm not sure that's been fully reflected yet in prices."" How severe will tariffs be? Perhaps most important for investors will be what results of the tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, which have raised eyebrows as the USMCA trade agreement between the three major trading partners was brokered during the first Trump administration. A diminishing of trade relations would have far-reaching consequences for all three countries and add to fears that the current Trump administration sees tariffs more as a revenue-raising tool than one to negotiate a better deal. ""My worst fear would be that there is no intention to renegotiate the USMCA, or to improve it,"" Deutsche Bank Securities' Ryan said. ""The worst fear is that their intention is actually to have no more USMCA."" The severity of the tariffs could also determine the outlook for both the economy and the market. The Tax Foundation estimates the average tariff rate for all imports will rise to 8.4% in 2025, from 2.5% in 2024. That would be the highest average rate going back to 1946. Ryan expects the current tariff rate is higher, at 10.5%, and thinks it could go over 16% if the Trump administration takes a maximalist approach to trade. That would bring the tariff rate close to Depression-era levels, he said, to 1938. That could further weaken the growth outlook, and raise inflation expectations, at a time when fears of stagflation are percolating on Wall Street. ""All of this is negative, okay?"" said Ryan. ""None of this is positive."" More fear than greed The on-again-off-again nature of recent tariff announcements is important in part because neither consumers nor corporations can plan for the future. Neither can investors. Some on the Street such as Fundstrat's Tom Lee think stocks can stage a comeback rally following April 2, with the Magnificent Seven stocks possibly resuming their former leadership. Last week, 3Fourteen's Warren Pies said it may be worthwhile for investors who have an underweight equity exposure to bring it up to equal weight, to start taking an "" offensive mindset "" in April. But plenty of others are positioning themselves defensively ahead of the announcement. Fixed income is becoming more attractive, along with gold and other alternative assets. By itself, gold has soared past $3,000 an ounce, on Friday notching its 18th record high of 2025 amid concerns of a global trade war. Meanwhile, confidence in the bull case for U.S. equities is taking a hit . This week, an online survey conducted by Allianz Life Insurance found that 51% of respondents ""worry that another big market crash is on the horizon,"" up from 46% previously. On Friday, Bank of America Securities' Savita Subramanian said ""new US equity bear cases [are] emerging,"" citing, among other things, ""policy uncertainty amid higher government debt."" Among big firms, Barclays' strategist Venu Krishna is the latest to cut his 2025 S & P 500 target to 5,900 from 6,600 , meaning little to no upside from where the benchmark started the year. His is also the lowest outlook among those in a CNBC Pro market strategist survey. Gabelli Funds' Marangi outlined the criteria for finding buying opportunities in this environment: ""We're obviously trying to gauge how aggressive to be in deploying capital, and trying to find companies that are relatively immune to what may be going on, or trying to find companies that maybe have overreacted to some of the news that comes out of Washington."" Elsewhere, at a recent media roundtable, Connor Fitzgerald, fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management, put it succinctly when he was asked to take a view on equities: ""Yeah. I don't love stocks right now."" Week ahead calendar All times ET.

Mark Cuban: Don't rely on ChatGPT to do all your work for you—'AI is never the answer; AI is the tool',"Artificial intelligence is the most essential tool young people need to be successful, says billionaire investor Mark Cuban — but don't expect it to do your work for you.

The technology works best when you already have the experience necessary to fact-check or add quality control to AI results. If you expect AI to master a skill like writing or video editing for you overnight, you'll fall behind your competition, Cuban said at a SXSW panel announcing the partnership between ABC's ""Shark Tank"" and payment processing platform Clover.

""AI is never the answer; AI is the tool,"" Cuban said. While AI can write scripts and edit videos, it can't discern what is a good or bad story, he noted, so ""you need to be creative. Whatever skills you have, AI can amplify them.""

The new recipe for professional success is starting with your pre-existing skills, talents, and experiences, and then using AI to hone your work and make some of your processes faster, Cuban said.

You ignore AI at your own peril, Cuban added: Your use of the technology ""could be the difference between [your competition] getting ahead of you or not.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/mark-cuban-dont-rely-on-chatgpt-to-do-all-your-work.html,cnbc
Wedbush says Texas Roadhouse is owning casual dining. Here's where we would buy more,"Wedbush analysts said Texas Roadhouse is the ""primary transaction share gainer"" in casual dining right now and raised its price target on shares. The news Wedbush increased estimates for the company's first and second quarter same-store sales growth, citing a boost in dining out thanks to better weather. A more seasoned staff and faster turnarounds for tables are other factors improving Texas Roadhouse's operations, analysts said, and also raised their full-year projections. On the flip side of this, Wedbush stayed a bit conservative on 2025 margin estimates. Though Wedbush says they aren't seeing much risk to 3-4% commodity inflation and 4-5% labor inflation guidance, they factored in commodity inflation above the midpoint of guidance. Wedbush analysts anticipate additional potential share buybacks from Texas Roadhouse management following a $500 million authorization late February. The company has a historical track record of aggressively buying back the stock when share prices are down, analysts said. The firm raised the restaurant's target price ten bucks to $210 from $200, and maintained its outperform rating. Big picture Wedbush's read on Texas Roadhouse parallels the positive outlook that Darden Restaurants shared for the casual dining industry in a post-earnings call last week. As with Texas Roadhouse, Darden executives attributed top of year weakness within its chains to poor weather, but said spring would be the start of a comeback season for the industry. Texas Roadhouse has not yet released any data on its progress in March. But analysts see positive signs for a chain that carries a reputation of providing quality food at a good value to consumers, a winning formula in uncertain times. Analysts at Bank of America met with Texas Roadhouse executive management earlier this month, and they reiterated ""weather-driven changes in consumer behavior"" but said ""there are no signs of worsening sentiment."" The company is prioritizing the maintenance of excellent restaurant operations and maximizing profits, Bank of America analysts noted. Bottom Line The Investing Club is aligned with Wedbush's note as we agree that inclement weather played a significant role in the softness in January and February. Although consumers don't enjoy dining out in bad weather, the underlying health of the company was strong as demonstrated in their fourth-quarter earnings, said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. Jim Cramer is bullish on Texas Roadhouse, saying that the news from Wedbush was terrific for the company during Friday's morning meeting. Initially, Jim was concerned that Texas Roadhouse's same store sales would remain subdued following a difficult start this year but said it turns out that he was wrong. The stock is trading down 4% year to date, less hard hit than many of its industry peers, said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. We last purchased additional shares of Texas Roadhouse twice earlier in March at $176 and $178. We would absolutely buy more shares of the stock if it dips below $170.

"Late student loan bills can drop credit scores by up to 171 points, Federal Reserve warns","A student works in the library on the campus of American University in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 20, 2025.

The more than 9 million student loan borrowers who are estimated to be late on their payments could experience ""significant drops"" in their credit scores during the first half of 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warns.

Some people with a student loan delinquency could see their scores fall by as much as 171 points, the Fed writes in a March 26 report. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.

The expected drop was highest for borrowers who start with the best scores. Among those with scores under 620, the reported new delinquency could lead to an average 87-point decline.

""Although some of these borrowers may be able to cure their delinquencies,"" the Fed writes, ""the damage to their credit standing will have already been done and will remain on their credit reports for seven years.""

It's been a long time since federal student loan borrowers have needed to worry about the consequences of missed payments, which can also include the garnishment of wages and retirement benefits. That's because collection activity was suspended during the pandemic and for a while after. That relief period officially expired on Sept. 30, 2024.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/late-student-loan-bills-can-drop-credit-scores-by-171-points-fed-reports.html,cnbc
Amazon MGM Studios boss Jen Salke to step down. Read the internal memo,"Jen Salke, the head of Amazon MGM Studios is stepping down from her role, the company confirmed.

Mike Hopkins, Amazon's head of Prime Video and MGM Studios, made the announcement in a Thursday memo to employees. Salke is exiting Amazon to move into film production, and her previous position will not be replaced, Hopkins said.

""We've decided to flatten our leadership structure a bit and not fill the head of studios role,"" Hopkins wrote. ""In line with Amazon's recent work to streamline reporting lines and accelerate decision making, we felt this was the best direction for our studio, which will now operate as distinct film and television studios.""

As part of her exit, Salke signed a first-look film and TV producing deal with Amazon, Hopkins wrote.

""As I've been considering my next chapter, I've always been searching for that moment where I was positive that our work had set up Amazon MGM Studios for even more success in the long term,"" Salke said in a statement provided by Amazon. ""When I look at the teams we've put in place, our amazing leaders, and the incredible slate of films and shows we've got in the pipeline, I realized now is that moment.""

Amazon tapped Salke in 2018 to head up the Studios business after the ouster of her predecessor Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.

The company's foray into original TV series and films was primarily marked by niche and prestige content like ""Transparent,"" ""Manchester By the Sea"" and ""The Man in the High Castle."" Under Salke's leadership, Amazon became a bigger player in the entertainment industry.

Salke spearheaded projects that earned Amazon Studios recognition, such as ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" ""Reacher"" and ""Fallout."" The company also took on ""The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power"" during her tenure, which became the most expensive TV show ever made.

Amazon acquired motion picture studio MGM Studios for $8.45 billion in 2021, giving it access to a deep bench of intellectual property, including the James Bond catalog. Amazon gained creative control over the Bond movie franchise from the Broccoli family last month.

Below is Hopkins' full memo, which CNBC obtained.

Dear Team, Since joining Amazon in 2018, Jen Salke has been a driving force in Amazon MGM Studios' evolution into what it is today: a world-class producer of award-winning films and series viewed by hundreds of millions of our customers around the world. Original films and series served as the foundation of Prime Video's growth into one of the world's leading entertainment destinations, and Jen's leadership is an undisputed driver of the success we've had in this space over the years. Having accomplished so much as an executive, Jen has decided that her next challenge and chapter will be on the production side, with the aim of getting even closer to the global creative community -- which she's been such a vital member of over the course of her career. As a result, Jen will step down from her role as Head of Amazon MGM Studios in order to start a new production entity, and we're so pleased that she'll continue to make her home right here on our lot via an overall first-look deal across both film and TV. In Jen's words: ""Since I joined in 2018, we set out together to create a new type of global studio that fostered an environment for the world's most creative talent to do their very best work. Along the way, we expanded internationally, built out a film business and hired and developed an incredible team. As I've been considering my next chapter, I've always been searching for that moment where I was positive that our work had set up Amazon MGM Studios for even more success in the long term. When I look at the teams we've put in place, our amazing leaders, and the incredible slate of films and shows we've got in the pipeline, I realized now is that moment. I'm looking forward to continuing doing what I love, cultivating talent, supporting their vision, and bringing compelling stories to audiences around the world."" I can't say enough to express my thanks to Jen for her partnership. Starting with my personal Day 1 in 2020, her vision, creativity and industry relationships were (and are) so apparent that I had no doubt our work together could be transformative not only to Amazon, but also to the industry as a whole. The Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, Red One, Maxton Hall, The Idea of You, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Saltburn, Road House, Beast Games, Culpa Mia/Tuya and others speak to the hits under her leadership that have stirred cultural conversation and delivered incredible storytelling to worldwide audiences…and that list covers only the past 18 months. In addition, her leadership is evidenced by the senior team she's hired and developed…a team that I know will step up in a big way going forward. Speaking of that team, we will be taking a couple of weeks to have thoughtful conversations with Jen's directs and others to finalize the ideal long-term structure for the Amazon MGM Studios organization as a whole, and we'll have more to share on that work soon. One thing I did want to call out is the fact that – following Jen's decision to step away – we've decided to flatten our leadership structure a bit and not fill the head of studios role. In line with Amazon's recent work to streamline reporting lines and accelerate decision making, we felt this was the best direction for our studio, which will now operate as distinct film and television studios. To that end, Courtenay Valenti (Head of Film) and Vernon Sanders (Head of TV) will now report directly to me, while Sue Kroll will also continue in her role leading global marketing across both film and TV. I'm immensely proud of the momentum our team at studios has built over past 12-18 months, executing against our strategic plan and developing a fantastic slate of original shows and films that position us for even more success ahead. Please join me in once again thanking Jen and wishing her the best on this next adventure…thankfully, she won't be far away and we still have much to do together. -Mike

"AppLovin CEO urges investors to 'dig deeper' after short-seller report, company retains Alex Spiro","AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi hit back at new short-selling allegations from Muddy Waters Research after the ad-tech company's stock suffered its steepest drop on record on Thursday.

Foroughi penned a new blog post that asked investors to ""dig deeper"" on the allegations, saying the report's claims about the success of their AI-powered ad tactics could be easily disproven by artificial intelligence models like Grok ""in minutes.""

Muddy Waters on Thursday became the third short-selling firm to publish research meant to raise significant investor skepticism about the company's technology, after AppLovin's stock price soared more than 700% last year.

The report said AppLovin's ad tactics ""systematically"" violate app stores' terms of service by ""impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, Google, and others.""

Foroughi wrote in his response that, ""Our business is technical, and we get it — it's not always easy to understand.""

""It's also incredibly hard for some who don't understand this technology to fathom that we are building the world's best advertising AI model, so they need a simple narrative that we're violating policies in order to comprehend our success,"" Foroughi wrote. ""This complexity leaves room for short reports to stir fear and doubt.""

AppLovin shares rose almost 4% on Friday after tumbling 20% a day earlier.

Prior to Muddy Waters' report, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published short-seller research critiquing AppLovin's technology as the company pushes into e-commerce.

AppLovin said on Friday that it retained Alex Spiro from law firm Quinn Emanuel to do ""an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity targeting the Company.""

A spokesperson told CNBC that Spiro, who also represents Elon Musk, was hired to ""investigate the short sellers as these tactics of spreading misinformation for personal gain cannot be allowed to continue unchecked.""

Analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their buy rating on AppLovin and $650 price target in a note on Friday.

""We think accusations of faulty conversions and fraud are easily disproved by speaking with performance marketers and measurement companies,"" they wrote. ""We have been very active on this front and are confident the platform is delivering excellent performance and driving meaningful revenue momentum.""

Muddy Waters Research did not yet provide additional comment.

Joel Greenblatt defends value investing: It's not difficult to beat the market,"Joel Greenblatt, a longtime bargain hunter, doesn't think value investing deserves its bad rap. The 67-year-old investor, now running Gotham Asset Management, believes that traditional criteria that define ""value,"" such as price-to-book and price-to-sales ratios, don't necessarily represent the essence of the philosophy. ""We're very cash flow oriented ... the way Morningstar or Russell classified value is not the way we look at value,"" Greenblatt said Wednesday at Value Invest conference in New York. ""We're literally valuing businesses, like we're private equity investors buying the whole business."" By the most commonly used measure, value stocks have been crushed by their growth counterparts over the past two decades. The Russell 1000 Value Index, including stocks with low price-to-book ratios and low sales-per-share growth, is up 189% over the past 20 years, compared to a near 700% rise in its growth stock counterpart. In the recovery after the financial crisis in 2008, growth stocks took over market leadership and enjoyed uninterrupted expansion in the decade-long bull run that followed. The great transition into passive investing using index funds and ETFs only further fueled growth names' meteoric rise. Many traditional value investors found themselves in a desperate spot as cheap shares suffered massive underperformance. Still, Greenblatt, who taught a value investing class at Columbia University for more than 20 years, said seasoned players with an eye for hidden gems are still able to perform better than the broader market. ""We all are familiar with the history that beating the market ... is difficult for active managers and I would argue for a second that it's not difficult,"" he said. ""I do think markets are emotional, and if you are [a] very disciplined value investor, which means ... trying to figure out what a business is worth and paying a reasonable or low price for it because the market sometimes gives you that gift, to buy the little bit cheaper than it's worth, disciplined investors can still do that."" Gotham Asset, which runs hedge funds as well as long-only mutual funds, has produced positive spreads for the past three years, Greenblatt said.

"Trump says Skadden, Arps law firm will provide $100 million in pro bono legal services, avoiding executive order","President Donald Trump said Friday that the large law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom has agreed to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services during the Trump administration and to take other steps that align with the president's concerns about hiring.

The agreement, which Trump called ""essentially a settlement,"" allows Skadden, Arps to avoid becoming the sixth elite law firm to be targeted by an executive order from Trump imposing various punishments.

The deal came five days after the billionaire Elon Musk — one of Trump's top advisors — tweeted ""Skadden, this needs to stop now"" in response to a social media post by conservative gadfly Dinesh D'Souza complaining that the firm's lawyers were litigating against him over a film he produced.

Trump last week rescinded his executive order targeting the law firm Paul, Weiss after that firm agreed to perform $40 million worth of pro bono — free — legal work for causes that the president supports.

Earlier Friday, two targeted law firms, WilmerHale and Jenner & Block, filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the executive orders targeting them.

A third targeted firm, Perkins Coie, sued the administration earlier this month over the order aimed at that firm.

Skadden, Arps Executive Partner Jeremy London, in a statement posted online by Trump on Friday, said, ""Skadden is

pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration.""

""We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement,"" London said. ""The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Admin.""

""We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/trump-skadden-law-firm-executive-order.html,cnbc
Trump sued by two more 'Big Law' firms he targeted in executive orders,"Signage is seen outside of the law firm WilmerHale in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 30, 2020.

Two more law firms sued the Trump administration on Friday over executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting them for employing attorneys who worked on criminal investigations of the president.

The lawsuits by WilmerHale and Jenner & Block come weeks after Perkins Coie filed a suit after it was targeted by a Trump order.

All three so-called Big Law firms claim in separate civil complaints in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that the retributive orders are clear violations of the U.S. Constitution.

Since February, Trump has signed executive orders targeting five law firms with punishments that included suspending their attorneys' security clearances, terminating federal contracts, launching investigations of their hiring practices, and barring them from access to federal buildings.

Trump's orders explicitly cited their employment of his longtime foes or their work on cases against him.

Last week, he rescinded one order — aimed at Paul, Weiss — after that firm struck an agreement with the Trump administration that included its attorneys committing to performing $40 million worth of pro bono work for causes that the president supports.

Trump's March 14 order against Paul, Weiss had pointed to the firm's 2022 re-hiring of what the president called ""unethical attorney"" Mark Pomerantz after the lawyer resigned from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where he oversaw a criminal investigation into Trump's finances.

WilmerHale, in its lawsuit Friday, said that Trump's orders are ""an undisguised form of retaliation for representing clients and causes he disfavors or employing lawyers he dislikes.""

Jenner & Block, in its complaint, called Trump's order against the firm ""an unconstitutional abuse of power against lawyers, their clients, and the legal system.""

""It is intended to hamper the ability of individuals and businesses to have the lawyers of their choice zealously represent them,"" Jenner's attorneys wrote.

""And it is intended to coerce law firms and lawyers into renouncing the Administration's critics and ceasing certain representations adverse to the government.""

On Feb. 25, Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi and other agency heads to suspend the security clearances of employees at law firm Covington & Burling who ""assisted"" former Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith during his investigations of Trump.

Smith's probes resulted in two federal criminal indictments against Trump. The cases were abandoned in late 2024 after the Republican won the presidential election due to a DOJ policy that bars prosecuting sitting presidents for federal crimes.

Covington has said they represent Smith in his personal capacity, and not as part of any investigation into Trump.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/trump-lawsuit-orders-wilmerhale-jenner-perkins.html,cnbc
"Canadians pull back on U.S. trips, threatening to widen United States' $50 billion travel deficit","Canadians hold an ""Elbows Up"" protest against U.S. tariffs and other policies by U.S. President Donald Trump, at Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto, Ontario, Canada March 22, 2025.

Canadians are skipping trips to the U.S. and visitors from other countries could soon follow threatening to deepen the United States' $50 billion travel deficit.

Experts say they're pulling back for a variety of reasons, ranging from an unfavorable currency exchange rate to the U.S. political climate given President Donald Trump's trade policies and his public statements on annexing Canada, as well as high-profile detainments of people who already had visas to be in the U.S., long wait visa times and other policies that have added to tensions with longtime close allies.

The trends are worrying some in the United States' travel industry, which draws in more than $1 trillion in direct spending a year.

The U.S. Travel Association said in a statement to CNBC that there is a ""a question of America's welcomeness, a slowing U.S. economy and recent safety concerns.

""These challenges are real and demand decisive action,"" the organization, whose members include large hotel groups, airlines and other major travel companies, said, adding that is ""actively working with the White House and Congress to advance policies that drive economic expansion and keep the U.S. competitive on the global stage.""

There are billions of dollars on the line. People from the United States already travel abroad and spend more in other countries than the U.S. brings in from foreign travelers.

Last year, the United States' travel deficit was more than $51 billion, meaning Americans spent that much more abroad than foreigners visiting the U.S. spent, stripping out spending for medical and educational purposes, which still showed a deficit, according to Commerce Department data.

The U.S. brought in more than 72 million visitors last year, still below pre-Covid levels, according to a report from Jefferies. Visitors from Canada were the largest group, accounting for 28%, followed by Mexico at 23%, the bank said in a note this month.

Travel and tourism of inbound visitors are counted as U.S. exports, and they accounted for about 8% of U.S. exports of goods and services, according to the Commerce Department.

International visitors from overseas are especially important because they tend to stay longer and spend more money than local tourists, according to the U.S. Travel Association.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/canada-united-states-travel.html,cnbc
We're buying more shares of 2 stocks as the broader market sinks further,"We're making our first trades of the week. We are buying 25 shares of Danaher at roughly $207 each. Following Friday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 550 shares of DHR, increasing its weighting to 3.5% from 3.35%. We are buying 10 shares of Home Depot at roughly $358. Following the trade, the Trust will own 355 shares of HD, increasing its weighting to 3.9% from 3.8%. Friday's market selloff picked up steam since the Morning Meeting as concerns about inflation, the economy, and tariffs weighed on stocks. With the market far lower than where it traded at the start of the week, we're making a couple of small buys to take advantage of Friday's lower prices. DHR 1Y mountain Danaher 1 year In a market struggling with the fact that earnings per share (EPS) estimates are likely too high for 2025, Danaher could stand out in first quarter earnings season because of how conservative it guided 2025 revenues and earnings. Analysts agree that the stock is more de-risked down at these levels, prompting two upgrades over the past couple of weeks. We're upgrading Danaher to our 1 rating as a reflection of Friday's buy. On March 14, Stifel upgraded its Danaher rating to a buy from hold with a $260 price target. The analysts argued that downward revisions to earnings estimates could be done and the first quarter ""may be more de-risked here than elsewhere when it comes to academic/govt demand."" Cuts to academic funding have been an overhang affecting the life sciences and tools group. Last Friday, Goldman Sachs raised its Danaher rating to a buy with a $260 price target and called the stock a ""bioprocessing recovery beneficiary at a more attractive valuation."" The Goldman analysts added that ""now that DHR has initiated their 2025 guide at ~3%, we believe numbers are in a position that will allow the company to get back to their historic beat and raise dynamic, something that has been lost over the last several years."" For years, we have known Danaher as a company that has under-promised and over-delivered. While it has lost its way over the past couple of years, due to cyclical challenges and inventory destocking, these headwinds may be behind Danaher as the bioprocessing recovery continues this year. We have expressed frustration with Danaher and its leadership team before, but we were pleased to see them take action with self-help initiatives that should improve margins. In late February, the company revealed in a 10-K filing that it initiated a cost-savings program that could be worth at least $150 million, which could translate to nearly 20 cents in EPS. With this small add, we're buying back half of the 50 shares that we trimmed around $250 in January. HD 1Y mountain Home Depot 1 year We are also nibbling on shares of Home Depot. This will be our fourth small purchase this month. Our previous buy was on March 13. In Tuesday's Homestretch , we talked about why we are keeping the faith in Home Depot despite the continued softness in the housing market. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HD, DHR.

These are analysts' favorite S&P 500 stocks as the second quarter approaches,"With the current quarter winding down, there are some stocks investors should keep an eye on heading into the next period. The new year's first quarter was a tumultuous one, with stocks facing significant volatility due to concerns around the state of the economy and uncertainty regarding President Donald Trump's tariff policies. That briefly sent the S & P 500 into correction territory, and the index lost more than $5 trillion in value in a matter of weeks. In the wake of the market's monthlong rout, the S & P 500's quarter-to-date losses sit at more than 4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 1.8% for the first quarter, and the Nasdaq Composite is down more than 9% during the period.

Its average price target implies nearly 51% upside, according to FactSet. The stock — which took a hit on the heels of Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this month — has fallen more than 18% on the quarter, underperforming the broader market. Over the past month, shares have plummeted more than 12%. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang downplayed the effect of tariffs, saying the near-term impact "" won't be meaningful ."" Most analysts covering Delta Air Lines are similarly bullish, with 72% of those that cover the carrier having a buy rating. Its average target also calls for 59.3% upside from here, per FactSet. Shares have likewise come under pressure in recent months, sliding more than 20% quarter to date. Those moves lower come as Delta earlier this month slashed its revenue and profit forecasts for the current quarter, pointing to weaker travel demand domestically. Western Digital also made the cut, with 62.5% of analysts covering the data storage stock having a buy rating. Its average target also implies 51.5% upside ahead.

Why investors should stay in stocks — despite the market turbulence,"Investors should see through the latest market turmoil and stay committed to the market, according to DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas. In a report out Friday, Colas reported anecdotes of squeamish investors as a result of President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy, on top of worries around the health of the broad economy. The effect has been drive up uncertainty and send stocks into a tailspin. The broad S & P 500 entered a correction at one point last week — down 10% from its February peak — and is now down about 3% on the year. But Colas said there are several reasons to stay optimistic on the market. He listed four main bulwarks supporting prices, and advised investors to take a pause and wait to see how the current volatility plays out before opting to sell. ""The temptation to just sell everything is strong right now,"" Colas wrote to clients. ""History proves the counterbalance to that sentiment. ... The bottom line: investing has gotten harder, but the long-term rewards are still there."" .SPX YTD mountain The S & P 500 in 2025 First, Colas pointed out that it takes a ""genuine"" shock like a war or crisis for the S & P 500 to fall more than 10% in a calendar year. If an investor doesn't believe an event like that will occur, it's worth staying in to see how things play out, he said. Next, he noted that while ""fear selling"" is easy, it's harder to ""fear buy."" In other words, the bottom of a market is difficult to call, making it tougher still to reenter stocks at the exact right time. Colas further highlighted that Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , is still in a bull market zone. Investors should only get worried when the index starts showing 19.5 as a ""floor rather than a ceiling,"" but emphasized that that's not the case today. The VIX, which uses options to measure how much investors think the S & P 500 could rise or fall in the next 30 days, traded Friday between 19.08 and 20.91. .VIX YTD mountain The VIX in 2025 Finally, while some investors are concerned about small-cap underperformance or a breakdown in large-cap technology leadership, Colas said good news elsewhere provides offsets. Sectors such as financials and industrials have been able to avoid the drawdown, he said. On top of this, many international equities been outperforming, and investors should equal-weight international equities to hedge against economic uncertainty in the U.S., Colas advised. Colas understands the concern around the market right now, but said investors should be ""accurately framing problems and then implementing solutions."" ""The last month has been the most exhausting stock market 'correction' I can recall,"" Colas wrote to clients before the market opened Friday. ""So many uncertainties, so few answers, and things could certainly get worse before they get better."" ""However, we know it takes a sharp shock, not just an annoying drip of negative news, to truly kill a bull market,"" he added. ""While another 5-10 percent decline is entirely possible, we don't think that is too heavy a price to pay for continued exposure to [U.S.] equities over the longer term.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/-why-investors-should-stay-in-stocks-despite-the-market-turbulence-.html,cnbc

"Consumer sentiment worsens as inflation fears grow, University of Michigan survey shows","A shopper pays with a credit card at the farmer's market in San Francisco on March 27, 2025.

The deterioration in consumer sentiment was even worse than anticipated in March as worries over inflation intensified, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

The final version of the university's closely watched Survey of Consumers showed a reading of 57.0 for the month, down 11.9% from February and 28.2% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting 57.9, which was the mid-month level.

It was the third consecutive decrease and stretched across party lines and income groups, survey director Joanne Hsu said.

""Consumers continue to worry about the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,"" she said.

In addition to worries about the current state of affairs, the survey's index of consumer expectations tumbled to 52.6, down 17.8% from a month ago and 32% for the same period in 2024.

Inflation fears drove much of the downturn. Respondents expect inflation a year from now to run at a 5% rate, up 0.1 percentage point from the mid-month reading, and a 0.7 percentage point acceleration from February. At the five-year horizon, the outlook now is for 4.1%, the first time the survey has had a reading above 4% since February 1993.

Economists worry President Donald Trump's tariff plans will spur more inflation, possibly curtailing the Federal Reserve from further interest rate cuts.

The report came the same day the Commerce Department said the core inflation rate increased to 2.8% in February, after a 0.4% monthly gain that was the biggest move since January 2024.

The latest results also reflect worries over the labor market, with the level of consumers expecting the unemployment rate to rise at the highest level since 2009.

Stocks took a hit after the university's survey was released, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading more than 500 points lower.

Trump pardons Nikola founder Trevor Milton in securities fraud case,"watch now

President Donald Trump pardoned Nikola Corp. founder Trevor Milton for his 2022 conviction of federal crimes related to defrauding investors with false claims about the success of the electric and hydrogen-powered truck maker. Milton, 42, was sentenced in December 2023 to four years in prison, but he has been free since then pending an appeal of the former CEO's criminal conviction on securities and wire fraud charges in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The pardon came two weeks after federal prosecutors urged District Court Judge Edgardo Ramos to order Milton to pay restitution of $680 million to Nikola shareholders, and another $15.2 million to Peter Hicks, a victim of his wire fraud. Because of the pardon, Ramos could not order restitution of any kind.

""Oh my gosh, oh, you won't believe what just happened,"" Milton said in an Instagram video posted on his personal account Thursday. ""Probably the best day I've had in five years."" ""I just got a call from the president of the United States, on my phone, and he signed my full and unconditional pardon of innocence,"" said Milton, who appeared to be driving a vehicle in the video. ""I am free. The prosecutors can no longer hurt me,"" he said. ""They can't destroy my family, they can't rip everything away from me, they can't ruin my life."" The White House confirmed the pardon. Trump later Friday was asked why he granted Milton a pardon. ""I think he was exonerated,"" Trump said told reporters at the White House. ""And then they brought him into New York, he had a rough, rough road, and ... he was exonerated. It was a big celebration. "" Milton was convicted at trial in October 2022. ""They say the thing that he did wrong was, he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald Trump for president,"" Trump said. ""He supported Trump. He liked Trump. I didn't know him, but he liked him."" Trump went on to say of Milton, ""They persecuted, they destroyed five years of his life. He ... fought for five years of his life, and he did nothing wrong."" ""And he's a good person."" Defense attorneys for Milton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Milton, declined to comment on the pardon. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, when it obtained an indictment against Milton in 2021, said some investors defrauded by his scheme ""suffered tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses, including, in certain cases, the loss of their retirement savings or funds that they had borrowed to invest in Nikola.""

In a press release Thursday, Milton said, ""This pardon is not just about me — it's about every American who has been railroaded by the government, and unfortunately, that's a lot of people."" Milton said that there are ""striking similarities"" between his case ""and those brought against President Trump."" The president was charged in four criminal cases between his first and second terms in the White House. After Trump was elected in November, the U.S. Justice Department sought the dismissal of the two federal cases, citing a department policy that bars the federal prosecution of sitting presidents. Following Milton's 2023 sentencing, the former Nikola CEO made significant political donations to Trump and his allies. This included $920,000 to the Trump 47 Committee in October of 2024, and $750,000 in September to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA Alliance political action committee. Kennedy, a former independent presidential candidate in 2024, was recently confirmed as Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services. Federal campaign finance records indicate that 2024 was the first year Milton ever made six-figure political contributions. As of midday Friday, there was no filing in Manhattan federal court or the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals indicating that the criminal case against Milton had been terminated due to a pardon. However, it is not uncommon for notices of presidential pardons to be filed with the court several days after the pardons are issued.

""It is no wonder why trust and confidence in the Justice Department has eroded to nothing,"" Milton said in the press release. ""I wish judges would stop believing whatever the prosecutors feed them so Americans could trust the justice system again,"" he said. ""Until that happens, our justice system will continue to erode until there is nothing left."" Trump's pardon of Milton, if confirmed, would erase his criminal conviction and the sentence, which included a $1 million fine.

A string of pardons

Earlier this month, Trump pardoned former Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey, who had just begun serving a 21-month prison term after pleading guilty in a federal campaign finance conspiracy case. In that case, it took a week after Kelsey was released from prison for the notice of the pardon to be filed in federal court. Earlier this week, Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Devon Archer, a one-time business partner of Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son. Like Milton, Archer had also been convicted in a fraud case.

Right after his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump notably pardoned around 1,500 people who were either charged or convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of the president's supporters. On his second day in office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence for crimes related to his dark web marketplace Silk Road.

In February, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich received a presidential pardon. Blagojevich had served eight years in prison after he was convicted of attempting to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama, after the first-term senator was elected president in 2008.

Nikola's collapse

In February, Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. The company said in a filing that it had liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion, and assets of between $500 million and $1 billion. It also sought court approval to pursue a sale of the business, saying it had about $47 million in cash on hand. Nikola, which makes primarily all-electric and fuel cell electric semi-trucks, has struggled in recent years. The company had only sold 600 vehicles since 2022, as of its most recent third quarter. As the company's capital has shrunk, many of its trucks have been recalled as a result of defects. In its third-quarter conference call, the company warned investors it had enough cash to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025, but not beyond that.

Elon Musk to travel to Wisconsin ahead of critical state Supreme Court election,"Tech billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk will head to Wisconsin days before the pivotal state Supreme Court election there, into which he's sunk millions of dollars on behalf of the conservative candidate and become a central figure in the race.

Musk made the announcement early Friday morning on his social media platform X, where he said he would be giving out a pair of $1 million checks to people who attend his speech, with attendance limited to those who voted in the election.

It's the latest redoubling of Musk's efforts in Wisconsin, where he has endorsed conservative Judge Brad Schimel, a circuit court judge and former state attorney general who is also backed by President Donald Trump. State campaign finance filings show $3 million in donations from Musk to the Wisconsin Republican Party so far this year, and Musk's super PAC, America PAC, is the top outside spender in the Supreme Court race. The group has spent more than $12 million so far, according to the latest data available through the state's campaign finance portal Friday morning.

America PAC has also offered Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a conservative-leaning petition ahead of the election and has awarded one petition-signer $1 million, the latest large award as part of Musk's efforts to encourage engagement with his political operations. (The group's controversial efforts to award million-dollar prizes to rally attendees and petition signers drew legal scrutiny both from the Justice Department and the Philadelphia district attorney last year, and his new efforts have also drawn new questions. But the Justice Department never took public action against Musk, and the Philadelphia district attorney's attempts to block Musk's giveaway were unsuccessful.)

Musk's heavy public involvement in Wisconsin has made him a main character in the battle for partisan control of the state Supreme Court, and it aligns with Republican efforts to motivate the base before Tuesday's off-year election.

Trump joined Schimel in a telephone town hall Thursday, Schimel's campaign has launched ads emphasizing Trump's endorsement and attacking the Democratic candidate on transgender issues, and an outside group backing Schimel is airing a new ad that criticizes an unrelated judicial decision blocking the Trump administration's deportation flights to argue that the state needs conservative judges like Schimel in power.

Democrats have responded to Musk's efforts by trying to make him a boogeyman. A majority of registered voters in Wisconsin view him unfavorably, according to a recent Marquette University Law School poll, similar to national findings from the latest NBC News poll.

Liberal candidate Susan Crawford launched an ad this month that accuses Musk of ""trying to buy Schimel a seat on the Supreme Court because he knows Schimel always helps his big campaign donors."" Crawford and the state Democratic Party repeatedly mention Musk as a foil on the campaign trail.

Musk first dipped into the race in January, endorsing Schimel in a post on X. The post came days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin challenging a law restricting carmakers from owning dealerships — a case that could end up before the state Supreme Court.

Musk's Wisconsin playbook mirrors how he engaged in the 2024 presidential election. His super PAC spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost Trump, primarily on get-out-the-vote efforts like canvassing, direct mail and text messaging, as well as digital advertising — the same kinds of expenses America PAC is incurring to boost Schimel.

America PAC also gave out money to signers of a different petition, and launched a controversial $1 million giveaway to petition-signers that was unsuccessfully challenged in court. Musk also barnstormed swing states and spoke on the stump.

Musk has also been engaged, albeit to a significantly lesser extent, in another race to be held on Tuesday: the special election in Florida to replace former GOP Rep. Michael Waltz, who was tapped as Trump's national security adviser. America PAC has spent about $76,000 in independent expenditures there, according to federal campaign finance data.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/elon-musk-to-travel-to-wisconsin-ahead-of-critical-state-supreme-court-election.html,cnbc

Money market account vs. money market fund: What's the difference and which one is right for you?,"For folks seeking a low-risk way to increase their savings, both money market accounts and money market funds hold a lot of appeal. But despite their similar names, these two savings vehicles are very different. Here's how to decide which account works best for your goals. What we'll cover What is a money market account?

What is a money market account?

A money market account (MMA) is a specific type of savings account available through your bank or credit union. It is insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (banks) or the National Credit Union Administration (credit unions). At its best, a money market account blends the reliability (and high APYs) of a savings account with the accessibility of a checking account. You can write checks, easily withdraw cash and generally have quick access to your money. This makes MMAs a good place to park cash meant for: an emergency fund

What is a money market fund?

Unlike a money market account, which is a deposit account, a money market fund is a type of mutual fund invested in low-risk cash, cash-equivalent or debt-based securities. And while these funds count as some of the safest investments on the market, they're exposed to the whims of the market, and as a result, there's a risk you could lose you money. So why take a chance, no matter how small, on taking a loss? Because the returns on a money market fund are likely higher than the APY you might earn with any deposit account, including MMAs. This depends on the performance of the market (as well as the APY rates that banks set for their MMAs), but the possibility of earning a higher return makes money market funds a tempting choice. You can open a fund through a brokerage like Fidelity or Charles Schwab by providing some personal information and then depositing your funds. Getting money from your money market fund is a straightforward process, but it will take longer than withdrawing money from an MMA. Transactions from brokerage accounts typically take a business day or two, and unless you've set up a checking account through your brokerage company, you'll need to transfer funds to your bank account before withdrawing.

Because it can take a few days to withdraw your money from a money market fund, they aren't the best places to put cash you need immediately, like your emergency savings. And while the returns on a money market fund may outpace most deposit accounts, they usually pale in comparison to other investments, which makes them less than ideal for long-term goals such as retirement. It's best to talk to a financial advisor about how the low-risk investments of a money market fund fit into your overall investment strategy, rather than seeing it as a replacement for a savings or money market account.

Which one is best for you?

If you're looking for a safe place to stash your savings, an MMA might be your best bet. A money market account typically offers a higher APY than most traditional savings accounts, plus you can easily access your money and you get the financial security of FDIC protection on balances up to $250,000. The decision to go with a money market fund will have more to do with your attitude toward investing. If you can tolerate some risk and don't anticipate needing to withdraw money in a hurry, then money market funds can grow your cash quicker than most bank accounts. This can make the funds useful for reaching some of the same short-term goals (future, predictable expenses) that MMAs help with — provided you can stomach the potential ups and downs of the market.

"If Chinese-built containership fines take effect, 'we're out of business in U.S.,' ocean carrier says","Niche ocean carrier Atlantic Container Line is warning the fines the U.S. government is considering hitting Chinese-built freight vessels with would force it to leave the United States and throw the global supply chain out of balance, potentially fueling freight rates not seen since Covid.

""This hits American exporters and importers worse than anybody else,"" said Andrew Abbott, CEO of ACL. ""If this happens, we're out of business and we're going to have to shut down.""

The United States Trade Representative held its second day of this week's hearings on the fines that would be levied under Section 301 of U.S. trade law on Wednesday, with over 300 trade groups and other interested parties warning the government across comments letters and in testimony that the U.S. is no position to win an economic war that places ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels in the middle. Soon, Chinese-made vessels will represents 98% of the trade ships on the world's oceans.

The policy proposal, begun under the Biden administration and culminating in a January report concluding China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage, would allow the U.S. government to impose steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports. For Chinese-owned operators (such as Cosco), a service fee of up to $1 million could be charged on each vessel. For non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.

In ACL's submitted commentary to the USTR, Abbott laid bare the economic difficulties his company would face, saying that if the U.S. government went ahead with the fines, it ""would render us totally uncompetitive versus the other carriers in the US trades.""

ACL, which is the oldest continually operating container line in the world and is owned by Grimaldi Group of Italy, is the only operator of combination container-roll-on-roll-off ships between North America and North Europe.

If ACL abandoned the U.S. market, domestic manufacturers would lose their only U.S.-headquartered North Atlantic carrier, and primary North Atlantic carrier of oversized and project cargo to Europe. ACL handles vehicles, construction equipment, aircraft including Airbus wings, and project cargo, including more than half of the American construction equipment, agricultural equipment and oversized machinery moving from the ports of New York, Baltimore and Norfolk to Europe.

""All the Airbus wings are made here in the U.S. and we carry those to the UK,"" Abbott told CNBC. ""If we disappear, you'd have to find another brake bulk ship.""

Abbott made clear to CNBC that his company's situation is unique and the largest ocean carriers will be able to better mitigate the impact of the potential fines. ""I'm going to end up hitting a customer with a $2,000 to $2,500 charge, where the big guys might only have $800, so in today's world, that is an enormous amount of money, and potentially could put us out of business. So we'd be forced to pull our ships out of the Atlantic, out of the U.S. trades, and probably stick them in Asia, that's what we would do.""

The goal of the policy proposals are to revive the U.S. domestic shipbuilding industry, but many commentators have argued that these fines are the wrong way to pursue that goal. Abbott said this is why he went public with his company's situation. ""The Chinese operators that they're trying to go against because of the way they operate their ships, and the number of ports that they're calling, are probably going to be among the least affected by this new setup. So the guys you want to target are getting off scot free, and the guys who were in your own country get nailed,"" Abbott said.

The closing of ACL's U.S. offices would impact 300 employees in addition to the supply chain pipeline that supports them, such as truck drivers and warehouse workers.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/if-china-freight-ship-fines-hit-were-out-of-business-in-us-carrier-warns.html,cnbc
"Bill Gates: Within 10 years, AI will replace many doctors and teachers—humans won't be needed 'for most things'","Over the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will mean that humans will no longer be needed ""for most things"" in the world, says Bill Gates.

That's what the Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist told comedian Jimmy Fallon during an interview on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" in February. At the moment, expertise remains ""rare,"" Gates explained, pointing to human specialists we still rely on in many fields, including ""a great doctor"" or ""a great teacher.""

But ""with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace — great medical advice, great tutoring,"" Gates said.

In other words, the world is entering a new era of what Gates called ""free intelligence"" in an interview last month with Harvard University professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks. The result will be rapid advances in AI-powered technologies that are accessible and touch nearly every aspect of our lives, Gates has said, from improved medicines and diagnoses to widely available AI tutors and virtual assistants.

""It's very profound and even a little bit scary — because it's happening very quickly, and there is no upper bound,"" Gates told Brooks.

The debate over how, exactly, most humans will fit into this AI-powered future is ongoing. Some experts say AI will help humans work more efficiently — rather than replacing them altogether — and spur economic growth that leads to more jobs being created.

Others, like Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, counter that continued technological advancements over the next several years will change what most jobs look like across nearly every industry, and have a ""hugely destabilizing"" impact on the workforce.

""These tools will only temporarily augment human intelligence,"" Suleyman wrote in his book ""The Coming Wave,"" which was published in 2023. ""They will make us smarter and more efficient for a time, and will unlock enormous amounts of economic growth, but they are fundamentally labor replacing.""",2025-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/bill-gates-on-ai-humans-wont-be-needed-for-most-things.html,cnbc
Russia's Putin says it would be a 'profound mistake' to dismiss Trump's push for Greenland,"In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a video-linked ceremony to launch the Project 885M Yasen-M nuclear-powered submarine Perm, in the Arctic Circle port city of Murmansk on March 27, 2025.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned it would be foolish to dismiss U.S. President Donald Trump's push for control of Greenland, saying the move is unsurprising given America's longtime interest in the mineral-rich territory.

Delivering a major speech in Russia's Murmansk, the world's largest city north of the Arctic Circle, Putin said on Thursday that Trump's stated intent to annex Greenland ""is an issue that concerns two specific nations and has nothing to do with us.""

""It is a profound mistake to treat it as some preposterous talk by the new U.S. administration. Nothing of the sort,"" Putin said.

He added that the U.S. had such plans ""as far back as the 1860s"" and flagged that the country had offered to buy Greenland from Denmark after World War II.

""In short, the United States has serious plans regarding Greenland. These plans have long historical roots, as I have just mentioned, and it is obvious that the United States will continue to consistently advance its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic,"" Putin said.

His comments, which were not critical of Trump's intentions, come as U.S. Vice President JD Vance prepares to lead a high-profile U.S. delegation to Greenland on Friday.

Vance said in a video posted on social media platform X earlier this week that he would join his wife, Usha Vance, to ""check out what's going on with the security"" of Greenland.

Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to gain control of the autonomous Danish territory, describing the prospect as an ""absolute necessity"" for purposes related to national security.

The respective governments of both Greenland and Denmark have voiced firm opposition to Trump's plans, with Mute Egede, the outgoing prime minister of Greenland, earlier this month saying: ""Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.""

Putin on Thursday noted that the importance of the Arctic was increasing for Russia as well as the rest of the world, saying that at the same time ""geopolitical competition and fighting for positions in this region are also escalating.""

In his speech he also outlined Russia's plans for the Arctic, saying it was a ""critical priority"" to improve transport and logistics in the region.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/putin-says-it-would-be-a-mistake-to-dismiss-trumps-push-for-greenland.html,cnbc

"The CoreWeave IPO is key to 2 portfolio stocks — plus, Lilly bucks a down market","Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a ""Morning Meeting"" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. Wall Street turned sharply lower after a moderately weaker open. A hotter-than-expected inflation reading from the Fed's preferred price gauge knocked the S & P 500 and Nasdaq down 1.4% and 2%, respectively. If they were to close Friday's session at these levels, the S & P 500 and Nasdaq would finish the week lower. That would also add to their terrible monthly and first-quarter declines with just Monday's trading session left in March. Worries about President Donald Trump 's tariffs impact on the economy and inflation have been the overriding headwind on Wall Street. 2. Doubts about the AI trade are also permeating the market. During Friday's Morning Meeting, Jim Cramer said, ""The data center has got a negative grip on the market."" Jim said it's all about CoreWeave's troubled path to its initial public offering, which was priced Thursday night at $40 per share, below the expected range. This offering is important for two Club names: Nvidia , because it owns a chunk of CoreWeave and Goldman Sachs , because how trading goes could set the tone for the IPO market and impact investment bank advisory fees. 3. Europe rejected Eli Lilly 's Alzheimer's drug Kisunla over concerns that the benefits don't outweigh the risks. The drug, however, has been approved in the U.S., Japan, China, and other markets. Lilly said it remains confident in Kisunla's safety and will seek European approval through a re-examination process. Investors seem to be shrugging off the news. Jim said he was worried ""because anything negative is usually in the market is viewed very aggressively."" Obesity and diabetes are more important to Lilly. ""They got to leapfrog Novo,"" Jim said, referring to Lilly's top competitor in the market for obesity and diabetes drugs, Novo Nordisk . 4. Stocks covered in Friday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Lululemon , Applied Materials , and Oracle . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long LLY, NVDA, GS. See here for a full list of the stocks.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio.

Jim Cramer's top 10 things to watch in the stock market Friday,"My top 10 things to watch Friday, March 28 1. Wall Street was headed for a lower open, with weekly gains as of Thursday's close in jeopardy. Tariff uncertainty is sitting on the market as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge came in hotter than expected. 2. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.8% year over year — above the expected 2.7% gain. Meanwhile, consumer spending posted a smaller-than-expected increase. 3. The debacle that is CoreWeave : Does it signal the end of the data center theme (for now)? The IPO was priced at $40 per share, below the expected range. Debuts on the Nasdaq today. Club name Nvidia is a big shareholder. 4. President Donald Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on imported autos and auto parts slammed Detroit's carmakers. Shares of General Motors fell over 7% yesterday and were modestly lower today. 5. Nippon Steel is closing in on U.S. Steel . Semafor reports that Japan-based Nippon is willing to invest as much as $7 billion U.S. Steel to get Trump to approve their merger. 6. Citizens JMP cut its Reddit price target to $155 per share from $200 but kept its outperform rating. The analysts cited tariffs as something that could lead to lower demand for digital advertising. 7. Lululemon delivered a softer guide but do not give up on this. The bar is now set low. Shares sank 12%. Raymond James downgraded to hold-equivalent on slowing growth. Other Wall Street analysts cut their price targets. 8. Piper Sandler makes a case that Etsy and eBay should merge to create more value. The analysts said Etsy needs frequency, data, and scale, which eBay has plus AI investments. Piper admits the likelihood of deal is ""relatively low."" 9. Citizens JMP came away from a Robinhood event liking the stock very much due to moves into ""new sizable addressable markets"" The analysts reiterated their outperform buy rating and $77-per-share price target. 10. Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on chip designer Arm Holdings to $150 per share from $175 but kept its overweight buy rating.

"Why market AI worries are overblown — plus, a key approval for a portfolio health stock","Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market moves: Stocks were lower Thursday as the market continued to digest the latest trade policy headlines. The S & P 500 fought its way to positive territory a couple of times during the session. Defensive sectors with limited economic sensitivity like staples and utilities are outperforming — but those rarely have the makings of a good rally. Tech troubles : Weakness in technology and the artificial intelligence trade remained drags on a market that struggled with conflicting headlines about the pace of the data center buildout and AI usage. On Wednesday, a TD Cowen note that said Microsoft is canceling data center leases sparked fears about the group, with investors ignoring how the report also mentions that Cowen's checks indicate data center demand is up year over year and that Alphabet and Meta Platforms quickly swooped in to take Microsoft's capacity. That, plus real estate firm Related Companies saying Thursday it plans to raise $8 billion for data center developments sounds positive to us. Another bullish headline was an update from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who said ChatGPT's GPUs ""are melting"" following increased usage of a new image generation feature on the AI model. However, the market's appetite for AI stocks will be put to the test later Thursday evening. That's when CoreWeave is expected to price its IPO. Key approval: Abbott Laboratories is one of the biggest gainers in the S & P 500 on Thursday after the diversified healthcare company received a significant regulatory win for one of its medical devices. The Club company announced that it has received approval in Europe for its Volt PFA system, which is used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). PFA stands for pulsed-field ablation. The approval came in earlier than expected, according to analysts at Piper Sandler, who said Thursday that this approval increases their confidence in Abbott's ability to grow its electrophysiology business in the high single digits this year, with accelerating growth in 2026. Meanwhile, TD Cowen said they expect the FDA to approve the system in the first half of 2026. This positive development is significant for Abbott as it works to gain ground on Medtronic and Boston Scientific in the PFA market. Up next: The big earnings report after the closing bell is Lululemon . The results and outlook from the athleisure wear company will be a new data point about the state of consumer spending. Inflation will be in focus Friday, at 8:30 a.m. ET, when the February PCE price index is released. The index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to have increased 2.5% year over year in February, steady from the month before. The core reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 2.7% in February, up from 2.6% gain in January. Then at 10 a.m. ET, the final read on March University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations is out. Recent survey data has shown weakening consumer sentiment along with increasing one-year inflation expectations — which makes for a double whammy when thinking about the economy.

Why we're sticking with Goldman despite a peer's lackluster dealmaking results,"Shares of Club name Goldman Sachs fell Thursday after an investment banking rival reported disappointing quarterly results. But we're brushing off any concern here. The news Jefferies Financial Group posted lackluster first-quarter earnings results Wednesday evening, with profits weighed down by weakness in its investment banking division. In the quarter ended Feb. 28, total revenues from investment banking — home to services such advising for mergers and acquisitions (M & A) and underwriting for initial public offerings (IPOs) — fell 3% from the prior year and 29% compared with the September-to-November period. Explaining the weakness, CEO Rich Handler said that ""capital markets have become increasingly more challenging due to the uncertainties that have arisen around U.S. policy and geopolitical events."" Meanwhile, the firm's capital markets division, which includes its equity and fixed-income trading desks, was lower on a year-over-year basis, but up sequentially. Oppenheimer came to Jefferies' defense Thursday, maintaining the firm's hold-equivalent rating on the stock. ""We wouldn't read too much into any one quarter's trading results given strong performance otherwise recently, and other investment banking and investment returns can be inherently volatile,"" the analysts wrote. Still, Jefferies shares plunged over 9% Thursday. The stock is down more than 30% year to date. Big picture The earnings report comes ahead of first-quarter results from the nation's largest banks next month, including Club holdings Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. It offers investors a glimpse into how Wall Street has navigated the early part of the Trump administration. President's Donald Trump's perceived softer stance on antitrust rules and banking regulation fueled hopes that dealmaking would pick up following a multi-year slump due to higher borrowing costs, macroeconomic uncertainty and the Biden administration's aggressive antitrust enforcement. But the rebound in M & A has so far failed to materialize this year as trade tensions heated up and recession concerns mounted. Goldman and other investment banks have seen their stocks come under pressure as investors recalibrated their expectations. Not all hope is lost for the dealmaking environment yet, though. Goldman is reportedly working with popular chat app Discord on its planned IPO, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. Discord could seek a stock market listing in 2025, the report said, but these plans can still change. Goldman is also one of the advisors for AI cloud provider CoreWeave 's highly anticipated IPO, which has targeted a valuation of more than $35 billion . Shares are expected to debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker CRWV on Friday. Other companies slated to go public this year including ticker reseller StubHub and fintech firm Klarna have tapped Goldman's services. GS YTD mountain Goldman Sachs (GS) year-to-date performance Bottom line Jefferies' earnings report doesn't bode especially well for Goldman's upcoming release next month. But Jim Cramer still remains upbeat on the stock, which we bought more of last week . ""I don't think we should give up on Goldman just because Jefferies reported a quarter that's suboptimal,"" he said during Thursday's Morning Meeting . Perhaps we'd be more concerned if Goldman shares had been on a tear in 2025. But the slower-than-expected M & A recovery appears to be priced in already. The stock is nearly 17% below its record high last month — including a more than 2% slide Thursday — and down more than 2% year to date. Additionally, the stock market's volatility could be good news for Goldman's equity trading business, balancing out some of the disappointment in investment banking. While the rebound in dealmaking hasn't ignited as quickly as we wanted, that doesn't mean it will never happen. CoreWeave's upcoming public debut also will be a big test of investor appetite. A successful IPO may add more deals to the pipeline, with Goldman getting its fair share of them. Getting past April 2 — the day that Trump has said he will announce a batch of reciprocal tariffs — could be helpful, too. ""There's an idea that once we get past [that] maybe there will be more visibility about trade and tariff policy. With that added visibility, maybe you'll get more deals,"" said Jeff Marks, the Investing Club's director of portfolio analysis. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GS, WFC.

"Lululemon shares drop 15% as CEO says inflation, economic concerns are weighing on spending","Lululemon beat Wall Street expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, but issued 2025 guidance that disappointed analysts.

On an Thursday earnings call, CEO Calvin McDonald said the athleticwear company conducted a survey earlier this month that found that consumers are spending less due to economic and inflation concerns, resulting in lower U.S. traffic at Lululemon and industry peers. However, he said, shoppers responded well to innovation at the company.

""There continues to be considerable uncertainty driven by macro and geopolitical circumstances. That being said, we remain focused on what we can control,"" McDonald said.

Shares of the apparel company plunged 15% on Friday morning.

Lululemon was only the latest retailer to say it expects slower sales for the rest of this year as concerns grow about a weakening economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs. Even so, the Canada-based company said it expected only a minimal hit to profits from the U.S. trade war with countries including Canada, Mexico and China.

Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 2, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $6.14 vs. $5.85 expected

$6.14 vs. $5.85 expected Revenue: $3.61 billion vs. $3.57 billion expected

Fourth-quarter revenue rose from $3.21 billion during the same period in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $10.59 billion, up from $9.62 billion in 2023.

Lululemon's fiscal 2024 contained 53 weeks, one week longer than its fiscal 2023. Excluding the 53rd week, fourth-quarter and full-year revenue both rose 8% year over year for 2024.

Lululemon expects first-quarter revenue to total $2.34 billion to $2.36 billion, while Wall Street analysts were expecting $2.39 billion, according to LSEG. The retailer anticipates it will post full-year fiscal 2025 revenue of $11.15 billion to $11.30 billion, compared to the analyst consensus estimate of $11.31 billion.

For the first quarter, the company expects to post earnings per share in the range of $2.53 to $2.58, missing Wall Street's expectation of $2.72, according to LSEG. Full-year earnings per share guidance came in at $14.95 to $15.15 per share, while analysts anticipated $15.31.

CFO Meghan Frank said on the Thursday earnings call that gross margin for 2025 is expected to fall 0.6 percentage points due to higher fixed costs, foreign exchange rates and U.S. tariffs on China and Mexico.

Lululemon reported a net income for the fourth quarter of $748 million, or $6.14 per share, compared with a net income of $669 million, or $5.29 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Comparable sales, which Lululemon defines as revenue from e-commerce and stores open at least 12 months, rose 3% year over year for the quarter. The comparison excludes the 53rd week of the 2024 fiscal year. Analysts expected the metric to rise 5.1%.

Comparable sales in the Americas were flat, while they grew 20% internationally. Lululemon has been facing a sales slowdown in the U.S., although McDonald said its U.S. business stabilized in the second half of the year and partially attributed the improvement to new merchandise. He added that Lululemon will expand its stores to Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic this year.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2024.html,cnbc
Why GM stock is getting hit the hardest by Trump auto tariffs,"The GM logo is seen on a water tank of the General Motors assembly plant in Ramos Arizpe, in Coahuila state, Mexico, on Feb. 11, 2021.

The divergence stems from the amount of vehicles that GM imports, and its exposure to Mexico in particular.

Shares of GM fell more than 7% in Thursday trading, far underperforming the likes of Ford and Stellantis , which shed more than 3% and roughly 1%, respectively. Tesla stock was essentially unchanged for the day.

As auto stocks reacted to the latest tariff announcement out of Washington, D.C., on Thursday, General Motors took the brunt of the hit.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his administration would impose 25% tariffs on ""all cars that are not made in the United States"" and some automobile parts. The executive order signed Wednesday allows for some leniency for components that are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but it was not immediately clear what relief that might offer the North American automotive industry.

""Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. ""GM has the most exposure to Mexico.""

Mexico accounted for 16.2% of vehicle imports into the U.S. as a percentage of sales in 2024, according to GlobalData. That was the largest share of any country, about double the shares of South Korea and Japan, which ranked second and third in terms of import volume, respectively.

Roughly 52% of GM vehicles sold in the U.S. during the first three quarters of 2024 were assembled in the U.S., according to research by Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That leaves 30% assembled in Canada and Mexico, and another 18% brought in from other countries.

Levy also pointed out that GM relies heavily on Mexico and South Korea for production of some of its small crossovers, including its Equinox and Blazer vehicles.

""Roughly half of GM's US sales are produced in the US, but imported parts are a concern,"" he said.

During the same period, 57% of Stellantis vehicles and 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled stateside. Levy reported Stellantis assembled 39% of its U.S.-sold units in Canada and Mexico, and Ford, just 21%.

Wolfe Research's Emmanuel Rosner said the tariffs primarily affect foreign-brand automakers, but noted that 15% of GM's U.S. vehicles come from South Korea.

John Murphy from Bank of America said in comparison to the broader automotive market, GM is ""relatively exposed to the tariffs"" and may need to rebalance.

GM stock is down 13% year to date. Shares fell sharply in late January after investors worried that the automaker did not address concerns about tariffs in its most recent earnings report.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/gm-stock-trump-auto-tariffs.html,cnbc

Auto stocks are digesting President Donald Trump's announcement that he would place 25% tariffs on ""all cars that are not made in the United States,"" as well as certain automobile parts. Trump's administration had been telegraphing plans to put tariffs on the auto industry, but the effect of those moves and mechanism for enforcement are starting to take shape. The President's executive order said the tariffs would take effect for vehicles on April 3 and for auto parts by May 3. Shares of the ""Detroit Three"" all fell. General Motors stock dropped move than 7%, while Stellantis and Ford Motor shares lost roughly 1% and more than 3%, respectively. Shares of Tesla , however, were mostly unchanged. ""In our coverage, for [original equipment manufacturers], Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. ""GM has the most exposure to Mexico.""

Trump said Wednesday he would not put a tariff on vehicles that are built in the U.S. The tariffs apply to imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts including engines and transmissions, the White House said in a fact sheet. Some aspects of the tariffs are still getting worked out. Auto parts that are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement will remain tariff-free until the commerce secretary can consult with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to figure out how to apply tariffs to non-U.S. content.

The United Auto Workers union cheered Trump's announcement. ""These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.,"" UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement Wednesday. Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council — which represents Ford, GM and Stellantis — said in a statement that the AAPC was ""committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans."" Still, Blunt cautioned that tariffs should be implemented in a way ""that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector."" Vehicles are made up of tens of thousands of parts, many of which cross back and forth over the U.S. border before a final product is completed. Data and forecasting firm S&P Global Mobility reports there are on average 20,000 parts in a vehicle when it is torn down to its nuts and bolts. Parts may originate anywhere from 50 to 120 countries. The firm also reports that 25 automakers on average produce 63,900 light-duty passenger vehicles in North America per day. A majority of those, roughly 65%, are assembled in the U.S., followed by 27% in Mexico and 8% in Canada.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/auto-stocks-trump-tariffs.html,cnbc
Ferrari says it will raise prices by 10% on some models to offset auto tariffs,"The Ferrari logo is seen outside the Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, Italy.

Ferrari said Thursday it will raise prices by 10% on certain models after April 1 in response to new U.S. auto tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.

The Maranello, Italy-based sports car maker said prices will remain unchanged for all cars imported before April 2. After that, the ""commercial terms"" for three of its model families — the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma — will ""remain unchanged,"" the company said in a release.

Yet, its more popular models, including the Purosangue SUV, the 12Cilindri and the F80, will get price increases of up to 10%.

For the Purosangue, which starts at about $430,000, that price hike amounts to about $43,000. For the limited edition F80, which starts at more than $3.5 million, the increase will add more than $350,000 to the price tag.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced tariffs of 25% on all cars not made in the U.S. Ferrari produces all of its cars at its Maranello factory.

Last year, Ferrari produced 13,752 cars. The company plans to launch its first all-electric Ferrari in October.

It is unclear what effect the tariffs will have on Ferrari sales, since there is already a waiting list of more than a year for most of its vehicles. Ferrari buyers are generally wealthy enough to easily absorb the price hikes.

Ferrari also said Thursday it ""confirms its financial targets for 2025"" but added that there is a ""potential risk of 50 basis points on profitability percentage margins.""

In an interview with CNBC this month, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said even though Ferrari buyers are wealthy, the company has to be sensitive to passing on too much of the added cost of tariffs.

""When we look at the client, we consider that these people to buy a Ferrari, they have to work,"" he said. ""We have to respect them. Because for us, the most important thing is the client. So we need to make sure that we treat them in the right way.""

Shares of Ferrari were slightly higher Thursday morning, while shares of the U.S. ""Big Three"" automakers were largely lower.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/ferrari-to-raise-prices-to-offset-auto-tariffs.html,cnbc
Taiwan accuses China's biggest chipmaker SMIC of 'illegally' poaching tech talent,"A logo hangs on the building of the Beijing branch of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) on December 4, 2020 in Beijing, China.

The ministry said Taiwan began investigating the issue in December 2024. Eleven Chinese enterprises suspected of paoching talent were investigated, it said, with agents conducting searches at 34 locations and questioning 90 individuals.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the claims and SMIC was not immediately available for comment.

Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MIJB) said in a statement that SMIC had used a Samoa-based entity as cover to set up a subsidiary on the island ""under the guise of foreign investment"" and has been ""actively recruiting"" talent from Taiwan.

SMIC is China's biggest semiconductor manufacturing firm. It was thrust into the spotlight in 2023 when it was revealed to be the maker of the 7 nanometer chip in Huawei's smartphone at the time. A few years prior, SMIC was put on a U.S. government export blacklist.

China has been trying to ramp up its chipmaking capabilities via SMIC, but the company remains behind competitors like TSMC in Taiwan. Chip export restrictions imposed by the U.S. also mean SMIC is unable to access the latest chipmaking tools from critical suppliers like ASML that could allow it to catch up.

Taiwan is a hotbed of talent in the semiconductor industry as it is home to TSMC, the world's biggest and most advanced chipmaker. The U.S. has sought to tap into this talent, and bring more chipmaking capabilities to its shores, by convincing TSMC to build more manufacturing capacity in the country.

Taiwan's MJIB said it set up a special task force at the end of 2020 to investigate allegations of ""illegal poaching"" of talent.

""Chinese enterprises often disguise their identities through various means, including setting up operations under the guise of Taiwanese, overseas Chinese, or foreign-invested companies, while in reality being backed by Chinese capital, establishing unauthorized business locations in Taiwan without government approval, and using employment agencies to falsely assign employees to Taiwanese firm,"" the ministry said.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/taiwan-alleges-china-chipmaker-smic-illegally-poached-tech-talent.html,cnbc
"Hillary Clinton blasts Trump, officials over Signal text mess: 'Stupidity' and 'hypocrisy'","Hillary Clinton speaks on the first night of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center in Chicago, Ill., on Monday, August 19, 2024.

Hillary Clinton on Friday excoriated President Donald Trump and his administration for their handling of the embarrassing leak of U.S. military attack plans to a journalist who was accidentally added to a Signal app text thread with other top officials this month.

""It's not the hypocrisy that bothers me; it's the stupidity,"" Clinton wrote in a New York Times opinion piece.

""We're all shocked — shocked! — that President Trump and his team don't actually care about protecting classified information or federal record retention laws,"" the former secretary of state wrote.

""But we knew that already.""

""What's much worse is that top Trump administration officials put our troops in jeopardy by sharing military plans on a commercial messaging app and unwittingly invited a journalist into the chat,"" Clinton wrote.

""That's dangerous. And it's just dumb.""

Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential election, said the Signal scandal is ""the latest in a string of self-inflicted wounds by the new administration that are squandering America's strength and threatening our national security.""

The Democrat noted the Trump administration's firing of federal workers who protect nuclear weapons, shutting down efforts to fight pandemics, and what she called ""performative fights over wokeness"" by Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.

White House spokesman Harrison Field, in a statement to CNBC when asked about Clinton's essay, said, ""Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.""

Trump and his Republican allies — including people on the Signal chat thread — for years have castigated Clinton for her use of a private email server to conduct official business as secretary of state under then-President Barack Obama.

""Any security professional — military, government or otherwise — would be fired on the spot for this type of conduct and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information,"" Hegseth said on Fox News in 2016.

Trump at an October 2016 campaign rally said, ""Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.""

The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in an article Monday revealed that he accepted a communications request from a Signal app user identified as Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz on March 11, and that he was added two days later to a Signal chat group called ""Houthi PC Group.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/hillary-clinton-trump-signal-texts-hegseth-waltz-leak-houthi-yemen.html,cnbc
Greenland forms new government hours before visit by U.S. Vice President Vance,"(L-R) Greenland politician Aqqalu Jerimiassen, Jens-Frederik Nielsen the leader of the Demokraatit party, the Prime Minister of Greenland Múte Bourup Egede and Vivian Motzfeldt of the Siumut party attend the announcement of a coalition agreement to form the next government, on March 28, 2025 in Nuuk, Greenland.

Greenland presented a new government coalition agreement on Friday, just hours before a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance to the Arctic island that President Donald Trump has expressed interest in acquiring.

The new majority government will be headed by Democrats leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who had urged parties to set aside disagreements and form a broad coalition to show unity amid Trump's campaign to annex the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The pro-business Democrats, who favour gradual independence from Denmark, emerged as the biggest party, tripling their representation to 10 seats in a March 11 general election.

Since taking office in January, Trump has vowed to make Greenland part of the United States, saying it is vital to U.S. security interests, an idea rejected by most Greenlanders.

Greenland's strategic location and largely untapped mineral resources are attractive to the U.S. It lies along the shortest air route from Europe to North America, vital for the U.S. ballistic missile warning system, and the U.S. already has a base there.

The U.S. delegation, which is led by Vance and will also include his wife Usha, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was scheduled to land at around 1530 GMT at the U.S. base, at Pituffik in the north of the island.

Tariff whiplash triggers surge in fear-based shopping across U.S.,"Consumer confidence in where the economy is headed hit a 12-year low this week, according to the Conference Board. A fresh reading out of University of Michigan today also showed a deterioration in overall sentiment with a 12% drop from February, marking the third month of decline.

Despite Americans' concerns about the economy, they seem to be spending more. Roughly one in five Americans are shopping out of fear of future price hikes, which some experts refer to as doom spending.

Doom spending means making impulsive purchases largely driven out of fear over what the future may bring. In some cases, it's a kind of retail therapy, but it can also be a strategy to get ahead of economic uncertainty.

""People are worried for a number of reasons,"" Wendy De La Rosa, a Wharton professor who studies consumer behavior, told CNBC. ""We as humans hate uncertainty and are averse to volatility. And so when there's whiplash happening at a national level as to what tariffs are happening with which country and how it's going to affect our domestic industries, that makes people really nervous.""

Consumer spending came in softer than expected in last month, but overall sales continued to grow steadily amid mounting fears of an economic slowdown and inflation.

It's not just consumers who are concerned. Major companies, such as Walmart, Delta, and American Airlines, along with the Federal Reserve and Wall Street are all signaling uncertainty. The S&P 500 dropped 10% from record highs in February, suggesting investor fears over an economic slowdown.

Drafted in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest challenge, he said, was that a different company ""would blow up"" every week. It felt as if the writing ""was never over,"" said Ritholtz, the chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, an investment advisory firm that manages more than $5 billion of assets. By comparison, the new book was a ""joy"" to write, largely due to the benefit hindsight, said Ritholtz, who is also a prolific blogger and creator of the long-running finance podcast ""Masters in Business."" The book, ""How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors That Destroy Wealth — And How to Avoid Them,"" published March 18, is a history lesson of sorts. More from Personal Finance:

Take a look inside a $1.1 million 'zero emissions' home Ritholtz looks back at anecdotes across pop culture and finance — touching on Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, music sensations like The Beatles, and corporate pariahs like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos — to illustrate the disconnect between how much people think they know and what they actually know. (Ritholtz' point being, The Beatles and films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" were initially panned; Holmes, initially lauded, is now serving jail time.) ""It's a huge advantage to say, 'I know how the game ended,'"" Ritholtz said. ""What the analysts were saying in the second, third, fourth inning, they didn't know what they're talking about."" CNBC spoke to Ritholtz about why people are often bad investors, why famous investors like Warren Buffett are ""mutants,"" and why financial advice about buying $5 lattes is the cliché that just won't die. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

How to be 'miles ahead of your peer investors'

Greg Iacurci: Your No. 1 tip to being a better investor is to avoid mistakes — or, as you write, ""make fewer unforced errors."" What are some of the most damaging unforced errors you often see? Barry Ritholtz: Let's take one from three broad categories: Bad ideas, bad numbers and bad behaviors. Bad ideas are simply, wherever you look, people want to tell you what to do with your money. It's a fire hose of stuff. Everybody is selling you some bulls*** or another. And we really need to be a little more skeptical. On the numbers side, the biggest [mistake] is simply: We fail to understand how powerful compounding is. A lot of the dumb things we do get in the way of that compounding. Cash is not a store of value. It's a medium of exchange, and you shouldn't hold on to cash for very long. It should always be in motion, meaning you should be paying for your rent or mortgage with it, paying your bills and your taxes, whatever recreational stuff you want to do, whatever philanthropy you want to do and whatever investing you want to do. But money shouldn't just sit around.

watch now

Compounding is exponential. When I ask people, ""If I'd invested $1,000 in 1917 in the stock market, what's it worth today?"" You look at what the market's returned — 8% to 10%, with dividends reinvested — $1,000 a century later is worth $32 million. And people simply can't believe it. Ten percent [reinvested dividends] means the money doubles every 7.2 years. The biggest [behavioral error] is simply, we make emotional decisions. That immediate emotional response never has a good outcome in the financial markets. It is exactly why people chase stocks and funds up and buy high, and why they get scared and panic out and sell low. If you just avoid those three things, you're miles ahead of your peer investors.

Not all plays are 'Hamilton'

GI: Going back to something you mentioned about how relentless bad financial advice is, what are some memorably bad pieces of financial advice or investment opportunities you've come across? BR: I get a lot of weird things — plays, restaurants. You should know, most plays are not ""Hamilton"" and most restaurants are not Nobu. These are really, really difficult investments. Those are all the winners. You're not seeing the other million products in the same space that didn't make it. I think we have this really distorted viewpoint of the world that allows us to believe that finding a giant winner is much easier than it really is. And that is because you don't see the endless fails, the restaurants that implode, the plays that close after opening night. All these little investment opportunities that come along, and the people selling [them], the advice they're giving, they're always weird and quirky. A great restaurant is a really good business, but most restaurants are terrible businesses, and that's a hard thing for people to recognize.

The financial 'cliché that refuses to die'

GI: There's this great part in the book where you talk about the $5 coffee: The thought being, if you invest that money instead of buying coffee, you'll basically be a millionaire. You write that it's the ""cliché that refuses to die."" Why do you think it's detrimental for people to think this way? BR: $5, really? I don't want to come across as a completely detached one percenter, but if a $5 latte is the difference between you having a comfortable retirement or not, you've done something very, very wrong.

Let's say you do put $5 away. If you saved $5 every day and invested it, it adds up to something. But when you look out 20, 30, 40, years, the other side of the spending equation is, what's my income going to be? How much am I going to earn? If you're going to show me $5 compounding over 30 years, you also have to show me where my income is going to be. If I'm looking at this as a 30-year-old, what's my income going to be at 60? How will my portfolio, my 401(k) — and if I have kids, my 529 [college savings] plan — how will that have compounded over the same time? If you're only looking at the $5 latte but ignoring everything else — and that's before we even get to inflation — it looks like a chunk of money but it really isn't. The big philosophical problem that I've found is most of the spending scolds don't understand what the purpose of money is. GI: What is the purpose of money? BR: Money is a tool. First, lack of money certainly creates stress. You can worry about paying the bills, and if you have a kid, how am I going to pay for their health care? Not having sufficient money to pay the rent, buy food, pay for health care, is certainly stressful. The first thing money does is it chases away the lack-of-money blues.

Everybody is selling you some bulls*** or another. And we really need to be a little more skeptical. Barry Ritholtz",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/investors-will-be-miles-ahead-if-they-avoid-these-3-things-expert.html,cnbc
Social Security Administration delays timeline for new identity proofing policies following complaints,"A Social Security Administration (SSA) office in Washington, DC, March 26, 2025. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images

New updates to identity proofing policy

On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration said it is adjusting the policy in response to ""customers, Congress, advocates and others."" One of those adjustments is moving the date the new policy goes into effect to April 14. Importantly, the agency has also adjusted the policy so that certain vulnerable individuals — those applying for Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), Medicare or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) who are not able to use the agency's personal online accounts — will still be able to complete their claims entirely over the phone. When applying for retirement, survivor or spousal/children's benefits, individuals should first attempt to do so through their online ""my Social Security account,"" and if unable to do so online, they must visit a Social Security office to prove their identity and review their application.

To change their direct deposit information, Social Security beneficiaries should first attempt to do so through their online account. If online changes are not possible, they can visit a local Social Security office or call the agency at 1-800-772-1213 to schedule an in-person appointment. The Social Security Administration said it recommends individuals call to schedule an in-person appointment for applications for retirement, survivors or spousal or children's benefits where individuals are unable to apply online. The AARP, in a statement from chief advocacy and engagement officer Nancy LeaMond, said the updates are a ""good first step"" to respond to concerns about the new policy. ""Merely delaying the implementation of this change is not enough, though,"" LeaMond said. ""SSA should take a deliberate approach to its proposed changes to customer service that seeks public input, follows a clear communication plan and allows a reasonable timeframe for compliance.""

Callers to 800 number face long wait times

The swift policy changes come as the Social Security Administration's new leadership has come under scrutiny for its cooperation with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which the White House has tasked with slashing federal spending by cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse"" across government agencies. The Social Security Administration's acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, assumed the role in February after reportedly publicly disclosing he had been placed on administrative leave for cooperating with DOGE. Last week, Dudek threatened to shut down the agency in response to a federal judge's temporary restraining order that prevents DOGE affiliates from accessing sensitive Social Security data. He has since reversed his stance. As the agency's leadership has been in flux, many observers say they have noticed longer 800 number wait times. Because DOGE has a running list of Social Security offices it plans to close, it will be more difficult to visit an agency office in person, experts say. ""The customer service situation at Social Security has really declined in the past month or so,"" AARP's Sweeney said. The 800 wait times have ""skyrocketed"" since November, when they were at a low of about 11 minutes, Sweeney said. The average time to answer a call is 21.2 minutes, according to Social Security Administration data, while nearly half of calls are not getting answered.

Trump administration re-opens student loan repayment plan applications,"A person walks on campus at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S. March 26, 2025.

The U.S. Department of Education announced it is re-opening the online applications for income-driven repayment plans, the programs used by millions of federal student loan borrowers to repay their debt.

The IDR plans now available, according to the Trump administration, are: Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment.

The Trump administration took down the online applications for IDR plans earlier this year, prompting criticism from consumer advocates and borrowers.

At the time, the Education Department cited a February court order as its reason for pulling the applications. That was a decision from an appeals court in February blocking the Biden administration's new IDR plan, known as SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education.

However, the American Federation of Teachers sued the Trump administration this month, arguing that it interpreted the ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals too broadly by pausing the applications for other IDR plans beyond SAVE.

Congress created income-driven repayment plans back in the 1990s to make student loan borrowers' bills more affordable. The plans cap borrowers' monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.

Borrowers enroll in the plans not just for lower payments, but also to seek loan forgiveness under a number of different options.

Trump wants Small Business Administration to handle student loans. Here's what borrowers need to know,"People walk past the headquarters of the U.S. Small Business Administration in the Southwest Federal Center area on March 24, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images

President Donald Trump said last week that federal student loans would ""immediately"" be moved out of the U.S. Department of Education and will be managed by the Small Business Administration. ""They'll be serviced much better than it has in the past,"" Trump said of the debt. ""It's been a mess."" Consumer advocates expressed worries that the mass transfer of accounts to the SBA could trigger errors, or compromise borrowers' privacy. They also raised concerns about how a change in agency might affect protections, and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. While details on the president's decision remain thin, here's what we know as of now.

It's not clear Trump can move student loans

Trump said Friday that the SBA is ""all set"" to manage the country's $1.6 trillion outstanding federal student loan debt. More than 40 million Americans hold student loans. However, experts questioned the president's authority to move student loans out of the U.S. Department of Education. Financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz pointed out that The Higher Education Act of 1965 is ""very clear"" that the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office is ""responsible for student loans."" ""It will require an act of Congress,"" Kantrowitz said, to move the loans to the SBA. Similarly, the president alone can't abolish the Education Department. Only Congress can do so. Still, Trump signed an executive order earlier this month aimed at dismantling the agency. More from Personal Finance:

The 'danger zone' for retirees when stocks dip It's likely the president's student loan transfer effort will face legal challenges, along with his other moves to reduce the Education Department, said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. ""Borrowers don't know what to do"" for now, Yu said. ""There's a lot of uncertainty.""

'Every transition has gone very poorly for borrowers'

In the past, when federal student loan borrowers' accounts were transferred from one servicing company to another, they experienced credit report errors or had their information lost, Yu said. ""Every transition has gone very poorly for borrowers,"" she said. ""These are very sensitive records and many of these loans go back decades."" It is also worrisome that staff at the SBA with no prior federal student loan experience would be tasked with managing a complicated lending system with many different programs on which borrowers rely, including income-driven repayment plans, Yu said.

Adding to consumer advocates and borrowers' concern about Trump's proposed transfer was his administration's announcement earlier this month that the SBA's workforce would be reduced by 43% — leaving fewer people to manage this new responsibility.

Steps you can take now

One important thing for borrowers keep in mind: The terms and conditions of your federal student loans cannot change even if the agency overseeing them does, experts say. Your rights were guaranteed when you signed the master promissory note at the time your loans were originated. In anticipation of the transfer to the SBA, borrowers should gather the latest information on their student loan balance now, and keep an updated record of it, Yu said. At Studentaid.gov, you should be able to access data on your student loan balance and payment progress. If you don't know which company services your student debt, you can find that information on that site, as well.

"Over 9 million student loan borrowers past due after bills restarted, Fed estimates","People walk on the campus of the University of Southern California (USC) on March 21, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

Around 9.7 million student loan borrowers became past due on their bills after the Covid-era payment pause expired, according to a new estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

After the Covid-era pause on federal student loan payments lapsed in September 2023, the Biden administration offered borrowers a 12-month ""on-ramp"" to repayment. During that time, borrowers were shielded from most of the consequences of falling behind on their payments. That relief period concluded on Sept. 30, 2024.

By the end of the off-ramp period, the New York Fed estimates that the volume of past-due federal student loans hit 15.6%, with more than $250 billion in delinquent debt.

""According to these numbers, it is reasonable to expect student loan delinquency to surpass pre-pandemic levels when new delinquencies hit credit reports,"" the Fed's report says.

Trump pick to lead Social Security Administration faces questions on DOGE involvement,"Frank Bisignano testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination to be Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, March 25, 2025.

President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced senators' questions on Tuesday as to how involved he has been with recent changes at the agency under the Department of Government Efficiency.

The unofficial government entity known as DOGE has been tasked by the White House to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, including at the Social Security Administration, which provides benefit payments to millions of Americans each month.

"Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts are likely to raise prices, experts say: Here's one way you can still save thousands","If you're planning to buy a new car, be prepared to pay more.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported cars and key auto parts, effective April 3.

The new policy builds on earlier tariffs targeting Canadian, Mexican and Chinese goods by introducing a specific measure aimed at the auto industry. While additional tariffs are expected to be announced on April 2, the latest auto-specific tariffs will apply to nearly all foreign-made cars and components, regardless of origin.

Details are still unclear, but under the new policy, the tariff is expected to apply only to the non-U.S. content of imported vehicles — but without documentation proving U.S. content, the full value of the vehicle may be taxed, according to a White House fact sheet.

About 47% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, according to Edmunds. Even many American-made models rely on foreign parts, so the impact on prices is expected to be widespread. It's also likely that used car prices will rise, as they tend to follow the cost of new cars.

The average new vehicle transaction price is around $50,000 and tariffs could add thousands to the cost, says Ivan Drury, director of Insights at Edmunds. While the exact amounts aren't yet clear, prices rising ""well past $10,000 in some instances would not be out of the realm of possibility,"" he says.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/trump-announces-25percent-tariffs-on-imported-carshow-to-offset-the-costs.html,cnbc
Introvert: The No. 1 'most effective' tactic I used to become more outgoing—it improved my quality of life,"When Olga Khazan and her partner got serious about having a kid, she decided to make some changes —but not the kind typically associated with family planning, like saving more money or moving into a bigger home. The Virginia-based writer wanted to change her personality.

That's because child-rearing calls for patience and flexibility, qualities Khazan, 38, didn't feel she possessed in sufficient quantities.

While a CFP and real estate agent can help you fix your finances and find a bigger home, advice on improving your personality is harder to find. In her new book, ""Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change,"" Khazan writes that before making targeted efforts to cultivate a more positive mental outlook, she often ""snatched dissatisfaction from the jaws of happiness.""

One trait she was determined to change was the fact that, as an introvert, she often turned inward and stayed home rather than putting in the work to maintain relationships in the real world.

""For years I almost reflexively declined to socialize,"" she wrote. ""Even as I wallowed in the comfort of yet another 'Great British Bake Off' season, I wondered why I often had virtually no one to talk to, and why I relied so heavily on Twitter for social interaction.""

As a new mom, she wanted to be the type of person who was excited to engage with her kids and comfortable reaching out for help.

""Being a parent just requires being 'on' all the time,"" Khazan tells CNBC Make It. ""You kind of have to learn to be okay with being really active and socially engaged, even in a nonverbal way, a lot more than you're used to.""

Of the many exercises she tried, she found that one spurred the most change to her personality: It actually had her up and out of the house more often and engaging with other people.

'This is not me admitting failure': This 30-year-old founder returned to a 9-to-5 job after nearly 2 years of being her own boss,"When Cinneah El Amin was laid off from her tech job in 2023, she wasn't in any rush to get another corporate role. Instead, El Amin took it as a sign to go all in on her own business, Flynanced, which offers career and personal finance advice to ambitious working women. For the next year, she saw her ""corporate sabbatical"" as a time to grow as an entrepreneur. She put out new social media content, expanded her audience and booked deals with partners like TD Bank and Intuit Quickbooks. But by the spring of 2024, El Amin was burned out. So she made a decision a lot of startup founders might shy away from: to scale back on her own business and get another 9-to-5 job for steady income. ""This is not me admitting failure,"" El Amin says. ""This is just me redefining what success looks like for me.""

When entrepreneurship leads to burnout

For the 30-year-old, going back to working for an employer meant more job stability, a structured routine, better health insurance and a steady paycheck. She sees it as a form of self-care, one that also removes the pressure to monetize every ounce of effort that goes into Flynanced. ""It's a huge leap to go from having a brand alongside a 9-to-5 to that being your primary source of income,"" she says. The financial pressure pushed El Amin into overdrive on her business, which led to exhaustion and burnout. ""I was always thinking about the next sale, the next brand deal, she says, ""and it felt like I was moving away from why I started this, which is to help women with their finances and career journeys."" Ultimately, she adds, ""I felt like I couldn't really serve my community from that cup.""

Job searching tips after a break from the workforce

But El Amin was entering a job market that hadn't improved from the time she was laid off. For months she faced headwinds of low job openings and hiring activity, especially in her field of financial services. ""I can't lie, when I started my job search, I definitely felt a little bit of anxiety around, 'Will I really be able to find what I'm looking for?'"" El Amin says. She worried she wouldn't be able to match her old salary or keep a remote-first job. So she had to get strategic: El Amin got clear on the skills she was bringing to the job market as a technical product manager and about the types of jobs she wanted. She focused her search on companies in her previous industry, and she worked with a coach to nail down her career story — including all the things she learned during her career break and building Flynanced full-time. Her biggest lesson was learning to connect the dots and show how her entrepreneurship journey makes her a better product manager. ""Building an idea from concept through launch is very similar to working through the product management life cycle,"" she says. Another key takeaway: ""I didn't have to hide something that I have a lot of passion for,"" El Amin says. Mentoring other women on work and personal finance ""is something I like to do, the same way people have other hobbies outside of work that they don't hide."" That being said, El Amin says it was important to communicate that she could scale back her business to be a side hustle as she took on a new day job.

The LinkedIn trick that led to a job offer

After an ""aggressive"" and ""intentional"" search for several months, during which she estimates she applied to upwards of 300 roles, El Amin landed an offer as a senior product manager with the federal government in September and started her new job in October. She works fully remotely and feels fortunate to replace her previous six-figure income from working in the private sector. El Amin says she found her role using a LinkedIn trick to search for users' ""I'm hiring"" posts, rather than through the platform's jobs board. ""Going into federal government was not even on my radar,"" she says, ""and if that individual had not put out a post saying, 'Hey, this agency is looking for product managers,' I would have never found it.""

"Longevity doctor and mom: I never slack on my daily routine—here are my practices for a long, healthy life","When it comes to her own health and wellness, Desai, who is also a doctor of osteopathic medicine, follows the routines she typically suggests to her patients. From exercise and social connection to eating healthy foods and prioritizing sleep, ""every thing I'm doing, I want to optimize it,"" she says.

As an ER doctor for 20 years, Poonam Desai studied and incorporated daily practices for a long life well before it became her main focus. In 2017, she officially started practicing longevity medicine, helping her patients learn the tools they would need to build a routine that promotes living long and staying healthy.

CNBC Make It: What are some of the practices you do to keep your body healthy?

I really think that number one is sleep. It's something we do every single day. It's free. You have an opportunity to optimize it every single day. So I think sleep is my number one thing for longevity.

What I do particularly for sleep is making sure I go to bed around the same time almost every single day. People don't know that's probably one of the most important things you can do to help you develop a healthy circadian rhythm.

The next important thing is making sure that you expose yourself to sunlight, particularly before 10 a.m., and really decrease the amount of blue light in the evenings. One thing that I implemented in my bedroom is I took out all types of bright light, and I installed lamps that have red light. That really helps set the tone, and tells my body it's time to go to bed.

For exercise I've been using a weighted vest. Every time I go for a walk, I want to optimize that walk, because I don't have much time. I speed walk to increase my heart rate. I'm also strength-training by putting that weighted vest on, which is especially necessary because I am a mother and currently breastfeeding.

When you're breastfeeding and when you're postpartum, you actually may have about up to 20% of bone loss. I'm a woman in her early 40s. At least three times a week I do strength training to help me build my muscle.

I see a lot about brain health and how important it is for longevity. Are there any things you're doing specifically for your brain?

Sleep is number one and number two is nutrition. Just avoiding ultra-processed foods, avoiding additives, avoiding things that could be causing inflammation, is really important.

You really want to optimize things like leafy green vegetables, nuts, protein and omega-3s in your diet. One trick that I absolutely love and tell all my patients is to put chia seeds in your water. That's a great way to get a omega-3s, protein and even hydration. All of that is super important for your brain.

Another really important thing for brain health — that is not spoken about as often as it should — is the importance of connections. So I make sure that I do at least one or two things for social connection every single day.

You never want to go an entire day and not have a deep conversation with somebody, and that could be a friend, a loved one. Not everything should be so regimented, but that conversation that brings you joy and life and helps you feel connected is really important for brain health.

That actually leads directly to my next question. What's your social fitness like?

Oh gosh! Okay, so I'm a mom. I have a lot of interactions just by going to my daughter's school to pick her up. But I also always have a deep interaction with one friend every single day.

It could be literally calling my best friend from high school on my way to pick up my daughter or going for a walk. It could also be calling my aunt, my cousin, my grandma. It's as simple as that.

Sometimes the people may not live in close proximity, so a lot of my interactions — especially because I'm a working mom — happen over the phone. But I make sure to have one call a day with somebody that is close to me. It makes me feel connected.

That's really great advice. I also wanted to know what your daily diet is like. What are some of the foods you aim to eat daily or weekly?

I always start with fiber. Every single day I try to get at least 30 to 40 grams of fiber in my diet. Fiber comes from vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, and nuts — lots of fruits and vegetables.

One of my favorite ways to get fiber into my diet is to put a tablespoon of chia seeds in 30 ounces of water. I have a huge bowl of different fruits almost daily. It could be apples, oranges, kiwi, berries, blueberries, strawberries. I pair that with a lot of raw vegetables like raw cauliflower, raw broccoli and cabbage.

I try to do one serving of either lentils or beans per day. I'm vegetarian, so for me, I also can get fiber from the food I'm eating for protein as well. Second, is healthy fat, so omega-3s. I use olive oil a lot in my cooking, and eat things like avocados, nuts. I try to have at least one serving of those a day.

Then the third, protein. As a vegetarian, my protein usually comes from things like lentils, tofu, beans, legumes and eggs.

For longevity and diet, I am a big proponent of making sure we diversify our foods. I, particularly for me and my children, aim to have 60 different plant foods a week, and these plant foods could be fruits and vegetables, but don't forget about the nuts and the spices. If I'm making eggs, I'm throwing in rosemary or thyme or oregano, turmeric, black pepper. I really optimize the spices.

I'm really cautious about what I'm putting into my body, so I read every single label. If I'm going to have a cookie or a cupcake or ice cream, I make sure that I have fiber, protein or a healthy fat before to curb that glucose spike.

When it comes to drinks, water is always the best, but I kind of spice up all my drinks as well. I don't drink alcohol, but I make my drinks a little fun.

I'll have a matcha latte with oat milk. Another drink I love having, and I call it my immunity booster, has turmeric. I actually take the turmeric root and put it in there. It also has black pepper, ginger and lemon.

This next one is just for fun. What are you currently reading?

I read a lot of research and blog articles that pertain to longevity. Most of what I'm reading is about nutrition, wellness, hormones and longevity.

I even like to look at trending blog posts or trending Instagram Reels and LinkedIn articles. It's really important to know what everybody else is talking about.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/longevity-doctor-and-mom-my-practices-for-a-long-healthy-life.html,cnbc
"40-year-olds: We turned our daughter's lemonade stand into a pop-up restaurant that brings in up to $15,600 a month","Before Swetha and Venkat Raju launched their pop-up restaurant Brooklyn Curry Project, they helped their daughter set up a lemonade stand.

In May 2021, their daughter Mahati — 6 years old, at the time — wanted to set up a cash register and chalkboard signs to sell drinks and dosas outside the Fort Greene Park Green Market in Brooklyn, New York.

Swetha made masala dosas, a traditional South Indian crepe-like pancake made from fermented rice and lentils, for her daughter to sell. She watched as customers bit into them and widened their eyes in delight, and decided to sell dosas there every Saturday, she says.

A month in, she and Venkat arrived with butane stoves to cook more dosas in real time. By September 2021, hundreds of people lined up each Saturday, sometimes waiting for hours to buy $10 dosas, the couple says. The Rajus, both 40, now make and sell their dosas — now for $12 each — at a nearby commercial kitchen to keep up with demand, and host a seated lunch there once per month.

Brooklyn Curry Project's income fluctuates month-to-month, depending on the time of year and how many events the Rajus host. In June 2024, for example, the business brought in more than $15,600, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.

DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money

Over the full year, Brooklyn Curry Project brought in more than $8,100 in median monthly revenue, collected over Venmo. The business brings in some additional revenue in cash payments, and has a roughly 12% profit margin, Venkat estimates.

""In America, all Indian restaurants taste the same. The menus are all very stereotyped,"" he says. ""In India, the varieties and flavors are different and specific to their region. We missed that regional food scene.""

Swetha emigrated to New York from Bengaluru, India, for a job in 2016. Venkat and their two children followed a year later. It was an isolating, jarring experience, they say, so they started cooking as a family and inviting neighbors to their home for chai and biscuits.

""When I moved here, the biggest thing that hit me was I had to eat alone,"" says Swetha. ""It felt like some parts of our souls were missing.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/brooklyn-curry-project-how-indian-food-side-hustle-grew-from-lemonade-stand.html,cnbc

Husband-and-wife team Swetha and Venkat Raju started a South Indian dosa pop-up stand in Brooklyn, New York, while juggling full-time jobs and parenting two children. They started out cooking for their neighbors, closed their stand when the crowds became too large for the area and moved to a commercial kitchen in downtown Brooklyn.

"My 100-year-old Japanese aunt retired in her 90s—her 5 'hard rules' for a long, happy life: 'No smoking or red meat'","In Japan, there's a concept called ""Syojin,"" which translates to the devotion to living a humble life. This is something that many of my mentors have practiced, especially my aunt, who celebrated her 100th birthday in January. For as long as I can remember, she's always been a graceful, elegant and peaceful woman. As the chief priest and congregation leader of a Japanese shrine up until her early 90s, she has been a role model to many. Here are her five hard rules for a long, happy and meaningful life.

1. Live with gratitude

Every day without fail, my aunt says ""arigato"" (translates to ""thank you"") and ""kansha shimasu"" (""I am grateful""). She is grateful for her ancestors, religious community, spiritual practice and health. And she rarely complains. Her philosophy is that worrying does no good, and that everything happens as it should. She's taught me to stop wasting time and energy on things I cannot control. Every morning and evening, to reconnect with my roots, I pray to my ancestors, offering them incense and matcha. I also treat myself to a bowl of matcha and write in my journal about everything I am grateful for. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money

2. Don't take your food for granted

My aunt drinks green tea every day and eats a variety of vegetables, tofu and fish. No smoking or red meat. She always reminds me and the people around her to eat with mindfulness. That means chewing slowly, focusing on each bite and being grateful for what's on your plate. Yuzu is one of her favorite fruits. It's high in vitamin C and antioxidants, great for fighting inflammation, and also very soothing when put into a hot bath.

I love that she encourages us to learn the special recipes from our elders, and to thank the farmers who brought us the ingredients. I often make a hearty meal derived from a family recipe that I call ""longevity hot pot."" It has healthy ingredients and plenty of protein. Just combine the ingredients below and enjoy! Ingredients 3 cups dashi stock (or chicken broth)

1 piece of 2 x 2 inch kombu

2 pieces dried shiitake, soaked overnight (or fresh shitake)

4 cups of sliced napa cabbage

3 cups of seasonal greens, leeks and carrots

1 package of firm tofu (or a 3-ounce salmon fillet)

1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped ginger

2 tablespoons of dried seaweed

2 tablespoons of miso (or 1 tablespoon of soy sauce)

Glass noodles (optional)

One of my favorite meals to make is a hearty longevity hot pot. Michiko Tomioka

3. Build a community and be welcoming to everybody

""Genki-dene"" means ""be well and come again."" That is another significant part of my aunt's life philosophy. She cares about everyone around her. Family, friends, community members, strangers — she always wants them to feel at home. When she hosts, everyone is treated as an honored and beloved guest in her home. She offers them a cup of tea and good conversation. And you never leave her house without a bag of healthy goodies. That sense of solace you give and feel when you're being welcomed by a community is the key to longevity.

4. Accept your limitations

As we age, it can be hard to accept our weaknesses. But my aunt always tries to appreciate what she can do, and asks for help when she needs it. She frequently visits the local community centers and takes part in many activities. Three times a week, she walks up and down the stairs, takes baths and meets up with her religious study group. My cousin does much of the cooking for her now, but she still likes to help prepare some dishes and enjoys making the occasional Japanese-style omelet.

5. Find something to believe in

When my aunt was the chief priest at her shrine, she led an annual climb up a steep mountain in Nagano Prefecture. It was part of a ritual with her congregation members.

More than $1 billion in unclaimed tax refunds will vanish on April 15,"If you didn't file a tax return in 2021, time is running out to claim any refund you might be owed. If you owe the IRS money in a given year, you'll face stiff penalties if you fail to file a federal tax return by Tax Day. But if you fail to file when you have a refund coming to you, the agency typically doesn't pursue the issue. In most cases, you have three years from your original tax filing deadline to submit a return and get that refund. After that, it belongs to the federal government.

For tax year 2021, the three-year window closes on April 15, 2025. According to the IRS, there's still more than $1 billion in unclaimed refunds from that year, representing refunds due to over a million Americans. These outstanding refunds average about $780, but that's still money that will be reclaimed by the government unless delinquent filers take action.

Who is owed a refund from 2021?

The IRS estimates about 1.14 million people still haven't claimed their refunds.

How to file a 2021 tax return

April 15, 2025, is just a few weeks away, so time is running out to file a 2021 return — especially if you need to get ahold of older tax documents from companies you no longer get income from. Unfortunately, most tax-prep software programs don't allow you to file prior-year returns online. You would need to purchase and download the company's 2021 desktop edition, then print and mail in the completed return. If you create an account at IRS.gov, you should be able to access wage and income statements and transcripts of past returns. If you don't have Forms W-2, 1098, 1099 or 5498 for 2021, your employer should provide them. You can get returns or transcripts mailed to you, but that could take weeks. The IRS recommends that filers try other options first.

The Recovery Rebate Credit

2021 was also the last year that stimulus checks were sent out, so some overdue filers are owed additional money — up to $1,400 for individuals or up to $2,800 for couples filing jointly. The Recovery Rebate Credit also applies to qualifying dependents claimed on a tax return. A married couple with two dependents, for example, could qualify for as much as $5,600.

Tax refund FAQs What is the deadline to get a refund for tax year 2021? The IRS makes refunds available for three years, so the deadline to receive any money owed from tax year 2021 is April 15, 2025. How much are people who didn't file in 2021 owed? The average refund for outstanding 2021 filers is about $780. But they may also be owed the Recovery Rebate Credit, a refundable credit worth up to $1,400 for individuals who did not receive one or more Covid-19 stimulus payments. How many people are still owed refunds from 2021? According to the IRS, over 1.1 million Americans still have refunds waiting for them from 2021. The largest numbers are in California (116,000), Texas (102,000) and New York (73,000).

Robinhood CEO sees Amazon-like subscription model as path to 'loyalty' in financial services,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is betting that by rolling out a large enough portfolio of digital investment products, more consumers will be willing to pay a monthly subscription for its product suite.

Subscribers to Robinhood Gold pay $5 a month or $50 a year for perks like 4% interest on uninvested cash, access to professional research, and no interest on the first $1,000 of margin borrowed.

Now the company is adding wealth management features called Robinhood Strategies, which offers curated access to exchange-traded fund portfolios and mixes of handpicked stocks. The service, available to Gold Subscribers, carries a 0.25% annual management fee, capped at $250.

Robinhood also said this week that with its new Robinhood Banking offering, Gold subscribers will get private banking services with tax advice and estate planning tools, perks like access to private jet travel, five-star hotels and tickets to Coachella, and 4% interest on savings accounts. Customers will also soon be able to get cash delivered to their doorstep, saving them a trip to the ATM, though few details were provided.

Tenev told CNBC in an interview that Robinhood's subscription service could be similar to what users get from Amazon Prime or Costco membership, where their monthly fee feels justified by the quality and quantity of the perks, which keep them coming back.

""My philosophy behind it is subscriptions are about loyalty,"" Tenev said. ""So if you're a subscriber to something, then that service is sort of the first in mind when you think about trying something else from that category.""

Tenev said that in financial services, loyalty is particularly important because it's ""equivalent to wallet share.""

Tenev said the number of subscribers increased from about 1.5 million a year ago to 3.2 million today, adding that it's a ""nine-figure business,"" meaning at least $100 million in annual revenue.

Robinhood grew in popularity among younger investors by making it easy to buy and hold fractional shares in companies using a simple mobile app, and then moving into crypto. Tenev said on Thursday that over the longer term, Robinhood wants to be ""the place where you can buy, sell, trade, hold any financial asset, conduct any financial transaction.""

Robinhood shares are up 19% this year after almost tripling in 2024, when crypto prices soared.

"SEC will keep $50 million of Ripple fine and refund the rest to wrap case, legal officer says","Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have reached an agreement to end their long-running legal battle over allegations the company offered unregistered securities. Following last week's news that the SEC would drop its appeal without conditions, Ripple has now agreed to withdraw its cross-appeal, the company's chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said on X Tuesday.

The SEC will retain $50 million of the previously imposed $125 million fine — funds already held in an escrow account, Alderoty said. The remaining balance will be returned to Ripple.

Additionally, Alderoty said the agency will request that the court lift the standard injunction currently in place.

The resolution remains subject to a formal commission vote, finalization of legal documentation, and standard court procedures. Once completed, the case will be closed in full.

A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment or confirm the details of the deal.

This agreement marks the end of a closely watched, four-year legal battle that began in December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through sales of XRP.

Crusoe Energy sells bitcoin mining unit to focus on 'huge opportunity' in AI,"Seven years ago, the founders of Crusoe Energy set out to solve a dirty problem. Their mission was to take gas burned off by oil producers, convert it into electricity, and use that power to mine bitcoin . It turned into a good business.

But then came the artificial intelligence boom, and Crusoe co-founders Chase Lochmiller and Cully Cavness started to see a much bigger opportunity.

As the company focuses on AI and races to complete what it says could be one of most powerful clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs, in the world, Crusoe is getting out of bitcoin mining. The company said Tuesday that it's struck a deal to offload that operation to NYDIG, a power and financial services firm focused exclusively on bitcoin. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

NYDIG will take on about 135 Crusoe employees, who will continue operating the business under the new ownership. Crusoe will become a major equity holder in the combined entity — second only to Stone Ridge, NYDIG's parent company.

The deal includes Crusoe's technology that captures and converts flared gas from oil fields, and more than 425 modular data centers spread across seven U.S. states and parts of Argentina. Altogether, the operation accounts for roughly 1% of the world's bitcoin mining, according to Crusoe, which was valued late last year at $2.8 billion. NYDIG is also privately held and valued at about $7 billion.

Lochmiller told CNBC that Crusoe started investing in AI infrastructure it its earliest days, and that the business increasingly became a central focus.",2025-03-25 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/crusoe-energy-sells-bitcoin-mining-unit-to-nydig-to-focus-on-ai.html,cnbc
Affirm announces JPMorgan Chase merchants can soon offer installment loans at checkout,"Fintech lender Affirm said Tuesday that it's reached an agreement with JPMorgan Chase to offer its buy now, pay later loan services to merchants on the bank's payments network.

U.S. merchants who use JPMorgan to handle payments can soon add Affirm to their checkout pages, according to a release. Consumers will have access to loans ranging from 30 days to 60 months, according to Affirm.

The deal follows a similar announcement from rival Klarna last month, in which the Swedish fintech said it would be available to JPMorgan's merchants. Affirm and Klarna are increasingly going head-to-head as the buy now, pay later field matures in the U.S.; Affirm is publicly traded and seeking to steadily grow profits, while Klarna recently filed for a U.S. IPO.

""The demand for diverse payment options, flexibility, and seamless transactions from both merchants and their customers is at an all-time high,"" Michael Lozanoff, global head of merchant services at J.P. Morgan Payments, said in the release.

""By incorporating Affirm as a payment method into our Commerce Platform, we are empowering businesses to deliver the services they need and the experiences that customers increasingly expect as part of their retail journey,"" he said.

Affirm said the deal was an expansion of existing banking and processing relationships with JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets. It wasn't immediately clear when the new option would be available to merchants.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that JPMorgan merchants will soon be able to offer Affirm installment loans at checkout. A previous version misstated the timing of that offering.",2025-03-25 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/affirm-jpmorgan-chase-merchants-installment-loans.html,cnbc
Trump Media shares jump on announcement of ETF deal with Crypto.com,"Shares of Trump Media jumped about 9% in extended trading on Monday after the parent of the president's social media company announced an agreement with Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds and related products.

The company, which runs the Truth Social platform, has been hammered by investors so far this year despite President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Prior to the after-hours gain, the stock was down 38% in 2025.

In the press release on Monday, Trump Media said the ETFs and exchange-traded products will have a ""Made in America"" focus and will launch later this year, subject to regulatory approval. It's President Trump's latest foray into crypto, after his family introduced several Trump-branded non-fungible tokens and memecoins and announced plans to start a crypto bank of sorts.

The announcement also further blurs the line between the president's business ventures and his policy agenda.

Trump is the majority owner of Trump Media, which has a market cap of about $4.6 billion. It's a tiny and money-burning business. Trump Media last month reported losing $400 million in 2024, while taking in $3.6 million in revenue.

Much of the work in bringing the new ETFs to market will fall to Crypto.com and its U.S. affiliate, Foris Capital, a familiar arrangement for Trump, who has long allowed other companies to develop products with his name and brand.

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek, in the statement, touted access to a ""brand with a loyal following.""

The funds will be marketed under TMTG's newly-launched fintech brand, Truth.Fi. According to the press release, the crypto exchange will ""support the backend technology, provide custody, and supply the cryptocurrencies for the ETFs,"" which are set to include a unique basket of digital assets like bitcoin and cronos (Crypto.com's native token), alongside traditional securities spanning industries such as energy.

If the ETFs launch, they'll be available internationally, including in Europe and Asia, on major brokerage platforms and via the Crypto.com app, which boasts 140 million users globally.

"As Binance works toward redemption, CEO says Trump has been ‘fantastic’ for crypto","Binance CEO Richard Teng says the Trump administration has been a ""fantastic"" reset for the cryptocurrency industry.

""It's an extremely different environment that we're operating in,"" Teng told CNBC on Tuesday.

In the span of 16 months, Binance has gone from a political outcast to a possible power broker in Washington. Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump's second administration, Teng said.

""We've benefited from this shift,"" said Teng, who was appointed Binance's CEO in November 2023.

Teng's comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. That same day, Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto bank that has not yet launched, is engaged in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin.

If such deals were reached, it would mark a staggering reversal for a company that was once a pariah in Washington.

Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports.

""I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports,"" said Teng, who runs the exchange's operations outside the U.S.

As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred.

"".US and .com are quite different animals, right?"" he said. ""They have different sets of shareholders, different boards of directors, and different CEOs running the show.""

Binance structured the two exchanges as independent entities in response to regulatory scrutiny, aiming to ring-fence its U.S. operations from the broader international business.

Still, Teng is bullish on what the new political environment means for crypto.

""We went from four years of Operation Choke Point 2.0 to now – you have a very pro-crypto, pro-AI president,"" he said. While Binance.com doesn't operate in the U.S., he said, ""We have benefited from all these pro-crypto policies.""

Choke Point 2.0 is how industry insiders refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms during the Biden administration.

Teng described a rapid global expansion that brought Binance from 170 million to 265 million users in just one year.

""We have received a lot of approaches from different governments around the world,"" Teng said, citing regulatory progress in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.

Binance is now licensed in 21 jurisdictions, and its influence extends well beyond the reach of any one country. That includes sovereign wealth funds, some of which are starting to quietly allocate to crypto, Teng said.",2025-03-23 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/binance-ceo-says-trump-has-been-fantastic-for-cryptocurrency.html,cnbc
"After a college football career and 2 failed House races, Bo Hines is helping steer U.S. crypto policy","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as Crypto czar David Sacks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets Bo Hines attend the White House Crypto Summit at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 7, 2025.

Bo Hines has no professional background in crypto. He earned his law degree three years ago from Wake Forest. He's twice unsuccessfully run for Congress in North Carolina.

Now the 29-year-old former football player is wrapping up his second month as one of the leaders of President Donald Trump's crypto agenda.

""We're well on our way in delivering on the President's promise to welcome in the golden age for digital assets,"" Hines told CNBC in an interview this week. ""And make the United States the crypto capital of the planet.""

Hines is repeating a high-level message Trump has been uttering since the waning months of his campaign last year, when he became the crypto industry's clear choice to run the country. Hines is working under former venture capitalist David Sacks, who Trump tapped to be the first White House AI and crypto czar.

Hines said he and Sacks are working ""hand in glove"" to not only rewire crypto regulation, but to do it quickly.

""The president's given us the authority to do that,"" Hines said. ""He trusts his advisors.""

Hines played wide receiver for North Carolina State's football team, and has said his interest in digital assets began as far back as 2014, when he played in the BitPay-sponsored Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl. N.C. State beat the University of Central Florida by a touchdown in the game, and Hines caught three passes.

Hines went to Wake Forest to pursue a law degree. He explored regulatory issues related to crypto and became a retail investor. He then turned his attention to public office, losing campaigns for Congress in 2022 and 2024.

But along the way, in the 2022 primary, Hines won the endorsement of Trump, who called the candidate a ""proven winner both on and off the field"" in a news release from his Save America PAC.

In late 2024, Hines was tapped by President Trump to lead his Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Now, he's tasked with helping steer national crypto strategy, under Sacks, with a promise to ""move at tech speed.""

Hines said much of the group's early work has focused on dismantling what industry insiders call ""Operation Choke Point 2.0."" It's how they refer to an alleged crackdown by legacy banks on digital asset firms.

""They were victims of lawfare for the last four years,"" Hines said, referring to the Biden administration. ""These are people that are doing nothing but helping our American economy grow.""",2025-03-21 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/bo-hines-is-ex-football-player-steering-americas-crypto-strategy.html,cnbc

"Klarna lands buy now, pay later deal with DoorDash, notching another win ahead of IPO","Klarna is synonymous with the ""buy now, pay later"" trend of making a purchase and deferring payment until the end of the month or paying over interest-free monthly installments.

Klarna, the buy now, pay later lender that's headed for an initial public offering, said on Thursday that it's signed on DoorDash as a partner, another sign of momentum for public market investors.

It's DoorDash's first BNPL alliance in the U.S. and gives users of the restaurant delivery service a new way to pay for meals and products. Klarna said in a press release that DoorDash customers will be able to pay in full at checkout, split payments into four equal interest-free installments, or defer to dates that align conveniently with payday schedules.

Klarna, which is headquartered in Sweden, filed its prospectus last week to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue last year increased 24% to $2.8 billion, and adjusted operating profit was $181 million, swinging from a loss of $49 million a year earlier. CNBC reported on Monday that Klarna will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for OnePay, the Walmart-backed fintech company.

""Our partnership with DoorDash marks an important milestone in Klarna's expansion into everyday spending categories,"" said David Sykes, Klarna's chief commercial officer, in Thursday's release.

Klarna, founded in 2005, said in its prospectus that it has 675,000 merchant partners in 26 countries. It's among the most hotly anticipated IPOs of the year following an extended stretch of historically little activity for new offerings.

Trump's World Liberty Financial crypto project says it sold $550 million in tokens,"President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial crypto project said on Monday that it raised $250 million in its second token sale, bringing the total amount of coins sold to $550 million.

WLFI, a venture backed by the first family that describes itself as a sort of crypto banking platform, launched in October, weeks before Trump's election victory. In a document published at the time of launch, WLFI said the Trump family could take home 75% of net revenue.

In Monday's release, WLFI said more than 85,000 participants underwent so-called know-your-customer verification to gain access to the token sale. Co-founder Zach Witkoff, son of billionaire U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, is quoted in the release as saying that ""WLFI is on track to supercharge DeFi,"" or decentralized finance.

In January, Tron blockchain founder Justin Sun upped his stake in WLFI tokens to $75 million. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the SEC were exploring a resolution to the regulator's civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur.

WLFI is one of several crypto projects in the Trump family that are kicking off just as the president is pushing a crypto-friendly agenda. Earlier this month, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

According to a memo from the White House last week, David Sacks, the Trump administration's AI and crypto czar, sold over $200 million worth of digital asset-related investments personally and through his firm, Craft Ventures, before starting the job. Sacks said in a podcast that he ""didn't want to even have the appearance of a conflict.""

At the end of February, the SEC declared that meme tokens are not securities. The announcement came after the president and First Lady Melania Trump launched their own meme coins in the days leading up to the inauguration.

Block bets on lending expansion after stock slump,"In this photo illustration, the logo for the US tech firm ""Block"" is displayed and reflected in a number of digital screens on March 03, 2023 in London, England.

With its stock down more than 30% this year and revenue growth slowing, Jack Dorsey's Block is going bigger in lending.

The company on Thursday said it secured approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to originate loans through its banking subsidiary, Square Financial Services, allowing it to offer small-dollar consumer loans directly rather than relying on external banking partners.

It's an expansion of Cash App Borrow, the company's short-term lending product. But it comes at a time of increased concerns surrounding consumer credit, with President Trump's expansive tariffs and widespread government job cuts raising talk of a potential recession.

Transaction losses in Block's lending segment jumped 39% last quarter, and while the company claims its underwriting model is strong, small-dollar lending is inherently risky.

""Cash App Borrow is designed to provide short-term cash flow in a simple and accessible way when alternatives are notoriously expensive and difficult for consumers to navigate,"" Block said in the press release. The company added that the average Cash App Borrow loan was under $100 and about a month in duration.

Block didn't immediately provide a comment.

In getting approval to operate the lending business out of its own bank, Block says it will be able to offer the product nationwide.

Last month, Block reported quarterly results that missed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing just 4.5% from a year earlier. The stock plunged 18%, its worst one-day drop since 2020.

Around the same time, Block rolled out Afterpay, its buy now, pay later product, on the Cash App card. Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC that the launch aimed to provide customers with more credit options, and positioned Cash App as a banking alternative for some customers. Block acquired Afterpay, which competes with Affirm , for $29 billion in early 2022.

Also this week, Block announced a big investment plan in artificial intelligence.

The company said on Wednesday that it will deploy Nvidia's AI systems with its latest Blackwell chips to power open-source AI research. Block didn't say what specifically it's looking to achieve through its AI buildout, but noted in the press release that it will ""start exploring novel solutions for our customers.""

"David Sacks sold $200 million in crypto-related holdings before taking White House job, ethics memo says","U.S. President Donald Trump sits next to Crypto czar David Sacks at the White House Crypto Summit at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 7, 2025.

David Sacks, the Trump administration's AI and crypto czar, sold over $200 million worth of digital asset-related investments personally and through his firm, Craft Ventures, before starting the job, according to a memo from the White House.

Of the the assets sold, the documents said that at least $85 million ""is directly attributable to Sacks."" The memo, from White House counsel David Warrington, added that Craft remains an investor in some other funds that have digital assets in their portfolios.

The disclosure, dated March 5, is 11 pages long, compared to the two-page document from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly installed secretary of Health and Human Services. Sacks' divestments mark a stark contrast to the behavior of others in the administration, and follow the first Trump term, during which conflicts of interest were routinely disregarded.

President Trump, in addition to his many real estate assets, currently maintains a major stake in Trump Media & Technology Group , the publicly traded parent of Truth Social, and has launched multiple crypto projects that can rise or fall in value based on various government policies. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who also controls SpaceX, social media company X and AI startup xAI, is in position, as one of the president's top advisers, to shape regulations in a way that potentially favor his businesses.

Three days before his inauguration, President Trump launched a memetoken dubbed $TRUMP through his company, CIC Digital LLC, which owns 80% of the coin's supply. The Trump family also receives 75% of proceeds from a separate crypto bank launched last year called World Liberty Financial.

Musk, meanwhile, who is heading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, counts on government contracts, particularly at SpaceX. The company, for example, has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office to build a network of spy satellites.

Beyond Trump and Musk, reports indicate that several cabinet members hold substantial investments in various cryptocurrencies. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who recently departed his role leading Cantor Fitzgerald, has reportedly made hundreds of millions of dollars from its ties to tether.

"Toast, Shift4 lead drop in fintechs as investors exit stocks tied to consumer spending","A screen displays the company logo for Toast Inc. during the company’s initial public offering at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City on Sept. 22, 2021.

Economic concerns are hitting the stock market broadly, but they're having an outsized impact on fintech companies that are tied closely to consumer spending and small and medium-sized businesses.

While the Nasdaq fell 2.1% on Thursday, putting the tech-heavy index on pace for its worst week since September, shares of Shift4 , Toast and Bill.com suffered much steeper drops, losing 6.7%, 6.2% and 4%, respectively.

President Donald Trump's disjointed rollout of his trade policy, most notably with threats on tariffs that change by the day, has rattled markets this month. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that the Trump administration is more focused on the long-term health of the economy, adding that he's ""not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.""

Fintech stocks tend to be more volatile than traditional banks and lenders, as investors jump in when risk tolerance is high and exit when the mood turns more conservative. Barclays predicts that President Trump's higher tariff policies could lower U.S. GDP and raise inflation in the near term, resulting in an additional interest rate cut this year.

Shift4, which provides payment processing technology, has dropped 19% this year after Thursday's slide, almost double the losses in the Nasdaq and more than triple the percentage decline for the S&P 500. The stock sank 17% on a single day in February after the company issued a forecast that trailed analysts' estimates.

At the same time as its earnings report, Shift4 announced that it was buying payments platform Global Blue for an equity value of $1.5 billion, which is equal to about one-fifth of Shift4's current market cap. Analysts at DA Davidson lowered their price target on Shift4 after the deal to $124 from $140 ""to reflect the acquisition integration and financial leverage risks.""

Toast, whose payments technology is popular in restaurants and cafes, has had a dismal month, falling 15% so far in March, compared to the Nasdaq's 8% decline. The company reported better-than-expected results in February, but the stock fell anyway.

Following a doubling in market cap last year and a big swing to profitability, analysts at Piper Sandler said Toast now has the ""challenging task of topping 2024.""

The competitive fintech landscape is leading to increased scrutiny around margins and growth sustainability. Affirm , whose buy now, pay later loan products face heightened competition, dropped almost 4% on Thursday, bringing the stock's loss for the year to 23%.

Bill.com provides spend and expense software to many small businesses. The company has struggled to regain footing after a brutal post-earnings selloff that saw the shares plummet 36% on weak guidance.

Binance token rises following report that Trump family has discussed stake in the crypto exchange,"The Binance logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen.

Binance's BNB token bucked the wider crypto downturn on Thursday, jumping 4% following a Wall Street Journal report that the Trump family has held talks to secure a financial interest in the U.S. arm of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Such a deal would notably link the Trumps to a firm that pleaded guilty to breaking anti-money laundering laws in 2023.

According to the Journal, Binance first approached Trump allies last year, pitching a deal that could help the embattled exchange regain its footing in the U.S. At the same time, its founder, Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — has been angling for a presidential pardon after serving four months in prison for violating anti-money laundering laws.

However, in a post on X, Zhao denied any discussions about a deal for Binance.US or seeking a pardon.

""Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong,"" he wrote. ""I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with… well, anyone.""

Zhao said the article was part of a broader effort to attack both crypto and the current administration, claiming that ""the residual forces of the 'war on crypto' from the last administration are still at work.""

Crypto payments company MoonPay looks to compete with Stripe with Iron stablecoin acquisition,"Now, with Iron, MoonPay can offer businesses the ability to accept stablecoin payments, unlocking instant, low-cost, and borderless transactions.

Already, MoonPay makes it easier for people to participate in the new crypto economy by enabling onboarding through most traditional payment rails, including debit cards, bank accounts, PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

""We think everyone is going to have a digital currency wallet, whether it's inside of a bank account or independently. And we build a backwards compatibility to the existing financial system,"" MoonPay Co-Founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in an exclusive interview.

This marks MoonPay's second significant acquisition in two months, underscoring its ambition to dominate the rapidly growing stablecoin payments market.

Crypto payments giant MoonPay is expanding its push into the enterprise market with the acquisition of Iron, an API-first stablecoin infrastructure startup.

Soto-Wright compared the acquisition to when PayPal bought Braintree, which handles credit card processing for companies like Meta and processed nearly $600 billion in total payment volume last year.

""This is our Braintree moment,"" said Soto-Wright. ""Iron's technology positions MoonPay to become the definitive infrastructure provider for enterprise stablecoin solutions.""

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to real-world assets, and in 2024 alone, most of the $27 trillion transferred through stablecoins consisted of digital dollars moving seamlessly across blockchains.

Soto-Wright likened the deal's potential impact to the transformation seen in telecommunications.

""It was really expensive to place a long distance phone call, and then you had Skype, then you had Zoom, you had all this internet-based technology for doing communication — same thing will take place for money, and that's essentially the blockchain,"" he said.

This marks MoonPay's second major acquisition this year, following its $175 million purchase of Helio in January.

Businesses across the financial services landscape, from legacy banks to startup payment providers, are adopting stablecoins or exploring launching their own. Stablecoins make it easier and cheaper to switch between currencies and to move money digitally. Standard Chartered predicted in a recent report that stablecoins could grow to become about 10% of foreign exchange transactions, up from 1% today.

MoonPay's purchase comes one month after Stripe closed its $1.1 billion deal to buy a different payment infrastructure company called Bridge Network, the largest deal both for Stripe and the crypto ecosystem more broadly.

Bridge makes it easier for businesses to accept stablecoin payments without having to directly deal in digital tokens. Customers include Coinbase and SpaceX.

MoonPay, which has more than 30 million accounts in 180 countries, was last valued at $3.4 billion when it raised its last round of funding in 2021. The company tells CNBC it is cash-flow positive and profitable and that net revenue increased by 112% in 2024 from a year earlier.

""We think it is an internet-driven payment method you'll see all across the world,"" Soto-Wright said."" ""If you think about the United States, we have been a little bit behind. Real-time payments has taken years to get rolled out. We actually think wallets can help skip that technology jump and stablecoins are going to be a very important part of that.""",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/moonpay-pushes-further-into-enterprise-with-iron-stablecoin-acquisition.html,cnbc
"How Lead Bank CEO Jackie Reses rose from 'a pretty gritty childhood' to Goldman Sachs, Square and top of U.S. fintech","Jackie Reses got an early start on the entrepreneurial life.

During what she describes as a ""pretty gritty childhood"" in Atlantic City, she and her brother ran carnival games on a Jersey Shore boardwalk, one of which (flukey ball), she says, ""I think is now illegal.""

""I think the thing that really drove me was my own desire to succeed and make sure that I had the security that I could create for myself, and so I felt that self-reliance and that entrepreneurial background really is what drove me,"" Reses told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in a Changemakers Spotlight video interview.

Reses was named to the inaugural CNBC Changemakers list in 2024.

From those first, quick, easy-to-set-up ""all cash"" game successes, Reses went on to run custom t-shirt and taxi businesses in college.

The business plans got more complicated after that, but the successes got bigger also, starting with Wharton and an early career at Goldman Sachs, where Reses says many of her leadership principles were set.

She helped Square to grow into the closest thing the tech sector has ever had to an actual bank, building it ""from the ground up, first line of code, first policy,"" she said.

That experience led Reses to want to own a bank, a goal she accomplished in 2022 when she bought a community bank based in Kansas City, Missouri, and transformed it into the current Lead Bank, which now also provides infrastructure to fintech companies.

""One of the problems I've seen is that fintechs, over the last 10 to 15 years, have put a beautiful sheen on the front end of an app to make financial services easier. And I think we've all felt that with fintech apps that we use; the infrastructure, however, is terrible,"" Reses said.

A big test for how good that fintech infrastructure could become arose during Covid, when Reses reached out on behalf of Square to then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to recommend a role for fintechs in disbursing emergency government funds to small businesses, just as the Treasury and Small Business Administration were putting in place the initial ideas for what would become the Paycheck Protection Program — an experience she now describes as ""stressful but incredible.""

""Square helps the food trucks, the barber shops, the restaurants, as do other fintechs, and we had a way to get to them that most large banks really didn't. And so at that point in time, I had this idea that we should call the Treasury Secretary,"" she recalled.

""It was probably one of the most intense life experiences I've ever had. We had to build a product in two weeks that was one of the biggest lending programs ever created to serve Main Street America,"" she added.

Reses has never shied away from a tough assignment, and that paid off in a very big way before her fintech years when she was tasked by then-employer Yahoo to serve on the Alibaba board, in an effort to repair what she describes as ""a toxic relationship"" mired in ""mistrust.""

She ended up hammering out a deal that gave Yahoo a 15% stake in the Chinese internet giant that would ultimately be worth $40 billion after the company's IPO. ""It was an extremely acrimonious relationship between the leadership of Yahoo and the ownership of Alibaba,"" she recalled.

Building trust between Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, the rest of the executive team at Alibaba, and the Yahoo board and management team, was not easy, but Reses says coming in with new ideas and none of the existing corporate baggage helped. ""I didn't have any of the personal animus that was there prior to my showing up on the board of Alibaba. And I think with a fresh pair of eyes, I was able to say, 'Let's start over.'""

Reses has started over many times since her independent life began, she says, at the age of 14, when she was sent to boarding school. And she has learned many lessons along the way about starting companies, leading companies, and moving on to the next big idea.

"Fintech stocks plummet as Wall Street worries about consumer spending, credit","People wait in line for T-shirts at a pop-up kiosk for the online brokerage Robinhood along Wall Street after the company went public with an initial public offering earlier in the day on July 29, 2021 in New York City.

It was a bad day for tech stocks, and a brutal one for fintech.

As the Nasdaq suffered its steepest decline since 2022, some of the biggest losers were companies that sit at the intersection of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

Stock trading app Robinhood tumbled 20%, bitcoin holder Strategy fell 17% and crypto exchange Coinbase lost 18%. Much of the slide in those three stocks was tied to the drop in bitcoin , which fell almost 5%, continuing its downward trajectory. The price of the leading cryptocurrency is now down 19% over the past month, falling after a big postelection pop in late 2024.

Beyond the crypto trade, online lenders and payments companies also fell more than the broader market. Affirm , which popularized buy now, pay later loans, dropped 11%, as did SoFi , which offers personal loans and mortgages. Shopify , which provides payment technology to online retailers, fell more than 7%.

JPMorgan Chase fintech analysts on Monday highlighted declining consumer confidence as a potential challenge for companies that rely on consumer spending for growth. In late February, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index slipped to 98.3 for the month, down nearly 7%, the largest monthly drop since August 2021. Walmart recently reported a shift away from discretionary purchases, underscoring the potential trouble.

""Our universe has modestly outperformed the S&P 500 since the election, but sentiment has soured of late on declining consumer confidence and signs of slowing discretionary spend,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote.

Trump's first White House Crypto Summit has VIPs pushing for favorable laws,"Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, slammed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also said the cryptocurrency exchange is looking to invest more outside of the U.S. Carlos Jasso | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Now that President Trump has announced plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, crypto industry leaders can focus on what else they want to hear from the new administration on Friday. Just over six weeks into his second White House term, Trump is hosting his first Crypto Summit, a nod to an industry that played a major role in his election victory in November. No executive was more central to that effort than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Once a Silicon Valley entrepreneur focused on onboarding the world to digital assets, Armstrong has spent the last year transforming himself into crypto's ambassador in Washington, D.C., funneling millions into elections, building alliances, and ensuring the digital currencies market has a seat at the table. ""My goal in attending this is really just, first of all, to thank President Trump for helping make the United States the crypto capital of the world,"" Armstrong told CNBC ahead of the meeting. ""I think he's lived up to that campaign promise so far, and we've seen a lot of work getting done here in a positive way."" Joining Armstrong at Friday's summit, which is being led by White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will be Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov, among others. They're planning to discuss digital asset regulation as well as the mechanics of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump announced late Thursday by way of executive order. Armstrong, whose company helped the crypto sector raise and direct $250 million into the 2024 election cycle, outpacing Wall Street banks and the oil industry, has been instrumental in shaping the new administration's approach to digital assets. Crypto's push to unseat opposition lawmakers and install pro-crypto candidates paid off handsomely, flipping key seats and cementing the sector as a major political force in Washington.

Several million dollars were funneled directly to Trump's campaign and inaugural fund, a sign of just how much was riding on his victory. At Friday's summit, Armstrong says his top priority will be pushing forward new laws. ""From our point of view, the next step in the United States that's the most urgent is getting legislation passed,"" he said. He specifically pointed to stablecoin regulation and broader market structure reforms. Momentum for regulatory clarity is already shifting in crypto's favor. The Senate this week voted, with strong bipartisan support, to overturn two Biden-era regulations that the industry opposed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, called the wins a gateway for more comprehensive legislation.

Crypto's wish list

For Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a key issue is how the U.S. can use blockchain technology to maintain its dominance in global finance. ""Really what matters for financial systems is assets,"" said Nazarov, whose company provides a blockchain-based platform for digital assets. ""Does the U.S. generate the largest collection of the best base assets that are then wrapped, rewrapped, and repackaged by others? That's how I define global leadership of a financial system in this new model."" Nazarov said the U.S. must ensure that key financial markets – treasuries, investment funds, and real estate – are tokenized. He sees that as the defining financial shift of the next 50 years, similar to the move from paper-based markets to internet-based financial products.

Robinhood's Tenev has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for tokenization, arguing that blockchain technology can democratize private markets and break down barriers to investment in the world's most valuable companies. In a Washington Post op-ed, he pointed out that companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe are worth hundreds of billions of dollars combined but remain inaccessible to everyday investors, with profits concentrated among a small group of insiders. ""Crypto technology can unlock new ways to trade and invest in all assets, from digital to real-world,"" he told CNBC ahead of the event. ""Tokenization will transform investing, but we need regulatory clarity to make it happen."" Under current SEC rules, only accredited investors, people with over $1 million in net worth or $200,000 in annual income, can participate in private markets. Tenev says that reforming these outdated rules and creating a security token registration framework would level the playing field for retail investors, giving them access to high-growth opportunities that have long been reserved for venture capitalists.

Prior to Thursday's executive order, the big debate in the industry was what kind of strategic reserve Trump would propose. The announcement ends speculation over whether the reserve would include multiple cryptocurrencies. While Trump's initial post on Truth Social named five tokens — bitcoin, ether , XRP , Solana's SOL token and Cardano's ADA coin — the final order limits the reserve to bitcoin. SOL, ether and bitcoin all fell around 5% late Thursday, while ADA plunged nearly 12%. The order marks the U.S. government's first formal recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. The reserve will be funded exclusively through bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring taxpayers bear no financial burden. Non-bitcoin assets will be placed in a separate Digital Asset Stockpile managed by the Treasury Department. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures said the decision cements bitcoin's status as a global asset, ""somewhere in the realm of gold."" Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley, who will also be at Friday's summit, called the development ""a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage."" ""By holding bitcoin and other digital assets for the long term, the White House is taking a future-forward approach to bolstering American economic competitiveness — not just for the decade ahead, but for the next century,"" said McCauley.

The bitcoin audit

For David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and one of the key figures credited with influencing Trump's embrace of bitcoin, the priority is understanding the size of the country's bitcoin ownership. ""One is to figure out how much bitcoin America holds, and what we can do as an industry to help the government secure it,"" he said. The Treasury Department must now conduct a full audit of the government's holdings, estimated at 200,000 bitcoin. Sacks confirmed that the government will not sell any bitcoin from the reserve, positioning it as a permanent store of value. Bailey, who convinced Trump to keynote the biggest bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville in July, is also pushing for bitcoin-backed Treasury bonds, arguing that integrating bitcoin into the U.S. debt system could strengthen the country's balance sheet and attract more buyers. ""If we mix bitcoin reserves with U.S. bonds, we could create significant demand by giving investors exposure to bitcoin's performance,"" he said. Armstrong told CNBC that Coinbase would ""absolutely"" step up to be a crypto custodian for the government in the context of a national reserve, adding that the company already works with various parts of the government on crypto custody and trading. ""We're always happy to continue doing that,"" Armstrong said.

Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said the reserve will send a strong message to institutions that bitcoin is here to stay. ""We're also seeing that this is going to be the mirror image of a lot of corporations that have looked at their treasuries and started to invest in bitcoin,"" he said, pointing to Saylor and Strategy as early adopters. ""I think this will spark a whole new wave of confidence in the asset, both from corporations and the U.S. government."" Saylor's company has amassed a roughly $43 billion stash of bitcoin, accounting for almost all of its market cap. ""I think this executive order is well considered and auspicious for the United States, the crypto industry, and bitcoin,"" Saylor told CNBC. The move faces some pressure from Democrats. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sent a letter to Sacks ahead of the meeting, raising conflict-of-interest concerns and questioning whether Sacks had advance knowledge of Trump's Truth Social post that initially floated a multi-coin strategic reserve. Warren called on Sacks to disclose any financial holdings in bitcoin, ether, solana, and other assets included in the reserve, noting that his firm, Craft Ventures, was heavily invested in these tokens through Bitwise as of Jan. 1. She also pressed for public disclosure of his government ethics filings, which, as an unpaid special government employee, he has to file but isn't required to make public. Sacks said this week on X that he sold ""all my cryptocurrency and my crypto-focused funds"" before joining the administration. After the summit, many of the attendees will regroup at an off-the-record event hosted by Coinbase, along with invited members of the administration. Armstrong is gearing up to play the long game. ""The fight for crypto here is more urgent than ever,"" Armstrong said. ""If the U.S. leads on this front, I think the rest of the G20 could be pretty inspired by it, and that has a lot of domino effects downstream.""",2025-03-07 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/trumps-first-crypto-summit-has-attendees-ready-to-push-for-regulation.html,cnbc
Trump signs executive order establishing U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating a strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a major shift in U.S. digital asset policy.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote in a post on X that the reserve will be funded exclusively with bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring that taxpayers bear no financial burden.

According to estimates, the U.S. government controls approximately 200,000 bitcoin, though no full audit has ever been conducted. Trump's order mandates a comprehensive accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of bitcoin from the reserve, positioning it as a permanent store of value.

Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department, to hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies.

Many crypto investors who have supported Trump raised concerns over the weekend after the president said in a post on Truth Social that in addition to bitcoin, ether , XRP , Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin would be part of a strategic crypto reserve.

""I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve,"" bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss wrote. ""Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar and that digital asset is bitcoin.""

SOL, ether and bitcoin all fell around 5% late Thursday, while ADA plunged nearly 12%.

Ahead of the announcement, Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter told CNBC that the U.S. committing to a bitcoin-only reserve would ""ratify bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold.""

""The U.S. is clearly the most important nation in the world, and so their stamp of approval really does a lot for bitcoin,"" Carter said, noting that including any digital currencies other that bitcoin would have made it look like another speculative fund.",2025-03-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/trump-signs-executive-order-for-us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve.html,cnbc

"Pro-Trump techies enraged by president's crypto reserve announcement, causing early rift","David Sacks, U.S. President Donald Trump's ""AI and Crypto Czar"", speaks to President Trump as he signs a series of executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 23, 2025 in Washington, DC.

The Trump-tech alliance is showing its first real sign of distress. And it's because of crypto.

President Donald Trump counted on crypto execs and investors for a hefty portion of his 2024 campaign funds. He promised to reward them handsomely if elected by slashing regulations and by turning the U.S. into ""the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.""

The president got off to a quick start, signing an executive order calling for the establishment of a working group on digital assets and pardoning Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. The SEC also dropped its yearslong probe into Coinbase .

While those moves were lauded by the most vocal techies who backed Trump's candidacy, over the weekend the president took it a step too far in their view. In a post Sunday on Truth Social, Trump announced the creation of a strategic crypto reserve for the U.S. that would include not just bitcoin but several other digital currencies — ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token and Cardano's ADA.

For the most part, Trump's crypto backers all wanted a strategic bitcoin reserve. Such a move would entail using cash to buy bitcoin, which is widely viewed by crypto enthusiasts as a smart way to deploy capital into a decentralized currency that's an alternative to hard money. As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote on X, bitcoin offers a ""clear story as successor to gold.""

By going well beyond bitcoin, the critics say, Trump would be using U.S. taxpayer money to buy much riskier assets that have unproven value and have the potential to bolster the net worth of a select few investors who own the coins. That's all the more problematic to those who want to axe government spending by trillions of dollars, in support of Elon Musk's cost-cutting mission at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

""Taxation is theft,"" wrote Joe Lonsdale, founder of venture firm 8VC and a vocal Trump supporter, in a post on X. ""It should be kept to a minimum. It's wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it's also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.""

David Sacks, the venture capitalist who was tapped by Trump to be the White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar, took exception to Lonsdale's comment, suggesting it's premature to jump to any conclusions. Sacks and Lonsdale are part of the same conservative circle in the tech world, with Musk and Peter Thiel at the center.

""Nobody announced a tax or a spending program,"" Sacks wrote, in response to Lonsdale's post. ""Maybe you should wait to find out what's actually being proposed.""

The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",2025-03-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/pro-trump-techies-enraged-by-crypto-reserve-plan-causing-early-rift.html,cnbc

"Block's 28% plunge in February leads fintech sell-off, while Stripe shows benefit of staying private","Patrick Collison, chief executive officer and co-founder of Stripe Inc., left, smiles as John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Studio 1.0 television interview in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, March 23, 2018.

Stripe has once again shown why sometimes it's better to be private.

During a February sell-off for fintech stocks, Block plunged 28%, its steepest decline since 2023, alongside drops of 20% or more for PayPal and Coinbase and a 8% slide in shares of SoFi . Meanwhile, Stripe on Thursday announced a tender offer for employee shares at a $91.5 billion valuation, making the payments company significantly more valuable than any of its public market peers.

""In general, they benefit from being private because there's a handful of stocks that people want to buy and they trade at a premium to public valuations,"" said Larry Albukerk, founder of EB Exchange, which helps facilitate trades in shares of pre-IPO companies.

He said Stripe is part of an exclusive group of private companies, along with SpaceX, Anthropic and Anduril, which are all seeing sky-high demand from investors.

""For every one of those, there's 100 companies that don't get that kind of premium,"" Albukerk said.

The Collison brothers — Patrick and John — founded Stripe in 2010, a year after Jack Dorsey started Square, which is now part of Block. Crypto exchange Coinbase and online lender SoFi were both launched after Stripe.

While all of those companies went the traditional route of raising large amounts of capital from prominent venture capital firms, only Stripe has chosen to stay private. To relieve some pressure for liquidity, Stripe regularly allows early investors and employees to sell a portion of their stake. The tender offer this week marks a 40% increase from a year ago and gets the company close to its peak valuation of $95 billion that it reached in the frothy days of the Covid pandemic.

""We are not dogmatic on the public vs. private question,"" John Collison, the company's president, told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin this week, adding that Stripe has ""no near-term IPO plans.""

Stripe's peers have all had to report quarterly results of late, and it's created a hefty dose of volatility and some concern. Last week, Block reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that missed analysts' expectations, pushing the stock down 18%, its third-worst one-day drop on record.

PayPal shares tumbled even though the company blew past estimates and issued better-than-expected guidance. Coinbase topped expectations with revenue soaring 130%, powered by a post-election spike in crypto prices. Coinbase was a leading contributor to Republicans' sweeping victory in November in its effort to help push forward a more crypto-friendly agenda in Washington, D.C.

But Coinbase fell earlier this week to its lowest price since just before the election, tumbling in tandem with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",2025-02-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/block-plunge-in-february-leads-fintech-selloff-stripe-valuation-jumps.html,cnbc
Stripe's valuation climbs to $91.5 billion in secondary stock offer,"Stripe announced a tender offer for employees and shareholders on Thursday that values the payments startup at $91.5 billion, the closest the company has been to its peak valuation of $95 billion in 2021.

""We very much care about providing good liquidity for employees and existing shareholders,"" Stripe co-founder and President John Collison told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview on ""Squawk Box.""

As for the company's long-awaited public market debut, Collison said, ""We are not dogmatic on the public vs. private question,"" and ""have no near-term IPO plans.""

Stripe also revealed in its annual letter on Thursday that it generated $1.4 trillion in total payment volume in 2024, up 38% from the year prior. The company said it was profitable in 2024, and expects to remain so this year.

Collison said the business can't be managed on a ""super tight quarterly EPS basis because this growth tends to come in waves.""

Stripe ranked third on CNBC's Disruptor 50 List for 2024, jumping from the 28th position in 2023.

Collison said the artificial intelligence boom has been key to the company's recent growth. High-profile AI startups OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity and Mistral are all Stripe clients.

""Unlike maybe previous booms that were more speculative in nature where you had asset price speculation, here we are seeing an AI boom that is very real,"" Collison said. ""There's a bunch of companies that have grown and grown and grown over the past few years, but they've grown because they have real revenue and they have real revenue because they have customers that find their products really useful.""

More than 700 AI agent startups launched on Stripe last year, according to the company's annual letter. Collison said a future where agents will make purchases for human customers is inevitable.

Founded in 2010, Stripe has regularly conducted tender offers to allow early investors and employees to sell a portion of their equity in order to reduce the pressure to go public. A year ago the company announced a tender offer at a $65 billion valuation.",2025-02-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/stripes-valuation-climbs-to-91point5-billion-in-secondary-stock-sale-.html,cnbc
Block's Bitkey rolls out bitcoin inheritance fix for 'multibillion-dollar problem waiting to happen',"Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter Inc., speaks during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, U.S., on Friday, June 4, 2021.

For over a decade, bitcoin has been lauded as a revolutionary financial asset — decentralized, self-sovereign and resistant to confiscation — all contributing to an astronomical increase in value.

But one problem has remained largely unsolved: What happens to your bitcoin when you die?

While traditional financial institutions allow for the seamless transfer of stocks, mutual funds and retirement plans, bitcoin’s self-custodial nature makes inheritance and estate planning inherently thorny. Coinbase requires probate court documents and specific will designations before releasing funds, while physical wallets offer little to no support, potentially leaving all that digital value stuck on a private key.

Jack Dorsey's Block says it's created a fix, and the company is now bringing it to market.

In November, Block's Bitkey self-custody bitcoin wallet introduced an inheritance feature that lets users set a beneficiary for their bitcoin holdings, creating a simple system for transferring the digital currency in the case of death. The feature is being rolled out on Wednesday.

""A lot of people have significant amounts of bitcoin at this point, or appreciating bitcoin, that's sitting in a place where it's not going to get to their loved one,"" said Jason Karsh, who joined the company in July and is now Bitkey’s head of business. ""It's just kind of a multibillion-dollar problem waiting to happen that we're hoping to solve by making it super easy to recover in the case of your death.""

Karsh said that with other bitcoin storage products, beneficiaries typically have to provide extensive legal documentation. And hardware wallets often require a user to store seed phrases in a way that exposes their bitcoin to unnecessary risks.

Bitkey is one of the remaining pieces of Dorsey's crypto strategy at the company he originally started as Square. The same month that Block announced the inheritance product, the company said it was winding down its unit called TBD, which was created in 2021 to focus on bitcoin. TBD was designed to be Block's platform for developers in an effort to create a more decentralized, secure and private internet.

In shuttering TBD, the company said it would still be investing in Bitkey as well as a bitcoin mining initiative, while continuing to allow users to buy bitcoin through the Cash App.

Unlike traditional crypto exchanges that profit from holding user funds, Bitkey makes money through hardware sales and, potentially, transaction fees. The Bitkey device is a self-custody bitcoin wallet that users purchase to store their private keys securely.

For the inheritance offering with Bitkey, the company lets the user create a separate key for the beneficiary that's uploaded to Block's servers. The beneficiary has no access to the key until six months after the owner dies. The funds will then be securely transferred to the beneficiary’s own Bitkey wallet.

Beyond Bitkey, Dorsey said in the company's latest earnings report that Block expects to deliver its first bitcoin mining chips this year, and is ""building the infrastructure to scale faster, investing in next generation chip design and mining systems.""",2025-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/blocks-bitkey-rolls-out-fix-for-bitcoin-inheritance-problem.html,cnbc

PayPal lays out strategy for Venmo to reach $2 billion in revenue in 2027,"At PayPal 's first investor day in four years, CEO Alex Chriss will deliver a clear message to shareholders: Venmo isn't just an easy way to split the dinner tab.

Chriss, who took the helm in September 2023, is trying to spur a turnaround at the payments company, and Venmo is a key part of his effort. The company told investors in New York on Tuesday that Venmo can top $2 billion in revenue by 2027. The last time PayPal provided an annual revenue figure for Venmo was 2021, when it was about $900 million.

For Chriss, Venmo expansion is all part of a broader push to restore consistent, profitable growth after years of turbulence that saw the company's market cap dwindle by more than 80% from mid-2021 through late 2023.

With 90 million U.S. users, Venmo has been a cultural staple for years and has become a verb that's synonymous with sending money to a friend or family member. But monetization has remained a challenge because those transactions generate little revenue.

Meanwhile, competitors like Block 's Cash App, Zelle and Apple Pay have been gaining ground, offering simple bank integrations and an expanded range of financial services. On Tuesday, PayPal is outlining its strategy to deepen user engagement and position Venmo as the default app not just for peer-to-peer transactions, but for spending, saving and becoming what the company is calling the ""go-to money movement app.""

That includes more focus on its debit card, encouraging in-store purchases, getting more merchants to use ""Pay With Venmo"" and rolling out features designed to keep funds within the app. Ultimately, greater business use means higher transaction volume and more profit. And for consumers, offering them increased value within the app raises the likelihood they'll use Venmo to pay at checkout and to keep higher balances in their account.

The company has already been headed down that path. Monetized monthly active users increased 24% in 2024, and the company expects mid-single-digit annual growth in Venmo's user base through 2027. Over that stretch, Venmo debit card total payment volume is projected to rise at a more than 20% compounded annual growth rate, while ""Pay With Venmo"" is expected to expand at double that rate.

Chriss has prioritized transaction margin dollars, reversing a decline that saw margins contract in 2022 and 2023 before rebounding in 2024. At investor day, he's outlining long-term financial targets, including high single-digit growth in transaction margin dollars and per share earnings growth in the low teens by 2027.

To push Venmo beyond the consumer market and into the world of business transactions, PayPal has partnered with companies including DoorDash , Starbucks and Ticketmaster. In its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this month, PayPal said the number of merchants using Pay with Venmo increased 50% from a year earlier.

The company said Instacart and MoonPay joined as partners in the latest quarter and that JetBlue became the first airline to allow use of Venmo for booking flights.

""While we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers,"" Chriss said on the earnings call. ""This gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond.""",2025-02-25 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/paypal-strategy-for-venmo-to-reach-2-billion-in-revenue-in-2027.html,cnbc
"These tech stocks have 40% upside as long as there’s no recession, says HSBC","Software stocks could be a good hedge for investors looking for some stability against an increasingly volatile macroeconomic backdrop and unstable market, according to HSBC. Mounting uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff rollouts and fears of a weaker economy have rattled markets for the past five weeks, sending all three major averages down for the year. Many companies with more operations overseas and higher imported inputs have cut the financial guidance they give Wall Street, further shaking investors' confidence in the profit outlook. While London-based HSBC sees the macroeconomy taking a hit, the bank does not expect a U.S. recession. ""HSBC economists expect U.S. real GDP growth to moderate to 1.9% in 2025 vs 2.8% in 2024 but do not expect a recession,"" Stephen Bersey, HSBC's head of U.S. technology research, wrote in a recent note. ""Our own analysis indicates that the bulk of the short-term weakness could be attributed to actions taken by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and tariff concerns. However, over the medium term the DOGE steps could be viewed positively for companies in our coverage as they may allow lower corporate and personal tax rates, higher U.S. economic growth, lower inflation and lower interest rates."" Going forward, Bersey believes software stocks could be an efficient hedge if the bull market corrects itself following this recent pullback. In the report, Bersey highlighted several technology stocks as potential buys, each with potential upside of more than 40% to his price target. ""The software sector has become much less cyclical than in the past due to a sector-wide transition towards a subscription-based revenue model with long term, contracted, revenue commitments that provide better predictability to future revenues,"" Bersey wrote. ""Thus, if the macroeconomic weakness does indeed turn out to be a temporary effect of DOGE (as we think plausible), we see a minimal short-term impact on contracted revenue and medium-term underlying demand remaining strong."" A few of the stocks Bersey underscored are shown in the table below, alongside their HSBC price targets and potential upside, as of the time of the report. Amazon , the dominant e-commerce platform and parent of Amazon Web Services, was one name Bersey highlighted. The analyst's $280 price target implies potential upside of about 43% from last Friday's close. Shares of Amazon have shed nearly 12% this year, but are about 8% higher over the past 12 months. ""While tariff-driven macro uncertainty and DeepSeek likely played their part, we believe that, fundamentally, not much has changed,"" Bersey wrote. ""Though operational comps are starting to get tougher, we remain confident that Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on returns from its past strategic investments."" Bersey added that a return to normalcy should boost growth in Amazon Web Services. Fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" member Microsoft was another on HSBC's list. The tech titan has similarly slipped 9% in 2025 but more than 11% over just the past three months. Bersey believes analysts are not fully pricing in the potential growth from Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform. ""Our FY27 revenue and non-GAAP EPS forecasts are 16% and 20% ahead of consensus,"" he wrote. ""We believe the consensus is underestimating the company's ROI yield from Azure investment."" Bersey's $598 price forecast implies shares of Microsoft could rally roughly 53% from current levels. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Tech could see a rebound soon. How to play it while hedging against potential downside,"March Madness (in markets) is hopefully coming to an end. Investors have endured the worst performing months in quite some time as the Magnificent Seven was acutely repriced. I believe April presents an opportunity to own technology after the leading sector recently dipped into correction territory. I want to use the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) to produce an income stream as I have optimism on a rebound in tech. .MAG7 3M mountain CNBC Mag-7 Index 3-mo chart Several factors have contributed to the revaluation of the Mag 7. Tariffs were generally pointed to as the catalyst for the indiscriminate selling, yet investors must recall the overbought conditions of the Mag 7. These tech stocks collectively have had a parabolic move higher. For example, Meta had a twenty consecutive day run in February pushing the stock up to $740 in before retracing and trading under $575 in March. Twenty consecutive days of gains had never happened before, unusual times for sure. Despite the pop in volatility, I have turned positive again on technology, and the premise of this bullish trade is predicated on the fact that we will resolve the persistent trade tariff headwind. However, since volatility is elevated with the VIX around 20, I want to define my risk in the event the Mag 7 decides to take another leg down. Selling a put spread will allow an investor to collect significant premium while the technology sector tries to find some footing in April. The trade Sold the April 17 $210 XLK at-the-money put for $6 Bought the April 17 $205 XLK out-of-the-money put for $2.75 This credit spread allows an investor to collect $3.25 per spread or $325 An investor must be prepared to own XLK at $206.75 and will possibly have a max loss of $1.75 or $175.

"Barclays upgrades Ferrari, sees attractive entry point after recent pullback","A recent correction has opened up an attractive entry point for Ferrari lovers, according to Barclays. Analyst Henning Cosman upgraded shares of the luxury car manufacturer to overweight from equal weight. U.S.-listed shares of Ferrari are flat for the year, but they have tumbled more than 8% this month. They tumbled around 16% from a February peak after shareholder Exor had announced it would sell up to 4% of Ferrari stock. ""We had downgraded RACE to EW post FY24 results following strong performance — but now we see good entry point again,"" Cosman wrote. RACE-IT 1Y mountain RACE-IT 1Y chart A major catalyst also comes from Ferrari confirming its guidance in the face of President Donald Trump's Wednesday announcement that he would slap a 25% tariff on ""all cars that are not made in the United States."" This guidance confirmation serves to reaffirm Ferrari's strong pricing power and low margin sensitivity, especially illustrating its strong relative resilience versus other European competitors. ""Yesterday's guidance confirmation underscores unique (relative) safe-haven status and is a strong sign of confidence amid great uncertainty in EU Autos,"" the analyst added. ""Namely, RACE said that based on current information [of 25% additional tariffs on US imports of foreign-made cars], it will partially reflect the new import conditions through pricing, up to a maximum 10% increase, except for models imported before April 2, 2025 and for orders of the 296, SF90 and Roma, regardless the import date."" Meanwhile, Ferrari has already confirmed six model launches for 2025, which could serve as further catalysts for the stock. Ferrari shares ticked more than 1% higher in the premarket following the upgrade. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Jefferies upgrades this chip stock due to low China exposure compared to peers,"Applied Materials has a leg up over competitors, according to Jefferies. The bank upgraded the semiconductor manufacturer to buy from hold. Analyst Blayne Curtis also lifted his price target to $195 from $185, implying upside of roughly 32% from Thursday's close. Curtis pointed to Applied Materials' attractive valuation as a catalyst for the upgrade. He added that the stock is a leading beneficiary of spending growth in DRAM, or the dynamic random access memory type of storage capacity. Applied Materials also has the lowest China exposure among the big three U.S. semiconductor companies, meaning it could potentially better hedge President Donald Trump's tariffs than its competitors. AMAT 1Y mountain AMAT 1Y chart ""Leading Edge and DRAM beneficiary and March guidance brings China exposure to the lowest in the group. Currently trading at the cheapest in the group,"" Curtis wrote. Curtis added that Applied Materials could also benefit from U.S. semiconductor nationalization trends — that is, an initiative to move supply chains back to domestic shores. He underscored the company's dividend increases and stock buybacks as an additional catalyst, alongside its market share gains in certain subindustries. Shares of Applied Materials have slipped 9% this year, and are now down 28% over the past 12 months. Analysts are generally bullish on the stock. Of the 35 who cover Applied Materials, 26 have a buy or strong buy rating, LSEG data shows. The average price target also implies upside of 40% going forward.

CNBC.com reported on Thursday that Igor Taber, a top executive at Cortical Ventures, said ""At its core, CoreWeave is a reseller of GPUs -- so they buy infrastructure from companies like Nvidia, and then they rent out those GPUs to customers. Their gross margin is significantly below what you would typically expect from a pure software company.""

"These three stocks are beating Nvidia and have room to run, Victoria Greene says","Nvidia has lost some of its luster as a market leader, but other big name stocks are now outperforming the semiconductor giant and could have further upside. Shares of Nvidia, the chipmaker that drove the market higher in 2023 and 2024, have struggled over the past three months, falling more than 8% in six months. Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer of G Squared Private Wealth, joined CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Thursday to discuss three stocks she likes that have outperformed Nvidia over that same period. Walmart One stock that is in a recent slump, but still outperforming Nvidia, is Walmart . Shares of the country's largest retailer are up more than 7% over the past six months. However, the stock is trading around $86 per share, down from $104 in February before it gave soft earnings guidance . WMT 6M mountain Walmart stock is down since mid-February, but still positive over the past six months. Green said that Walmart looks like ""a great place to hide out"" despite that outlook. ""I see this consolidating here and pushing back up. I see this stock back at 100 easily, and if anybody's going to weather tariffs it's going to be Walmart,"" Greene said. Altria Another stock that is outpacing Nvidia is tobacco company Altria , up 14% over the past six months, excluding its fat, 7% dividend. Greene pointed out that the stock trades at a cheap price-to-earnings ratio relative to the overall market and that the company is looking to be more than just a tobacco firm. ""It wants to be everything to help stimulate you, calm you, relax you,"" Greene said. Shares of Altria were trading at about $58 on Thursday. Greene said that 65 or 70 per share is ""absolutely in its future."" Netflix The top performer of the three stocks highlighted by Greene is Netflix , which has gained 38% over the past six months. Greene said that Netflix could become a $1500 stock, equal to an increase of more than 50% from where shares traded Thursday. Netflix should be in a strong position even if the economy weakens, according to Greene. ""Even if you're beginning to have to reduce your budget, you're going to keep Netflix in there because they're so good at pricing,"" she said.

"These ‘emerging dividend aristocrats’ have been growing their payouts for years, says Wolfe Research","Investors looking for safety and income amid the market turbulence may want to turn to dividend stocks. Equities have had a rocky year so far as investors grapple with the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs and concerns about the economy. Stocks fell again on Thursday after the latest tariff-related news aimed at foreign automakers. While dividend stocks may help smooth the ride, not all are created equal. One preferred strategy from Wolfe Research focuses on so-called dividend aristocrats , which are companies that have boosted their payouts in each of the past 25 years. The stocks have historically performed well heading into and during recessions, analyst Chris Senyek said in a note Monday. ""They have also been the top and most consistent performing dividend theme in the year after the Fed's first rate cut,"" he wrote. For investors looking to get a jump on the next potential names to earn this distinction, Senyek looked for companies he believes may be ""emerging Aristocrats."" The names have increased their dividend for at least 15 years. Here are some that made the cut. Verizon has a 6.13% dividend yield and has grown its payout by 2% in the last 12 months. The wireless carrier said in September it will acquire fiber-optic internet provider Frontier Communications in an effort to expand its fiber network. The stock has an average analyst rating of overweight and about 3% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet. Investors can get paid to wait on Nike , which has 2.43% yield but has underperformed this year. The company posted an earnings and revenue beat for its fiscal third quarter last week, but warned sales declines for the current quarter would be in the mid-teens range. NKE YTD mountain Nike Nike has an average analyst rating of overweight and nearly 21% upside the average price target, per FactSet. Meanwhile, shares of Philip Morris have soared this year, thanks to the popularity of its smoke-free products , notably its Zyn oral nicotine pouch. The tobacco giant, which yields 3.5%, plans to ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free alternatives. Philip Morris posted a first-quarter revenue and earnings beat in February, with its smoke-free products exceeding 40 billion units for the first time. In January, the Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of Zyn, the first nicotine pouches to receive authorization. ""It was a great quarter, great year and, more importantly, we see the same sort of dynamics going into 2025,"" CEO Jacek Olczak said in an interview with CNBC's "" Money Movers "" in February. PM YTD mountain Philip Morris There may be volatility around tariffs and currency fluctuations, but the company's fundamentals are strong, he added. The company has a last-12-month dividend growth of 3%. However, its quarterly dividend has increased by 193.5% since 2008, Philip Morris said in its 2024 annual report, released Thursday. The stock has an average analyst rating of overweight but 2% downside to the average price target. Several financial firms also made the cut, including Prudential Financial , which has a 4.67% dividend yield. It has an average analyst rating of hold and 9% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet. Lastly, investors can grab a 4.19% dividend yield in Bristol Myers Squibb . It grew its dividend by 5% in the last 12 months. The pharmaceutical giant said last month that it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by the end of 2027 by streamlining operations and making organizational changes. It also posted an earnings and revenue beat for its fourth quarter, but its full-year guidance disappointed. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

"Buying Nvidia right now is a 'particularly attractive opportunity,' Bank of America says","There is an end in sight to Nvidia' s recent rough patch, and that means now could be a plum buying opportunity for shares of the artificial intelligence darling, according to Bank of America. ""[W]e believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a Wednesday note. The firm's buy rating and $200 per share price target imply nearly 76% upside from Wednesday's close. Shares have pulled slipped more than 15% so far in 2025. March has been especially difficult for Nvidia, which is off nearly 9% during the period as jittery investors shy away from last year's Big Tech high flyers. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia stock in 2025. One of the major near-term headwinds lingering over Nvidia stock is the May 15 compliance deadline for the AI diffusion rule. The framework, first introduced in the final days of the Biden administration, is meant to control global AI development by limiting the export of chips from companies such as Nvidia to an approved list of countries. An industry group representing firms such as Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft has urged President Donald Trump to loosen some of the rules before the deadline. However, the effect that the still unknown final ruleset has had on Nvidia stock may have been overblown, Bank of America's Arya said. He expects the stock to rebound sharply once some clarity is provided by the Trump administration. ""Once the geopolitical concerns are sized and priced, we expect NVDA to recover, much like the relative recovery we have seen in semicap stocks this year once China exposure was reflected in wafer fab [wafer fabrication] equipment spending,"" he said.

"Josh Brown says don't buy this auto stock dip: ""I think the pain continues'","Thursday's sell-off in auto stocks may look tempting to investors who are used to buying the dip. However, Josh Brown warns the worst isn't over for the sector — and to avoid exposure. Major carmakers declined Thursday after President Donald Trump announced his plans to impose a 25% tariff on ""all cars that are not made in the United States,"" effective April 2. General Motors dropped around 6%, while Ford and Stellantis pulled back 2% and 1% each. Within the 14 publicly traded companies in the auto manufacturer industry trading on the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange, five companies are trading significantly below ""every moving average — and that list is growing,"" Brown told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Thursday. He highlighted Rivian, Tesla, Lucid, Ford and General Motors as the struggling names. Traders often look at moving averages on charts to determine long term trends. ""Usually when you have stock sell off like this, you can lean back on the fundamentals; You could say. ...I think this is overdone. You can't say that here,"" said Brown. ""Out of those 14 auto manufacturer names, five of them are not even profitable on a net income basis,"" Brown added. ""So I think the pain continues."" Brown advised investors who currently have exposure to auto stocks to reduce their exposure in the case of a short-term relief rally. ""If you get an opportunity because Trump speaks out of the other side of his mouth, and these stocks catch a 6% plus, 7% relief rally, I would use it,"" Brown said. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

"An insurance stock is primed to outperform during this market instability, charts suggest","Shares of Prudential Financial (PRU) have been in a consistent downtrend phase for the last three months, bringing the stock down from a peak around $128 in November 2024 to a low earlier this month around $105. A recent bounce has brought PRU back up to test a confluence of resistance, suggesting an impending breakout could lead to much further gains for this insurance name. A trendline formed from the November 2024 and January 2025 swing highs lines up remarkably well with this week's price action, currently sitting just above the $115 level. We can also see that Wednesday's rally saw PRU push briefly above its 200-day moving average for the first time since early February. This week's upswing also brings Prudential back up to retest its most recent swing high in late February, meaning a break above current levels would create a higher high and suggest a new uptrend phase. Price momentum, as measured by the RSI, is starting to demonstrate more bearish behavior, with the most recent rally propelling the RSI above the crucial 60 level. We can see that previous upswings in January and February saw the RSI top out before it reached the 60 threshold, indicating that this most recent rally could indicate an influx of buying power with the potential to drive even higher. Finally, we can see that the rally off the March low created a bullish momentum divergence, with the lower lows in price matched with higher lows in RSI. Lower price action on stronger momentum suggests an exhaustion point in the downtrend phase, which often leads to a new impulse move higher. On the weekly chart of Prudential, we can observe that the most recent low around $105 lines up very well with previous major lows in August 2024 and April 2024, as well as a previous all-time high from Q1 2022. The weekly RSI features a bearish momentum divergence from the first half of 2024, which provided a signal for the impending top and new downtrend that has occurred into 2025. Finally, we can see that the weekly PPO has not yet indicated a bullish reversal, although a signal does appear to be likely in the near future. The last time we saw a bullish signal from this indicator was back in June 2023, just before PRU powered higher all the way to the eventual high in November 2024. With mega cap growth stocks experiencing further pressure this week, we are finding plenty of compelling technical opportunities in value-oriented sectors like financials. Given the potential breakout and long-term trend reversals discussed today, Prudential Financial could provide an opportunity to outperform in a period of market instability. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

Understanding options 'skew' and how to use it to your advantage trading stocks or bitcoin,"Options skew refers to the difference in implied volatility (IV) across various strike prices or expiration dates for options on the same underlying asset. It reflects the market's perception of risk and the demand for specific options, often indicating how traders anticipate potential price movements. Typically, skew arises because out-of-the-money (OTM) options — puts or calls — can exhibit higher or lower implied volatility than at-the-money (ATM) options, depending on market conditions and sentiment. When the implied volatility for out-of-the-money (OTM) calls exceeds that of OTM puts, it is referred to as ""positive skew"" or ""call skew."" This signifies that the market anticipates a higher probability of substantial upward movement in the underlying asset or that volatility is likely to increase as the underlying price rises. It is typical for assets where significant upward movements are expected or can occur during extreme market stress, such as commodities facing short-term supply shortages or demand surges like natural gas or electricity. This phenomenon is also observed in growth stocks. When implied volatility is higher for out-of-the-money (OTM) puts than for OTM calls — a common occurrence for most stocks and stock indices — it may suggest that investors are buying puts for downside protection and/or selling upside calls to collect option premiums or that investors expect the volatility of the underlying asset to rise as the price falls, or, when looking at an index that additionally correlations may increase, which can contribute to higher volatility of an index relative to the volatility of the constituents of it. This phenomenon is known as ""negative"" or ""put skew."" Implied volatility skew often leads to a situation where, if an investor is interested in employing vertical spreads, the relative attractiveness of the risk-reward could appear quite asymmetric. For example, if someone considers buying a call spread in SPDR S & P 500 Trust (SPY) for a bullish bet, the risk/reward relationship may seem less appealing than purchasing a put spread. Consider the following two examples. SPY closed at $568.59 on Wednesday. If an individual is inclined to bet that it might fall 5% within the next 30 days, they could buy a May 30th expiration 568/540 put spread for approximately $7.15, just over 25% of the difference between the strikes. SPY YTD mountain SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust, YTD The potential payoff of nearly $21 is almost three times the price of acquiring it. The peak profit ratio would be roughly 3:1. The May 30 569/597 call spread costs about $13.35, or nearly 48% of the difference between the strikes. The maximum reward of $14.65 is only 10% higher than the cost of buying the spread. The peak profit ratio here is merely 1.1:1. Thus, the payoff for a 5% decline over approximately one month is more attractive than a 5% increase. While it is true that the market rises more often than it falls over any 30 days, this fact offers little consolation when the difference in risk-reward is so significant. Another way to observe the asymmetry is to consider an ""in-the-money"" call spread with no extrinsic premium. This refers to a call spread where the in-the-money call has the same extrinsic value as the out-of-the-money call. Using May 30th options, an example would be the 500/590 call spread. Both options have between $6 and $7 of ""extrinsic"" value. This trade involves over $68 of downside risk and only $21.40 in potential upside. Even though the market tends to rise more often than it falls, and a 12% decline in just over a month is unusual, most investors would not find such terms attractive. Sometimes, however, this can work in an investor's favor. Take Bitcoin or its ETF proxy, IBIT , for instance. Bitcoin has fallen over 11% year-to-date, but options might provide a way to make a bullish bet with favorable risk and reward. IBIT YTD mountain iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF For example, a trader could buy a June 42/60 call spread for $7.57. That spread is $7.18 ""in the money"" (the current price of $49.18 minus the $42 strike). Therefore, there is very little decay. The maximum possible loss is $7.57, while the maximum potential gain is $10.82. Incidentally, I chose the $60 strike first because that is close to the all-time high. Like many securities, I imagine it may encounter some resistance at a prior high even if it does eventually break through it. The moral of the story is this: If options exhibit a lot of ""put skew"" (negative skewness), put spreads may offer better risk/reward. If ""call skew"" (positive skewness) is elevated, call spreads may be the way to go. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

"Wall Street analysts say Elon Musk is the clear auto tariff winner: 'Tesla wins, Detroit bleeds'","Several analysts on Wall Street see a clear winner emerging from President Donald Trump 's new auto tariff policy: Tesla . Trump announced on Wednesday that all cars not made in the U.S. would be slapped with a 25% tariff beginning next week. The news sent shares of major American car producers in diverging directions in Thursday's trading as Wall Street analyzed who would be most and least hurt by the policy change. So far, multiple analysts see Elon Musk 's electric vehicle giant as a relative beneficiary given its domestic production. The stock rose modestly after rallying during the session. Put simply: ""Tesla wins, Detroit bleeds,"" wrote Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska in a Thursday note to clients. Tesla: 'Clear structural winner' Roeska called Tesla the ""clear structural winner"" of the policy, adding that it has a localized market share and is ""better insulated"" from trade risk. On the other hand, he said Ford and General Motors could see declines of up to 30% in earnings before interest and taxes this year. ""For everyone else, this is a margin reset and real drag on near-term earnings power,"" he said of companies besides Tesla. UBS analyst Joseph Spak noted both Tesla and competitor Rivian could ""fare better"" with 100% of production in the U.S. Rivian shares popped more than 7% on Thursday. TSLA 1D mountain Tesla, 1-day But for others in the industry, Spak said there will ""clearly be some pain"" as tariffs take effect. TD Cowen analyst Itay Michaeli said Tesla's substantial domestic sourcing helps make the company a ""relative winner."" This is especially true for Tesla's Model Y, which competes in the midsize crossover segment, a category that will now see close to half of all vehicles hit with levies. Presumably, a portion of the tariffs is likely to be passed on to consumers, making these vehicles more pricey. Despite Thursday's gains, Tesla shares have tumbled around 30% this year. Some of the declines have been attributed to political backlash against Musk, who is a key aid to Trump and acts as the face of the president's government efficiency initiative. As Tesla shares declined, Trump said earlier this month that he would purchase a Tesla in a show of support for Musk. But Trump said the billionaire entrepreneur did not advise on auto tariffs because of a potential conflict of interest. Musk posted on his social media platform X that his company was not immune to effects from the policy. ""Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here,"" Musk wrote. ""The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant."" Still, Wall Street expects Tesla stock to rebound ahead, with most analysts polled by LSEG having a buy rating and an average price target suggesting about 18% in upside. A 'worst case' scenario? TD Cowen's Michaeli called Trump's announcement ""close to the worst case outcome"" compared with recent expectations for the policy. He expects a ""significant"" initial impact to the Detroit Big Three. Based on policy as it is currently understood, he said Ford should be the least exposed in the group, while Stellantis may be the most exposed. UBS' Spak said to expect automakers to raise prices as a result. For Ford and General Motors, he estimated the average price tag could rise between $4,000 and $5,000 if 100% of the cost increase is mitigated. Analysts pointed out that not every legacy automaker would be hit equally. Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu, for instance, listed Ford alongside Tesla in the ""most shielded"" bucket. There are also some points of disagreement on which firms would feel the most pressure. Despite Michaeli saying Stellantis would be most exposed, Bernstein's Roeska said the company should show ""relative resilience"" compared with other Detroit Big Three carmakers. Ford's stock declined more than 3%, while GM shares plunged more than 7%. Stellantis stock fell more than 1%. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Watch these stocks that have gone from worst performers to top winners in market roller coaster,"The stocks that have led the market rally to record highs are still where investors should be, according to Piper Sandler. Heightened uncertainty from President Donald Trump 's new tariff policies , along with recent data points indicating a potentially softening economy, have riled markets in recent weeks. The S & P 500 , Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all lower for the year. But going forward, Piper Sandler is optimistic that the bull market run will continue. In a Thursday note, Craig Johnson, the firm's chief market technician, voiced his belief that the market hit an ""intermediate-term bottom"" on March 13. ""Following a four-week losing streak that left U.S. equities in correction territory, we believe the weight of technical evidence now suggests an intermediate-term low may be in place, and stocks have room to run, resulting in a 14.25% upside to our 2025 SPX year-end price objective of 6,600,"" he wrote. In the same note, Piper Sandler suggested investors may want to stick to the stocks that underperformed during the correction from February to March, but then became the best-performing stocks from March 13 to March 24. ""We believe now is a prime opportunity for investors to capitalize on beaten-down stocks that have confirmed longer-term support,"" Johnson wrote. ""Investors may want to take a closer look at these stocks, as they represent companies that investors have quickly returned to following the correction. This suggests that prior leadership, before the correction, has not changed."" Below are some of the stocks that pivoted from market laggards to leaders following the correction: One name on the list was cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike , which lost 26% between Feb. 19 and March 13. But it rallied 12% from March 13 to March 24. On Tuesday, BTIG analyst Gray Powell upgraded CrowdStrike to a buy rating from neutral. Powell also initiated a price target of $431, representing approximately 16% upside from the stock's value on Wednesday. ""First, with the 7/19/2024 IT outage now eight months in the rearview mirror, we think CRWD has much better visibility on forecasts,"" the analyst wrote. ""More importantly, we see CRWD emerging as the cleanest platform play across the security software space."" Powell added that when it comes to CrowdStrike, a ""premium valuation is warranted"" due to the stock's potential total revenue growth. Cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line tumbled 31% from February to March, but gained 12% in the 11 days after. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley upgraded shares to equal weight from underweight. ""We await greater signs of stabilization before being more constructive outright,"" wrote analyst Stephen Grambling. His $22 price target is nearly 9% above where shares of Norwegian Cruise closed on Wednesday afternoon.

GameStop shares drop 22% after the retailer issues debt to buy bitcoin,"Traders work at the post where GameStop is traded on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on June 12, 2024.

The meme stock plunged 22.1%, following an almost 12% rally the previous session. The reversal came after the video game chain announced plans to raise $1.3 billion through the sale of convertible senior notes due in 2030 to buy bitcoin.

On Tuesday, the GameStop board unanimously approved a plan to buy cryptocurrencies using corporate cash or future debt and equity proceeds, echoing a move made famous by MicroStrategy .

Under the latest sale, a round of convertible debt will require issuing 46 million additional shares of GameStop, bringing the company's cash to $6.1 billion, up from about $4.8 billion, according to Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.

""We suspect that GameStop's share price will drift lower prior to the issuance of the convert, particularly given that a convert investor will receive a zero coupon and will be required to have faith that the GameStop meme phenomenon will persist for another five years,"" Pachter, who has an underperform rating on GameStop, said in a note to clients.

The analyst is doubtful that GameStop's foray into bitcoin following MicroStrategy's playbook will be as successful because of the stock's already-high valuation.

GameStop is currently valued at $12.7 billion, more than twice the cash balance after the convertible is issued. By contrast, MicroStrategy trades at less than two times the value of its bitcoin holdings.

""With GameStop already trading at more than 2x its cash holdings it is unlikely that its conversion of cash into Bitcoin will drive an even greater premium,"" Pachter said.

"HSBC slashes its Tesla price target, sees shares falling more than 50%","There are ""no quick fixes"" to Tesla's problems, according to HSBC.

Its new price target of $120, down from $135, implies shares adding just 8.9% from Wednesday's close. Analyst Blayne Curtis cited intensifying competition from Intel and results from a Jefferies benchmarking study that indicate AMD's graphics processing units significantly underperformed Nvidia's throughout various open-source models. Intel's incoming CEO will likely make the company more flexible on strategy that will result in the company producing ""fairly competitive chips"" starting next year, according to Curtis, making the company more competitive versus AMD. AMD YTD mountain AMD in 2025 ""When we assumed coverage of AMD back in May 2024, we saw continued share gains in PC/Server but had some concerns on the AI ramp and wanted to see more progress to justify a continued positive stance. Fast forward to today, we are still not seeing much traction in AI to support the $10-15B of AI revenue the street is baking in for 2026/2027 and see Intel's new management as a catalyst for them to become more competitive, particularly in Client PC,"" Curtis wrote. Shares declined more than 2% in the premarket following the downgrade. AMD has fallen around 8.8% in 2025, putting it down 38.6% over the past 12 months. ""The stock has already pulled back significantly, but Street estimates still seem too high, and we see more downside risk than upside potential near-term,"" Curtis said.

Ramp up portfolio income – and save on taxes – with these assets,"With Tax Day approaching and investment returns harder to come by of late, how much you save on taxes can boost your portfolio's performance and income. A strategic approach toward managing a portfolio's taxes – namely tax-loss harvesting and tax deferral – can help lift after-tax returns by about 2% per year, according to Neuberger Berman . The boost is known as tax alpha. Tax-loss harvesting refers to strategically pruning losing positions to realize losses and offset capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio. You don't have to be a million-dollar investor to realize the benefits of these strategies – or to make missteps that could cost you money at tax time. ""This is a broad generalization, but most people have no idea how their portfolio impacts their taxes,"" said Catherine Valega, certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Green Bee Advisory in Burlington, Mass. ""Most people have no idea how their assets work and combine to relate into what their tax bill will be."" Using income now or later The tools you need to manage the taxes paid now and in the future include taxable brokerage accounts, tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) plan or individual retirement account) and tax-free accounts (including your Roth IRA). Which of these accounts you choose for your income-generating holdings will depend on your priorities, according to Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar. ""To the extent you prioritize income producers, you'll want to focus your attention on your tax-sheltered vehicles in an effort to avoid having to pay taxes on those distributions,"" she said. Tax-deferred accounts, for instance, might be a great place to keep high-yield and corporate bonds and the funds holding them. That's because the interest income they produce is subject to ordinary income tax rates, which can be as high as 37%. Real estate investment trusts are generally another contender for tax-deferred accounts, due to the sizable dividend yields they offer. By holding them in an IRA, investors defer taxes on the dividends they receive until they begin withdrawing income. Dividend-paying stocks and funds may be contenders for taxable brokerage accounts, particularly if the dividends are taxed at the same rate as capital gains (0%, 15% or 20%) and the investor is planning on spending the money. ""You still get distributions year in and year out, so unless you're looking for spending money, even dividend-paying stocks may be better in a tax-sheltered account, where you aren't paying taxes year to year even at a lower rate,"" said Benz. Municipal bonds , which offer tax-free income at the federal level – and at the state level if the investor is a resident of the issuing state – could best belong in a brokerage account. However, Treasury bills could go in either taxable or tax-deferred accounts, depending on the time horizon and how the interest income is being used, Benz said. The tax-season sweetener for Treasury interest income is that it's subject to federal levies but exempt from state and local taxes. US1Y 1Y mountain U.S. 1-year Treasury bill yield over the past year. ""We went through periods where yields were so low for so long that nobody thought about the income they might've received, but if you're not using cash for living expenses, it may make sense to keep them in a tax-sheltered account,"" she said of T-bills. Consider that while the yield on the 1-year T-bill is well off the highs it hit last year when it surpassed 5%, it's still yielding roughly 4.1%. Managing taxes on portfolio income In addition to being mindful of asset location, Valega uses a strategy with her clients that's known as direct indexing . This entails buying the individual stocks of an index and then managing the portfolio to benefit from tax-loss harvesting by trimming losing positions and offsetting realized gains. For high-net-worth clients, she's been using portfolios of individual muni bond issues on the fixed income side. She prefers this over buying muni bond mutual funds or exchange traded funds, as her clients intend to hold onto their issues until maturity and would rather not be subject to the price swings seen in bond funds. She encourages investors to stash 12 months to 18 months of expenses in an emergency fund, and while this comes with a tax bill – interest from certificates of deposit and most money market funds is taxed at the same rate as ordinary income – it's not as much of a surprise as it might've been a year or two ago. ""Why are your taxes higher? Because you earned some nice income,"" said Valega. ""We are a year or two down that cycle, and people are starting to be aware that it's an issue, but it's a nice problem to have.""",2025-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/ramp-up-portfolio-income-and-save-on-taxes-with-these-assets.html,cnbc
CoreWeave CEO says debt is 'the fuel for this company',"CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator unpacked the cloud computing company's first day on the market in a Friday interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer, defending its decision to raise a hefty debt load.

""The debt is the engine, it's the fuel for this company,"" Intrator said. ""We go out, we find great contracts with great counterparties that need massive scale computing to drive their business, and then we go ahead and we go back to our syndicate of lenders, and they give us the debt to stand up the clusters that will deliver revenue to the company.""

The IPO debuted on a tough day for the indexes, especially for tech stocks, whose losses helped the Nasdaq Composite plunge 2.7%. CoreWeave, which sells artificial intelligence technology in the cloud, opened at $39 and closed flat at $40, raising $1.5 billion in its share sale. It's the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021, even as the company set its share price at $40, lower than the previously expected range of $47 to $55. Intrator told CNBC the lower pricing was ""where the buying interest was"" and claimed there are ""a lot of headwinds in the macro.""

CoreWeave has raised almost $13 billion in debt, CNBC reported, much of which is for GPUs in the company's leased data centers in the U.S. and abroad. Intrator told Cramer that debt on the balance sheet is offset by a larger revenue contract.

Ahead of its market debut, the AI outfit bought 250,000 of Nvidia 's graphics chips. Many of them are from the Hopper generation, models that were scarce and in demand over the past few years. There are concerns that these products will lose relevancy in the quickly-advancing world of AI – and Nvidia has already started shipping out the model's successor, Blackwell.

Intrator refuted those concerns and highlighted the company's recent deal with OpenAI for just under $12 billion, which he said was executed for five years with two one-year extensions. Deals like this, he said, indicate that companies believe the infrastructure will have value far into the future.

""Those same buyers will come back, they will buy new infrastructure that is the most cutting edge for their next models,"" he said. ""And then they'll take this, this earlier infrastructure and use it for other use cases in their company that requires really large bulk compute.""",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/coreweave-ceo-says-debt-is-the-fuel-for-this-company.html,cnbc
KB Home unveils its first 'fire-resilient' community in Southern California,"Just months after raging wildfires destroyed thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area, California-based KB Home is unveiling what it calls its first ""wildfire-resilient"" community.

The development, in Escondido, just outside San Diego, will have 64 single-family homes when completed that all meet the wildfire resilience standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), a nonprofit, scientific research and communications organization supported by property insurers. These standards are designed to protect the homes against the three major sources of ignition during a wildfire: Flying embers, flames and radiant heat.

A handful of homes in the development are now complete, with roughly 20 homes already sold. Three homeowners have moved in, according to KB Home.

The homes are built with covered gutters, enclosed eaves, noncombustible siding — like stucco and fiber cement — tempered-glass windows, and non-combustible patios, doors and roofing. They have six-inch vertical clearance using the concrete foundation, stucco and stone. They also incorporate defensible space with low-combustible vegetation at least 5 feet from the homes. Metal fencing is used throughout the neighborhood.

Steve Ruffner, regional general manager of KB Home's coastal division, said he and his colleagues saw a fire-resistant home demonstration by IBHS at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference last summer and were impressed by the opportunity this type of community presented. Since KB Home had already broken ground on the development, they had to change gears quickly to incorporate the fire-resilient components.

""We had to change the architecture on the fly to a more stucco-oriented architecture with fire-resistant shutters, or fire-free shutters and doors and tempered windows. We were able to do that really quickly with the city, because they wanted to work with us. They really understood that this was important for their city,"" Ruffner said.

He called it more of a research and development project to see what the costs might be and how to work with trade partners to lower that cost, although he wouldn't say how much those costs increased.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/kb-home-fire-resilient-community-california.html,cnbc
Mining giant Fortescue says Big Oil is getting it wrong on renewables: 'Your customers want green energy',"Australian mining tycoon Andrew Forrest, founder and executive chairman of Fortescue, says Big Oil is getting it wrong on renewables — at a time when European energy majors are doubling down on fossil fuels to boost near-term shareholder returns.

Britain's BP and Norway's Equinor have both recently outlined plans to slash renewable spending in favor of oil and gas. London-listed Shell, meanwhile, has also scaled back green investment plans.

U.S. oil majors such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron , which have outperformed their European rivals in recent years, have typically advocated for transition options such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, rather than for renewable technologies like wind and solar.

""I've always found that the customer is always right, which is why we're going renewable and moving away from oil and gas because our customers are saying, 'we want energy but not at any cost, and if you can give us green energy at the same price as dirty [energy] then we are going to buy green every day.' That's my job, and that's Fortescue's job,"" Forrest told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""You've got data centers popping up all over Europe and they want green energy if they can get it. They'll take dirty [energy] if they can't, sure. That's Exxon Mobil's and Total 's argument, 'well, we're just doing what the customers want.' Actually, you're not. Your customers want green energy,"" Forrest said.

""Well, if [the] oil and gas [industry] doesn't want to supply green energy, guess what, Fortescue will,"" he added.

Op Ed: India needs to urgently decarbonize its power sector. Here's how it can succeed,"India has always been a country of dichotomies. It is the world's most populous nation, fifth biggest economy and home to the highest number of billionaires after China and the U.S. It is a world leader in digital finance, thanks to the creation of digital public infrastructure, and is the world's third-largest start-up hub. Yet it remains a lower-middle-income economy, with a large share of the population classified as low-income or poor, and is a highly unequal society. India's climate narrative is, similarly, marked by contradictions. While its contribution to world cumulative emissions is negligible — India accounts for approximately 4% of the global stock of emissions in the atmosphere — and it is one of the lowest emitters on a per-capita basis, India is already the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses on an annual basis, and is, worryingly, home to 12 of the world's 15 most polluted cities.

With India forecast to be the world's fastest-growing large economy and biggest oil consumer over the coming years, if it does not take action fast, emissions will only continue to rise.

'Greening' of the power sector

India needs to act not only for the world to achieve the Paris Agreement ambitions, but also for its own survival. More than 75% of Indian districts are at risk of extreme weather and it is already seeing fiercer cyclones, greater incidences of drought and flooding and more heatwaves. While these climatic changes will impact worker productivity and economic output in aggregate, they will disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and farmers — 60% of which are monsoon-dependent. While India needs to decarbonize its entire economy, achieving its target of net-zero emissions by 2070 arguably hinges on the ""greening"" of its power sector. With a 34% share, India's power industry constitutes the single biggest source of emissions in India, and its grid ranks as the fourth most carbon-intensive in the world. Coal still accounts for almost 50% of installed power capacity, and more than 70% of power generation. With greater power demand expected from consumers, as well as existing and emerging areas of industry, in the near future, and the ongoing electrification of the economy also putting greater pressure on the grid, emissions from power will continue to rise if left unabated.

In recognition of the imperative to decarbonize power as a means to drive the whole-economy emissions transition, the government has outlined impressive clean energy targets: achieving a 50% share of renewables in power capacity by 2030 and energy independence by 2047. India has made impressive strides toward these goals. As a result of significant private sector investment, India now ranks fourth of all countries globally on installed solar and wind power capacity and its addition of renewable power capacity has been particularly strong in recent years. Unfortunately, this simply isn't enough. To truly decarbonize its energy sector, India needs to act on three fronts.

1. Integrating renewable energy into the grid

Apart from greater renewable capacity installation — for context, India's additions in 2024 represented only 8% of China's — India needs to find ways to integrate greater amounts of renewable energy into its grid, a challenge that countries globally are grappling with, while continuing to invest in baseload (or round-the-clock readily available) power. To do this, India needs to invest more in battery storage infrastructure — including via pumped hydro storage, new and innovative battery energy storage systems, and also green hydrogen.

Indeed, the inability to transmit renewable energy into the grid when it is generated in surplus (for example, solar during summer months in south-western states) often leads to curtailment, or the intentional offloading of power production, as the lack of storage capacity prevents its use in power-scarce states. Digitalization of the grid will also be key to integrating renewables. Emerging digital technologies can enable power operators to access information from renewable energy assets and consumers in real time, allowing them to operate intelligent load-dispatching systems based on current supply and demand. In order to have a tangible impact on renewable power integration, grid digitalization will need to take place concurrently with electricity market reform. Currently, India's state electricity distribution companies, or DISCOMs, have limited flexibility in incorporating renewables as per availability and demand as they are locked into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Plans for what's known as a Market-Based Economic Dispatch System, which would centralize power purchase and dispatch across the country on a real-time basis, will enable India to transition from relatively inflexible locked-in power agreements with thermal power producers to lowest-cost (including renewable) generation.

A digital energy grid overlaid with centralized power purchase and dispatch will improve efficiency in power trading, and also likely lead to lower power prices. While this transition takes place, greater flexibility is needed at India's coal power plants to ensure a steady baseload supply of power, while more investment in nuclear is needed to guarantee future energy security. Reassuringly, India has already outlined plans for both.

2. Improving energy efficiency

The second front constitutes a greater focus on enhancing energy efficiency, both on the demand and supply side. On the demand side, smart appliances, buildings, and meters, coupled with time-of-day tariffs, can enable better demand optimization. On the supply side, meanwhile, the professionalization of state distribution companies via arrangements with private operators can be instrumental in reducing transmission losses. India sees heavy losses in power transmission across most states as infrastructure remains outdated, while leakages and theft are rampant. Indian residential and agricultural consumers have long thought of electricity as a free public good, and for good reason. India's DISCOMs heavily subsidize power to these two segments. Professionalization of power distribution can help lower these subsidies and reduce wastage. States that have professionalized distribution have indeed shown a significant reduction in transmission and distribution losses. In a power-hungry — power demand is expected to quadruple by 2050 — and historically power-scarce country, there is no room for waste.

3. Decentralized energy solutions

The third front constitutes the greater installation and use of decentralized renewable energy (DRE) solutions, including rooftop solar and microgrids. This will enable India to meet the dual goals of both improving power access for India's remote and marginalized communities, as well as greening its power supply. Progress on the installation of rooftop solar has been slow so far, impeded by a lack of affordability, consumer awareness and trained personnel, with only around 16 gigawatts installed versus a target of 40 gigawatts. Microgrids, meanwhile, remain commercially unviable, and more impact — non-commercially minded — capital will be required to get such initiatives off the ground. Hearteningly, recent government initiatives signal progress on decentralized renewable energy, and this installation will be important in lowering grid load and emissions.

Where the funding could come from

All three prongs of India's energy sector transition will require funding. According to expert estimates, India needs to spend around $100 billion per year, or 2.8% of current nominal GDP, to achieve net-zero power sector emissions by 2070. With various imminent and urgent competing demands on the country's budget, public finance will simply not be enough. India will need to attract greater amounts of philanthropic, foreign, and private capital, as well as develop creative financing structures, to meet its net-zero target. Each of these capital sources has a specific role to play.

Greenpeace ordered to pay more than $660 million over Dakota Access Pipeline protests,"The Greenpeace logo on the green ecological awareness stand of the association in Lyon, France, on Oct. 23, 2024.

A jury on Wednesday ordered environmental campaign group Greenpeace to pay more than $660 million in damages to Texas-based oil company Energy Transfer, the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

A nine-person jury in Mandan, North Dakota, reached a verdict after roughly two days of deliberations. The outcome found Greenpeace liable for hundreds of millions of dollars over actions taken to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline nearly a decade ago.

It marks an extraordinary legal blow for Greenpeace, which had previously warned that it could be forced into bankruptcy because of the case. The environmental advocacy group said it intends to appeal the verdict.

""This case should alarm everyone, no matter their political inclinations,"" Greenpeace U.S. interim executive director Sushma Raman said in a statement published Wednesday.

""It's part of a renewed push by corporations to weaponise our courts to silence dissent. We should all be concerned about the future of the First Amendment, and lawsuits like this aimed at destroying our rights to peaceful protest and free speech,"" Raman said.

Greenpeace has described Energy Transfer's case as a clear-cut example of SLAPPs, referring to a lawsuit designed to bury activist groups in legal fees and ultimately silence dissent.

How 3D-printing 'microfactories' can transform plastic waste into brand new products,"A new era of 3D printing ""microfactories"" is helping to turn waste plastics into ""highly competitive"" products fit for use in the construction industry, according to Veena Sahajwalla, professor and founding director of UNSW Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) Centre.

Speaking to CNBC's Mandy Drury at Schneider Electric's Sydney Innovation Summit on Monday in Australia, Sahajwalla said manufacturers had to direct their thinking around sustainability toward profitability.

""It's not about saying, well I'm making it because its green. Actually, that should be the last thing. The first thing has to be profitability, does it work? Is it showing the right performance?"" she said.

That thinking has pushed SMaRT to build plastic filaments made from 100% waste plastics, sourced from ""all kinds of old printers.""

They are built in hyper-localized, heavily automated ""microfactories"" to produce personalized products.

""If this [waste-made plastic] can now be fed into a 3D printer, can you actually print a whole range of products?"" she said.

Cambium is a startup aiming to disrupt the wood recycling space. Its Baltimore-based researchers are working on new ways to track, treat and transfer old wood into the supply chain. It bills itself as the platform ""where timber meets tech.""

""We make it really easy to source wood that would have otherwise been wasted and we build technology for the wood industry so that we can save material, create new local jobs and address climate change at scale,"" said CEO Ben Christensen.

Every piece of Cambium's ""carbon smart"" wood has a barcode. Scan it, and Cambium's app will identify what the species is, when it was milled and what its grade is.

Cambium's technology helps find, recycle and then deliver the wood across the United States and to parts of Canada. The company works with local tree care services, trucking companies and saw mills as well as companies like Amazon , CBRE , Gensler and Room and Board.

""We help truckers coordinate loads so they can actually move this material, and then we help sawmills source that material, track that material when they're actually using it within their sawmill and then ultimately sell that material as well,"" Christensen said.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/this-startup-is-creating-a-global-tech-platform-for-recycled-wood.html,cnbc

A dynamic storm that prompted foreboding predictions of dangerous weekend weather spawned tornadoes, dust storms and wildfires that killed at least 39 people and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses.

The weakening but still volatile weather system was moving Monday into the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, bringing thunderstorms, hail, damaging winds and the potential for more tornadoes.

Here's what to know about the unusually erratic and damaging weather.

Forecasters warned of dangerous winds from Florida all the way north to New Jersey, while heavy rain was likely across New York and New England.

A tornado watch was in effect until early Monday for a large swath of North Carolina and Virginia, with gusts potentially reaching 70 mph and possible hail the size of ping pong balls, according to the National Weather Service office in Blacksburg, Virginia.

"Communication is now even more important to getting renewable projects off the ground, experts say","(From left) CNBC's Steve Sedgwick moderates an IoT panel with Cenk Alper, CEO of Sabanci Holding, Christina Shim, chief sustainability officer of IBM, and Mitesh Patel, interim CEO and COO of SunCable International, at CONVERGE LIVE on March 13, 2025.

Renewable energy companies can shorten the long approval process needed for their projects by communicating better with stakeholders, according to experts.

Christina Shim, IBM's chief sustainability officer, said sponsors need to focus on the business value — in addition to the environmental benefits — when discussing their projects.

""That being said ... there are some triggering words now, depending on where you sit around the world, and I think the more that you can quantify business value for what you're doing and tie it to, again, the business operations and business decision making, it's only going to be more and more important,"" Shim said Thursday.

""As long as the outcomes are the same, you just need to make sure that you're communicating in an appropriate way with the right stakeholders.""

She compared it to how one might talk to a CFO, versus an investor, versus someone in procurement. ""You kind of have to talk about things a little bit differently.""

Mitesh Patel, interim CEO and COO at SunCable International, agrees that adjusting communication for the right audience is crucial.

""For politicians, the voters are their constituency, not your project or not your company. You have to help them translate what benefits your project will bring to the constituents,"" said Patel, whose company is developing a project to deliver solar energy from Australia to Singapore via undersea cables.

The project, called Australia-Asia PowerLink, is valued around $24 billion and expected to supply Singapore with 1.75 gigawatts of electricity — or around 15% of its electricity needs, according to the company.

The comments by Shim and Patel, who were speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on a panel in Singapore, come as renewable energy projects often take many years to get off the ground.

A report from the Global Infrastructure hub, which is part of the World Bank's Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, noted the complex nature of preparation needed before an infrastructure project gets underway. It put the average project preparation time at 6 years but said it can take up to 14 years if the project is not planned properly.",2025-03-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/better-communications-key-to-getting-renewable-projects-off-the-ground.html,cnbc

How Elon Musk's Trump support could hurt — or help — Tesla,"Elon Musk has become, in some people's words, President Donald Trump's 'first buddy.' But the Trump administration's moves to strip away a lot of EV-friendly policies have led some Tesla investors, analysts, and EV researchers to insist this will all be disastrous for the company, the largest U.S. EV maker by far.

More bullish analysts say otherwise: That Musk's White House presence could be a boon for Tesla, whose future lies in autonomous driving and robotics.

""The story for Tesla going forward is autonomous and robotics, and we've never viewed Tesla as an automobile company,"" said Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives.

Having Trump in office, ""massively changes the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles,"" he added.

""I think that you actually have a federal roadmap that will be created, which speaks to our view that the bet for the ages was Musk's bet on Trump,"" he said.

More bearish analysts and investors aren't so sure.

Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber is one of them. Gerber told CNBC his firm holds about 280,000 shares of Tesla, which is just over half of what he had at the stock's highest point.

""I don't see where Tesla goes from here, because the fact is autonomy doesn't work — still doesn't work,"" Gerber said. ""I literally take my Cybertruck. I can't drive five minutes without having to disengage. And then the Waymos are just like driving around me like crazy. And I'm like, we're just not there. And I don't think the hardware is going to get us there and people aren't buying the vehicles.""

People aren't buying the vehicles, in Gerber's opinion, because of Musk's Trump support and his activity in the White House.

""Elon is probably the most hated person in the world,"" he said. ""Most people around the world, you know, hate Elon. And the way they're taking it out is on Tesla. And it's a really unfortunate thing.""",2025-03-11 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/how-elon-musks-trump-support-could-hurt-or-help-tesla.html,cnbc
From crop rotation to 'mob-grazed' livestock: Inside the sustainable farm beloved by King Charles III,"King Charles III (then Prince Charles) visits Honeydale Farm in the Cotswolds region of England on June 22, 2021. The King is known to be a supporter of sustainable agriculture.

When King Charles III visited Honeydale Farm in England's Cotswolds region, one of his first remarks was: ""Monoculture. That's our problem.""

That's the recollection of the farm's owner Ian Wilkinson, as he walked down its drive with the then Prince Charles almost four years ago.

""And I nodded, and thought: 'well, absolutely,'"" Wilkinson told CNBC via video call.

Monoculture refers to the common practice of growing a single crop on a piece of land, sometimes year after year. Crops are grown in this way for efficiency, but critics say doing so depletes soil nutrients and increases the risk of disease.

The king — a longtime supporter of organic farming — visited Honeydale to learn about its focus on growing a wide variety of plants, a technique that aims to regenerate the soil.

Wilkinson studied agriculture in the 1970s when monoculture was encouraged after a post-World War II drive for the U.K. to import less food and become more self-sufficient.

""We were trained to produce more food and do it cheaply — and we didn't have much regard for the environment, for nature,"" Wilkinson said. Farmers relied on fertilizers made from petrochemicals, he added, and today, only around 3% of agricultural land in the U.K. is farmed organically, according to the most recent government statistics.

A long career at the Cotswold Seed Company, which supplies farms with seeds for wildflowers, grasses and root crops, meant Wilkinson heard from a lot of farmers, some of whom emphasized the need for self-sufficiency and for a diverse range of crops.",2025-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/03/the-sustainable-farm-beloved-by-king-charles-farmed-in-the-cotswolds.html,cnbc
Trump plan to freeze funding stymies Biden-era energy rebates for consumers,"Westend61 | Westend61 | Getty Images

Some states have stopped disbursing funds to consumers via Biden-era rebate programs tied to home energy efficiency, due to a Trump administration freeze on federal funding enacted in January. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, had earmarked $8.8 billion of federal funds for consumers through two home energy rebate programs, to be administered by states, territories and the District of Columbia. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and Rhode Island — which are in various phases of rollout — have paused or delayed their fledgling programs, citing Trump administration policy.

The White House on Jan. 27 put a freeze on the disbursement of federal funds that conflict with President Trump's agenda — including initiatives related to green energy and climate change — as a reason for halting the disbursement of rebate funds to consumers. That fate of that freeze is still up in the air. A federal judge issued an order Tuesday that continued to block the policy, for example. However, it appears agencies had been withholding funding in some cases in defiance of earlier court rulings, according to ProPublica reporting. In any event, the freeze — or the threat of it — appears to be impacting state rebate programs. ""Coloradans who would receive the Home Energy Rebate savings are still locked out by the Trump administration in the dead of winter,"" Ari Rosenblum, a spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, said in an e-mailed statement. The U.S. Department of Energy and the White House didn't return a request for comment from CNBC on the funding freeze.

In some states, rebates are 'currently unavailable'

watch now

The Georgia Environmental Finance Authority launched a pilot program for the rebates in fall 2024. That program is ongoing, a spokesperson confirmed Monday. However, the timeline for a full program launch initially planned for 2025 ""is delayed until we receive more information from the U.S. Department of Energy,"" the Georgia spokesperson explained in an e-mail. However, not all states have pressed the pause button: It appears Maine is still moving forward, for example. ""The program remains open to those who are eligible,"" Afton Vigue, a spokesperson for the Maine Governor's Energy Office, said in an e-mail. The status of rebates in the eight other states and districts to have launched their programs is unclear. Their respective energy departments or governor's offices didn't return requests for comment.

Oil major BP to slash renewable spending and double down on fossil fuels in strategy reset,"The BP logo is displayed outside a petrol station on January 30, 2025 in Warrington, United Kingdom.

British oil major BP on Wednesday announced plans to increase annual oil and gas investment to $10 billion through 2027 as part of a fundamental strategic reset.

The beleaguered energy giant also said it planned to lower its annual capital expenditure to sit within a range of $13 and $15 billion over the same time horizon, while targeting $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027.

The oil major said investment in transition businesses would be ""significantly lower"" over the coming years. The firm said spending is now likely to come in at $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year — more than $5 billion per year below the previous guidance.

""Today we have fundamentally reset bp's strategy,"" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.

""We are reducing and reallocating capital expenditure to our highest-returning businesses to drive growth, and relentlessly pursuing performance improvements and cost efficiency. This is all in service of sustainably growing cash flow and returns,"" he added.

How AI is speeding the mining of valuable metals needed to power the clean economy,"As the clean energy economy expands, finding the minerals and metals that power it becomes increasingly critical. The answer might lie with artificial intelligence.

Electric cars, solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells all have one thing in common: the need for precious metals.

Historically, that's required going through the arduous process of finding the metals and then getting them out of the ground. But new technologies from a slew of companies might be changing the game.

Kobold Metals, VerAI and a startup called Earth AI are in a race to get the metals to market as soon as possible. Earth AI combines AI-powered mineral discovery software with proprietary drilling technology. Its data goes back 50 years.

""We train our AI to learn from failures and successes of decades of hundreds of geologists that explored in the past to make much better predictions for where to look for metals in the future,"" said Roman Teslyuk, CEO of Earth AI.

When the system finds what it thinks are metal deposits, Earth AI can drill down to verify it in just a tennis ball-sized hole. Teslyuk said that using this mining process takes half the cost and a fraction of the amount of time that was previously required. Individual annual mine revenues can range from $50 million to $3 billion, according to Mining Data Online.

""We drill down to 2,000 feet and grab a sample of rock that has never seen light, and the metals in that rock, they can build hundreds of millions of electric cars,"" Teslyuk said. ""They can turn our grid renewable. This rock can get us off hydrocarbons.""

Earth AI doesn't explore around existing mines, but finds new areas and then sells that information to mining companies.

""The market for these minerals is massive,"" said Jamie Lee, managing partner at Tamarack Global, an investor in Earth AI. ""The way that they have approached this really caught our attention because there's a there is a significant moat in their business model and the way that they've trained their large language model.""

Other investors include Y Combinator, Cantos Ventures, Scrum Ventures, Alpaca, Sparkwave Capital and Overmatch. The company has raised a total of $38 million.

Earth AI explores on its own, as well as with partners to find deposits faster. The company recently discovered one of the largest verified deposits of palladium in Australia using AI as part of a joint venture with Legacy Minerals.

Friedrich Merz, migration hard-liner and longtime rival of Angela Merkel, is expected to become Germany's next chancellor. His party the Christian Democratic Union is leading polls alongside its affiliate the Christian Social Union just days before the election. Back in September, Merz was elected as the CDU party's designated candidate for chancellor in this year's federal elections, after leading the organization and heading the opposition CDU-CSU parliamentary group since 2022. The CSU is a regional party which has dominated Bavarian politics for decades and forms a union with the CDU at a federal level.

Between politics and business

Before entering politics, Merz, 69, studied law and first worked as a judge, then as a lawyer at Mayer Brown LLP. He has also held senior positions at various major corporations, including BlackRock Germany and HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt, as well as serving on the boards of EY Germany, Borussia Dortmund and the Deutsche Börse. Merz is married with three children. He reportedly owns two airplanes, which he pilots in his spare time.

Merz says that he joined the CDU when he was still in school, eventually leading the local branch of the party's youth organization. In 1989 he took on the role of member of the European Parliament for a five-year tenure before joining Germany's Bundestag for 15 years. Much of Merz's political career in the early 2000s was marked by a rivalry with Merkel, with the two vying for leadership positions in the CDU as well as of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. Merz first became chair and then deputy head of the latter group after 2000. He resigned from this position in 2004, with observers at the time suggesting this was due to Merkel's rise through the ranks.

Results were sharply down year over year, but ""exceeded the Street's very low expectations as well as our numbers,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Joseph Osha told clients in a Wednesday note.

""The company also managed to generate positive free cash flow as SEDG continued to draw down inventory and trade receivables,"" Osha wrote.

However, revenue of $196.2 million beat expectations of $189.1 million, even though it was down 17% from the year-ago quarter.

SolarEdge and stocks exposed to the residential solar sector have struggled in the face of high interest rates and a glut of product they have had trouble offloading.

Wind energy just had a record year in Germany — but the federal election could shake things up,"2024 was a strong year for aeolian energy in Germany, with permit awards for onshore wind turbines accelerating, according to industry data — but the upcoming Feb. 23 election means the sector now faces uncertainty, amid vocal skepticism from the two parties leading in the polls.

Friedrich Merz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is polling in first place with around 30% of support alongside its affiliate party the CSU, has described wind power as a ""transitional technology."" Speaking to public broadcaster ZDF late last year, he said he hoped ""ugly"" wind turbines could be dismantled eventually, ""because they do not fit into the landscape.""

The far-right Alternative fuer Deutschland, which is second in national polls and expected to secure around 20% of votes, took the rhetoric even further. The party's chancellor candidate Alice Weidel has threatened to tear down all wind turbines, which she reportedly labeled as ""windmills of shame."" The AfD has called climate change into question and has frequently dismissed actions taken to tackle the environmental crisis.

Wind power, a form of renewable energy used to generate electricity, is considered important in the transition away from fossil fuels.

Wolf-Peter Schill, an energy economist at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin), said some of the ""wind power-bashing"" during the election campaign has been ""absurd"" at times, particularly from the AfD.

""The AfD is, in many respects, a nightmare — also in terms of their wind power takes, but I think it is not super relevant as they will not be in power,"" Schill told CNBC over video call.

Despite the AfD polling in second place, all other major parties in Germany have so far committed to not entering a coalition government with them, meaning they will likely form part of the opposition after the election.

Kentucky faces devastating flooding with 8 dead and more than a thousand rescued,"This photo provided by the Warren County, Kentucky., Sheriff's Office shows a partially submerged car outside of Bowling Green, Kentucky, on Saturday, Feb. 15, 2025.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Severe flooding has wreaked havoc across Kentucky, leading to more than 1,000 rescues as emergency teams race to help those trapped by rising waters. At least eight fatalities have been confirmed, with officials warning that the death toll will likely rise as search and rescue efforts continue.

""This is one of the most serious weather events we've dealt with in at least a decade,"" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said Sunday.

The fatalities reported stemmed from several counties, including Hard, Pike and Clay, with many incidents involving vehicles attempting to navigate floodwaters. Beshear emphasized the importance of staying off roadways to prevent further loss of life.

A mother and her 7-year-old child were killed in Kentucky when the car they were in was swept away by flood waters in Hart County near Interstate 65, a county official told WBKO-TV. Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said the two were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said.

Nearly 40,000 residents are without power, 9,800 service connections lack water and 26,000 are under a boil water advisory, authorities said at the Sunday press conference. Pike County School District announced Sunday that it will be closed until further notice.

Beshear said Sunday that President Trump had approved his request for disaster relief funding.

"Op-ed: 5 steps to help you financially recover after a wildfire, from a California-based financial advisor","An aerial view of homes destroyed in the Palisades Fire on January 27, 2025 in Pacific Palisades, California. Mario Tama | Getty Images

When the Los Angeles wildfires started dominating social media feeds, I reached out to a dear friend and client to check in. ""We just found out an hour ago, our house is gone,"" he replied. Enduring a wildfire or any other natural disaster can be emotionally and financially overwhelming. Here in Southern California, many of our clients and community are displaced and in shock by what the flames have taken. Families are trying to navigate the insurance red tape, worrying about where they will live and trying to make difficult decisions — such as if they can afford to rebuild or if they need to absorb the losses and move on.

While rebuilding or restoring stability is challenging, taking specific steps can help you regain control of your finances and better prepare for future emergencies:

1. Ensure your safety and apply for disaster aid

Register for assistance immediately. The Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, provide help including temporary shelter, emergency financial assistance and emotional support. Apply for disaster relief at disasterassistance.gov, and see if your state has wildfire or disaster-specific aid programs.

2. Assess your financial situation

Take inventory of accessible financial resources, including savings accounts, emergency funds or credit card limits for immediate needs. List financial obligations — such as rent, mortgages and utility bills — and begin looking into payment deferral options.

3. Adjust spending and budgeting

If you work with a financial advisor, let them know what has transpired. We've had clients recently tell us they've lost their homes and had to evacuate, and we are putting notations on their accounts and discussing short-term liquidity/income needs. Use free budgeting tools to track spending. Prioritize spending on essentials such as food, water, housing, and medication. Cancel subscriptions, defer large purchases and cut non-essential expenses to preserve cash flow.

watch now

Consider temporarily reducing the amount of money you are saving for retirement in order to build a bigger financial cushion to help you now. Contact utility companies, credit card issuers and other lenders to let them know your situation and negotiate payment plans or request hardship assistance. Many companies offer disaster forbearance programs that allow you to defer payments without penalty.

4. Protect your credit

If personal documents such as Social Security cards are lost or stolen after a disaster, freeze your credit at all three major credit rating agencies. You can always unfreeze your credit once the crisis has passed if you need to borrow. Also freeze any credit cards not in your possession. In many cases, you can do this easily in the card issuer's app or online. It's always a good idea to set up push notifications of any charges that occur. This way you can make sure all the charges are true and yours.

Coca-Cola says it will sell more soda in plastic bottles if aluminum tariffs take effect,"Trump on Monday raised tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports to 25% from 10%, starting next month. The action is widely seen as taking aim at China, although the U.S. imports little steel directly from the country.

""As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,"" Quincey said on the company's earnings conference call. ""For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, etc.,"" Quincey added.

Coca-Cola will shift more of its packaging from aluminum to plastic bottles if President Donald Trump implements his latest wave of tariffs, CEO James Quincey said Tuesday.

Quincey downplayed the financial hit for Coca-Cola from the tariffs, although he said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that the company buys some aluminum from Canada.

""I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,"" Quincey said on the conference call. ""It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure,"" the CEO added.

In addition to shifting to more plastic packaging, Coca-Cola can also blunt the effects of duties on its business by finding domestic aluminum sources and increasing the price for customers, Quincey added.

Aluminum is generally more expensive than plastic, but it is also infinitely recyclable and one of the most commonly recycled materials. In recent years, the company has shifted to adding more aluminum packaging options, such as canned Dasani and Smartwater.

PET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is a lightweight plastic that can be easily recycled but is recycled at a lower rate than aluminum. The recycling rate of PET bottles and jars was 29.1% in 2018, compared with the recycling rate of aluminum beer and soft drink cans at 50.4% in the same year, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Even as Coca-Cola has tried to use more aluminum, the company has been named the world's worst polluter by Greenpeace for six straight years for its single-use plastic usage.

The world won't be able to release its grip on coal anytime soon. ""Nothing can destroy coal,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said at the recent World Economic Forum. ""Not the weather, not a bomb."" U.S. exports of coal have been rising steadily to satisfy growing global demand for the world's dirtiest fossil fuel, even though its domestic consumption has decreased. On top of that, the world's coal capacity reached a new record high of nearly 2,175 gigawatts in 2024, data from Global Energy Monitor showed on Feb. 6. Coal capacity is the overall power output that can be generated from coal-fired power plants.

""The global shift away from coal remains challenging, largely driven by rising demand in Asia, even as Europe and the U.S. see significant declines in coal consumption,"" said Dorothy Mei, project manager for Global Energy Monitor's Global Coal Mine Tracker. Global coal demand is also expected to have breached another fresh record high of 8.77 billion tonnes in 2024, and will remain at similar levels until 2027, the International Energy Agency predicted.

The main culprits?

China recently reported that its coal imports surged 14.4% to a record high in 2024, amounting to 542.7 million metric tons compared with 474.42 million tons the year before. The world's second largest economy is also the largest coal consumer globally, accounting for more than 56% of global demand in 2023, latest figures by IEA showed. China's record-high coal stockpiling strategy is largely geared toward preparing the country for potential power shortages caused by extreme weather events, said Mei.

There is little focus on using energy efficiently, when coal is so cheap. Dave Jones Ember Energy

Hydropower, wind and solar energy made up almost 30% of China's electricity mix in 2023, data from energy think tank Ember Energy showed. When hydropower output drops as a result of insufficient rainfall, the Chinese government often relies on coal power to ensure energy security, Mei added. ""Additionally, another major barrier is not the availability of renewable energy infrastructure, but the difficulty of transmitting solar and wind power across provinces,"" she said, adding that coal will continue to be a ""critical energy backbone"" in China until grid integration and management is fully developed across the entire country. In India, climate-induced extreme heat has led to soaring energy demand for cooling, and clean energy sources are not built fast enough to meet the country's growing power demand, said Mei.

India's focus on economic and infrastructure development has also boosted the consumption of cement and steel, industries that are heavily reliant on coal, according to analysts CNBC spoke to. The South Asian nation's demand for steel is set to grow by 8-9% in 2025, outpacing that of other economies, owing to a pickup in steel-intensive construction in the infrastructure and residential sectors, data from consulting firm Crisil showed. As recently as last December, India extended its directive for imported coal-based power plants to run at full capacity until Feb. 28. But that's not to say that India has been neglecting its renewable energy targets. The country has set an ambitious goal of fulfilling 50% of its electricity needs through renewable energy by 2030. And it has made progress. And as of last October, renewables account for more than 46.3% of the country's electricity generation capacity, according to India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.

Beyond China and India

Outside of India and China, other top countries building new coal plants are Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, Global Energy Monitor noted. Vietnam is expected to have surpassed Taiwan as the world's fifth largest importer of coal, after the country's coal imports reached a record high in more than a decade last year. Indonesia's coal production rose to around 831 million tons to notch a fresh high last year, data from the country's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources showed. And the share of coal in Philippines' electricity mix surpassed that of China in 2023, becoming Southeast Asia's most coal-dependent country, Ember Energy reported. ""There is little focus on using energy efficiently, when coal is so cheap,"" said Dave Jones, an electricity analyst at energy think tank Ember Energy. Strong coal demand in Asia across the board is also partly a consequence of the surge in gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, given that a number of major thermal coal importers like China, India and Vietnam had scaled back plans for gas-based power buildouts following the high gas prices that ensued, said Ian Roper, commodity strategist at Astris Advisory Japan KK.

The AI factor

Global electricity consumption is expected to keep rising in 2025, the IEA said. ""The world needs more energy, and it needs it now,"" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. ""For the global economy to grow, it needs efficient, cost-effective, and reliable energy supply sources,"" he told CNBC.

Artificial intelligence has also accelerated the world's need for energy. Reports have shown that power needs driven by data centers around the world will also prolong the demand for coal. ""The U.S., China and the world are in a race for AI superiority,"" said Tim Winter, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. AI data centers are huge power users, making it harder to retire a reliable and affordable energy source such as coal, he explained. By 2030, electricity demand from data centers could exceed 35 GW, more than double the 17 GW recorded in 2022, a report by Moody's Ratings showed.

L.A. wildfire victims face financial anxiety amid recovery: 'The uncertainty is very unsettling',"Homes burn above Pacific Coast Highway during the Palisades Fire on Jan. 8, 2025, in Pacific Palisades, Calif. Photo by Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images

Alicia Kalvin awoke the morning of Jan. 7 to an urgent text from a friend: ""There's a fire on your street."" She hurried outside, alarmed to see red skies and low-flying planes dumping water. ""I have to get out of here,"" thought Kalvin, 53, who lives in the Pacific Palisades of Los Angeles. Back inside, she glanced out the bathroom window and saw a hellish scene unfolding. It was a neighbor's house engulfed in flames, embers spewing into her own yard. Kalvin frantically threw on clothing. She grabbed her purse, her dog, a can of dog food and her mother's ashes before fleeing her childhood home. She didn't get an evacuation warning. Flames licked the hills of the Los Angeles enclave as Kalvin drove away. She says she's had nightmares ever since. Three days later, she returned to the area with a police escort. ""I promised myself I wouldn't look, but of course I looked,"" said Kalvin. ""It looks like 10 nuclear bombs went off. The whole neighborhood was just leveled — markets, churches, schools. It looked like a war zone.""

In one sense, Kalvin is lucky because her home, somehow, is still standing. But questions about her financial future abound — as they do for thousands of L.A. residents whose lives were upended by the recent wildfires. There's significant damage to Kalvin's home. Some sections of the exterior, including the roof, are scorched; the landscaping and artificial lawn are destroyed; the interior smells of smoke; and ash, blown in through broken windows, blankets the hallways, Kalvin said. She's trying to untangle what her home insurance policy — the California FAIR plan, the state's insurer of last resort, which steps in when residents can't obtain coverage elsewhere — might cover. ""I'm very concerned at how much I'm going to have to spend if and when I fix up this house,"" said Kalvin, who is single and doesn't have kids. ""Because insurance won't cover everything."" Even before the Palisades Fire, Kalvin faced financial challenges. Work has dried up in Hollywood in recent years; Kalvin — an educator hired to teach child actors on television, movie and commercial sets — has had trouble finding gigs. She collects unemployment some weeks and funds income shortfalls with savings originally earmarked for retirement. ""My future is very up in the air,"" she said. ""And the uncertainty is very unsettling.""

'There are no answers right now'

The recent wildfires that erupted in Greater Los Angeles — fueled by hurricane-force winds and exceptionally dry conditions, exacerbated by climate change — are estimated to be among the costliest in U.S. history. They've killed at least 29 people. AccuWeather estimates the blazes caused more than $250 billion in total damage and economic loss. S&P Global Ratings projects the L.A. fires will cause roughly $40 billion of insured losses. That sum would exceed the roughly $13 billion of the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif., in 2018, which was the costliest blaze in U.S. history. ""There are all sorts of costs associated with a disaster,"" said Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies household risk to natural hazards and climate change. ""They pile up, and many Americans don't have a [financial] cushion to rely on,"" Rumbach said. ""Our main way of dealing with that as an economy is going into debt. That lingers for a long time.""

The fires, largely contained, were still burning as of Thursday. The blazes — the largest being the Palisades and Eaton Fires — have scorched more than 50,000 acres, an area exceeding the size of San Francisco, and destroyed more than 16,000 structures. Most of those structures have been residential houses, S&P Global Ratings analysts wrote in a recent note. The disaster pushed thousands of L.A. residents into one of the nation's most expensive housing markets overnight. They were left with countless financial questions, compounding deep emotional scars: Considerations like where to live, how to clean up, whether to rebuild — and how to afford it all. ""Individuals are dealing with insurance, mortgages, the replacement cost of belongings, temporary housing,"" said Sam Bakhshandehpour, 49, who's lived in the Pacific Palisades for 13 years. ""There are lots of near- and long-term variables and frankly there are no answers right now.""

I'm very concerned at how much I'm going to have to spend if and when I fix up this house. Because insurance won't cover everything. Alicia Kalvin Pacific Palisades resident

Bakhshandehpour, an investment banker turned restaurateur, said the extent of damage to his home is unclear. He wants to continue living in the Palisades, which he calls an ""oasis"" in L.A. — but acknowledges cleanup of debris and toxic materials and repair to local infrastructure ""could be years."" Indeed, the recovery period for L.A. residents could be two to five years or longer, Rumbach estimates. Some residents may never be able to move back. ""Even if there is a desire on the part of the homeowners [to rebuild], it is unclear as to whether the land will be re-zoned such that it can no longer be developed,"" according to S&P Global Ratings.

A 'massive' financial drain

Bakhshandehpour was able to find an unfurnished apartment in the interim. But furnishing a home from scratch has been a ""massive"" financial drain, he said. There are some financial backstops that can help allay such displacement costs. For example, victims may qualify for FEMA assistance. Applicants can get up to $770 upfront for basic needs like food and shelter while the government vets their application for more aid, potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars.

During a state of emergency, California law also requires home insurers to issue a cash advance worth at least 30% of a policyholder's ""dwelling"" insurance limit, up to $250,000, without filing an itemized claim. They must also advance at least four months of coverage for living expenses. ""There is no comparison to the dollars you get from a home insurance policy,"" said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ""It has long been the most important source of funds to repair and rebuild, much more than any government program, for the vast majority of people."" Some insurers are paying policyholders even more than the law demands, Ricardo Lara, the California insurance commissioner, said Jan. 23. However, others ""are not adhering"" to those consumer protections, Lara said.

Only a 'ghost town hellscape' remains

The rules on advance insurance payments only apply for policyholders with a ""total loss."" But Julia Pollak's home is considered a ""partial"" loss. Her insurer, State Farm, paid a $15,000 advance on the home's contents and also authorized coverage for two months of living expenses. Both amounts are less than guarantees for those with a total loss. Her house, in the Marquez Knolls part of the Pacific Palisades, is damaged but still standing — a white home now surrounded by ""wasteland,"" she said. ""There's a row of seven houses standing. All the rest are gone,"" said Pollak, a labor economist. ""My house now looks out on a ghost town hellscape."" She and her family — a husband and four kids, including a newborn — are in limbo in many respects.

For one, the insurance proceeds they've received so far aren't enough to commit to a long-term lease, Pollak said. ""I looked into liquidating my 401(k) for emergency purposes, but the tax consequences are not very nice,"" Pollak said. ""So, I'm going to try not to do it."" Thus far, the family has hopped from AirBnb to AirBnb. They don't know where they'll live after Feb. 5, when their current rental expires on a two-bedroom in Santa Monica.

7 steps homeowners and renters should take after a wildfire

Wildfire victims may receive a one-time $770 payment State Farm urged Pollak to use its third-party vendor to find future temporary housing — a cost the insurer would pay for directly, rather than via reimbursement. As of Thursday, Pollak was awaiting approval for certain properties she'd identified. She worries they'll be snapped up in the interim. ""As Feb. 5 approaches, I am getting pretty nervous,"" she said. Then, there are longer-term questions. The back side of their home is scorched. Everything inside reeks of smoke; various consultants have warned the smell won't disappear unless insulation and ducting is replaced. Contractors have recommended a ""full gut"" and a replacement of all porous, hard-to-clean items like carpets, couches and upholstered beds, Pollak said. They must wait for the insurer's determination.

To stay or to go?

There's an additional tension here: It may be difficult to stay in the Palisades, but it's also financially difficult to leave. Pollak and others she knows whose homes are still standing worry insurers will deem their homes livable in a few months. She wonders, would they be residing in a construction zone for five years with no neighbors, businesses or schools nearby?

Pollak and her husband bought their home in 2019 for about $2.75 million. Its value had grown to about $3.8 million before the wildfires, according to a Redfin estimate — the family's biggest financial asset. Now, they likely can't sell or rent it for anything close to pre-fire value, Pollak said. ""Ideally, we'd keep it and enjoy it in five to 10 years when it blossoms again,"" Pollak said. ""But the carrying costs are so high that we can't pay the mortgage without living there and also pay for comparable accommodation elsewhere.""

An uncertain future

For all she and her family have endured, Pollak considers herself lucky: At least they have insurance. Many insurers have stopped writing policies in California or limited their exposure due to wildfire risk. Homeowners who lost coverage may not have renewed it, while others may have foregone insurance altogether in the face of higher premiums — and those rates will likely increase in the future after the L.A. fires, said S&P Global. Two-thirds or more of L.A. fire victims will find they were underinsured, said Bach of United Policyholders. That means their insurance policy won't cover the full cost of rebuilding or repairing property. For example, 36% of victims who filed insurance claims after the 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder County, Colorado, were ""severely"" underinsured, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Their coverage was less than 75% of the actual cost to fix their home, the study found. That means policyholders rebuilding a $1 million home would need an extra $250,000 or more out of pocket, Tony Cookson, finance professor at the University of Colorado Boulder and a co-author of the study, said in a statement.

Tesla fourth-quarter results miss estimates as automotive revenue drops 8%,"In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Tesla reported earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter that missed analysts' estimates. The stock initially fell in after-hours trading before rebounding. Here is how the company did compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: 73 cents adjusted vs. 76 cents expected

73 cents adjusted vs. 76 cents expected Revenue: $25.71 billion vs. $27.26 billion expected Tesla's revenue increased just 2% from $25.17 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue fell 8% to $19.8 billion from $21.56 billion in the same quarter last year, and of that, $692 million came from regulatory credits. Operating income declined 23% year over year to $1.6 billion. The company cited reduced average selling prices across its Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X lines as a major reason for the decline. Net income dropped 71% from a year earlier to $2.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, from $7.93 billion, or $2.27 a share. Last year's net income figure was bolstered by a $5.9 billion one-time noncash tax benefit.

Tesla's earnings report follows a steep rally in the company's stock price tied to the election of President Donald Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was the biggest backer of Trump's campaign efforts and is now leading the president's new government efficiency advisory board. The company's stock price has rallied sharply since Trump's victory in November as investors bet that Musk's influence would lead to both favorable policies and less oversight of his companies. Operating margin for the quarter came in at 6.2%, narrowing from 8.2% during the same period a year earlier and 10.8% in the previous quarter. In early January, Tesla reported deliveries for the fourth quarter of 495,570. For the full year, deliveries came in at about 1.8 million, marking the company's first annual decline. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

Hefty discounts

To end 2024, Tesla offered a range of discounts on inventory vehicles and special discounts for buyers in North America who were referred by another Tesla customer. In China, Tesla cut prices on its popular Model Y SUVs before debuting a refreshed version, the Model Y Juniper. In its shareholder deck on Wednesday, Tesla noted that ""affordability remains top of mind for customers."" The company said it intends to ""review every aspect"" of its cost of goods sold per vehicle to help make its EVs affordable.

Musk has been telling investors in recent quarters to focus less on the core business as it exists today and more on a future of autonomy and robotics. In October, Tesla drummed up excitement among fans by showing off an early prototype version of a Cybercab at its ""We, Robot"" event. However, Tesla still does not produce robotaxis. Instead, the company sells a premium version of its partially automated driving system called FSD, short for Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Meanwhile, Google's Waymo has a growing commercial robotaxi offering in some U.S. markets, and China's WeRide and Pony.ai are testing and commercially operating driverless ride-hailing services. While Tesla did not give specific guidance for this year, the company said, ""we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025."" It also reiterated plans to ""unlock an unsupervised FSD option"" eventually and said it expects to ""begin launching"" its driverless ride-hailing business ""later this year in parts of the U.S."" Musk said in the opening remarks of Tesla's earnings call that the company would be ""launching unsupervised Full Self-Driving as a paid service"" in Austin in June. ""We already have Teslas operating autonomously at our factory in Fremont and will soon be doing that at our factory in Texas,"" Musk said. Musk acknowledged that he has made big self-driving promises and predictions that have not come through for many years. He said, with a laugh, ""I'm telling you there's a d--- wolf this time. And you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf!"" Musk added later in the call that Tesla will ""look to release Unsupervised FSD in many regions"" of the U.S. by the end of this year. He said there is ""significant interest"" from ""a number of major car companies about licensing"" the technology, but without providing any names or offering a timeline. The company uses online forum Say Technologies to solicit and choose investor questions for executives to answer on the calls. As of Tuesday, more than 100 inquiries had flooded in about Tesla's plans around autonomous vehicle technology. Additionally, many shareholders submitted questions about Musk's obligations at the White House, and about the effect of his political and public conduct on the company. Musk has recently made offensive jokes and gestures making light of the Holocaust, and has promoted Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant party AfD, or Alternative fur Deutschland, ahead of the country's elections in February. As reported earlier by CNBC, Tesla's brand value shed $15 billion in 2024, owing to multiple factors including the company's aging lineup of EVs, and Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and conduct, according to research by Brand Finance. Tesla's energy business fared much better in the quarter than its core automotive unit. The company reported energy generation and storage revenue of $3.06 billion for the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2024, up 113% from the same period in the prior year.

UK finance minister backs expansion of London's Heathrow Airport to boost struggling economy,"British Airways Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft spotted flying on final approach over the roofs of the houses of Myrtle avenue for landing at London Heathrow Airport LHR in the UK. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images

U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves on Wednesday unveiled plans to deliver a shot in the arm for the country's ailing economy, signaling she backs the long-delayed expansion of one of the world's busiest airports. In a major growth speech in Oxfordshire, Reeves said that a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport was ""badly needed,"" adding it would boost investment, support economic expansion and potentially create over 100,000 jobs. Citing research from the consultancy Frontier Economics, Reeves suggested a third runway at Heathrow could increase gross domestic product by 0.43% by 2050, with much of that boost going to areas outside of London and the southeast of the country. Her comments came amid a series of project announcements to reform the U.K.'s planning system, including the redevelopment of Manchester United's soccer stadium in north England and investment in the Oxford-Cambridge ""growth corridor."" Reeves said ""low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight."" She promised to go ""further and faster"" to fulfil what she's called her ""number one priority"" of kickstarting the U.K.'s economy. The ruling center-left Labour Party has repeatedly pledged to prioritize economic growth, with Reeves last week telling reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that this mission is more important to the government than its net-zero emissions target. Reeves on Wednesday described net zero as the ""industrial opportunity of the 21st century,"" saying there is no trade off between economic growth and the energy transition.

Heathrow CEO welcomes expansion plans

Supporters of a third runway at Heathrow say it would better connect the U.K. to long-haul destinations, boost trade, jobs and, ultimately, economic growth. Environmental campaign groups, meanwhile, have sharply criticized the expansion plans at Europe's busiest hub, saying economic growth can be achieved without undermining the country's climate targets. Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye welcomed Reeves' comments regarding the airport's potential expansion. ""Heathrow is the UK's gateway to growth and prosperity. A third runway and the infrastructure that comes with it would unlock billions of pounds of private money to stimulate the UK supply chain during construction,"" Woldbye said in a statement. ""With strict environmental safeguards, it would demonstrate that by growing our economy responsibly we can ensure our commitments to future generations are delivered,"" he added.

The Treasury has also reportedly been considering a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport and increased capacity at Luton Airport. Britain's economic output returned to growth in November last year, although the expansion was weaker-than-expected at just 0.1%. A report published last year found that the U.K.'s net-zero economy, which spans sectors including renewables and green finance, expanded by 9% in 2023 — in sharp contrast to the meager growth seen in the wider economy. ""The green economy is growing fast, and with greater government support it could expand even quicker. It needn't be a question of growth or the environment when we can have both — especially when the green economy is outpacing other sectors,"" Rosie Downes, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement.

'No easy routes' to growth

Reeves had been widely expected to announce that the government would back a third runway at Heathrow Airport, after reportedly telling Labour Party lawmakers earlier this week that there were ""no easy routes"" to growth and that she had to start saying ""yes"" to new projects to boost the economy. The previous Conservative government, which supports Heathrow's expansion, appointed an independent Airports Commission to look into the potential benefits of a third runway. The report concluded in 2015 that the economic benefits to passengers and the wider economy were worth up to £61 billion ($76 billion) over 60 years. The expansion could lead to lower fares, fewer delays, better connections to destinations including Asia and South America, and up to 77,000 additional jobs by 2030, the report found.

Norway is set to become the first country in the world to effectively erase gasoline and diesel cars from its new car market. Despite its vast oil and gas reserves, the Nordic country has long been recognized as a global leader in sustainable transportation. Its electric vehicle (EV) sales have increased from less than 1% of total auto sales in 2010 to a whopping 88.9% last year — and this trend doesn't show any sign of slowing. Data published by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, which is responsible for the country's national road network, found EVs accounted for more than 96% of new cars sold in the first few weeks of this year. It puts Norway within touching distance of going fully electric — realizing a non-binding goal that was first established by lawmakers back in 2017. Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association (NEVA), which represents electric car owners in the country, expects Norway to hit this target. In fact, Bu said plans were underway to hold a party to celebrate what she said would be a historic milestone. ""We have already invited a lot of politicians and different stakeholders to a party on the 13th of February because, we don't know exactly until the year has ended, but everyone says we will end somewhere between 95% and 100% this year,"" Bu told CNBC via video call. ""So, in times like this with [President Donald] Trump withdrawing the U.S. from the climate agreement and everything, I think we need to celebrate the achievements that we have managed,"" she added.

Alongside a push to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris Agreement, Trump also took aim at several low-carbon technologies last week. This included revoking predecessor Joe Biden's non-binding executive order which targeted 50% electric vehicle sales by 2030. Trump's executive order, which was criticized by EV advocates, was designed to ""eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate and promote true consumer choice.""

A 'new normal'

Norway's Deputy Transport Minister Cecilie Knibe Kroglund said long-term and consistent policies designed to support the uptake of EVs — rather than imposing measures to ban the use of internal combustion engine vehicles — had been pivotal to the country's transition. Comparatively, the European Union adopted legislation to effectively ban sales of new carbon-emitting cars from 2035, while the U.K. has said it will ban the sale of new cars powered solely by internal combustion engines by 2030.

Some of Norway's EV incentives include a VAT exemption, discounts on road and parking taxes and access to bus lanes. The government has also heavily invested in public charging infrastructure, and many Norwegian households are able to charge their cars at home. Kroglund described the changes as a ""new normal"" for the country of 5.5 million. ""Transport is a big part of the answer for climate-friendly solutions. So, we need to make sure that some of the success we have had with cars can be used for other areas of the transport sector,"" Kroglund told CNBC via video call. Kroglund said the country planned to fully transition to electric city buses in 2025, while making heavy-duty vehicles 75% renewable by the end of the decade.

While new car sales in Norway are close to 100% electric, there are still plenty of vehicles with internal combustion engines on the road. NEVA's Bu said 28% of cars are fully electric at the national level, although this rises to over 40% in the capital Oslo. ""So many middle-aged men have come up to me to say: 'I was never going to get an electric car — not at all,' and next they say: 'But now I drive a …' and they tell me the model they drive and get all enthusiastic about the technology and everything,"" Bu said. ""Our whole society has gone through this mental shift. I mean, it's not like Norwegians are greener or more prone do this kind of thing than others. It was the policies that did it and people quickly understood and changed their thinking about this,"" she added.

The lack of an automaker lobby in Norway is thought to have benefitted the country's EV adoption rate over the years. Indeed, Bu said while there have frequently been political debates about the merits of transitioning away from internal combustion engines, those opposing the switch ""haven't been strong enough or organized enough.""

How do others compare?

By contrast to Norway's push to go fully electric, EVs accounted for 8.1% of total U.S. sales in 2024. That figure was up from a 7.8% share of the market in 2023, according to market research firm Cox Automotive. In the U.K., industry data showed that EVs made up nearly 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said Norway's EV leadership shows that it is possible for other countries to follow suit. ""Norway is a global front-runner, and in this respect also an example for other countries. Though, we also have to keep in mind that Norway is one of the most prosperous countries in Europe, which can easily afford relentless budgets,"" Luman told CNBC via email. ""Another point is that energy is relatively cheap in Norway (as large oil and gas exporter), which makes EVs more attractive. Most others can't meet that level — and think of what happened in Germany after the sudden phase out for subsidies for the general public following budget constraints,"" Luman said.

Why the home insurance model is broken,"A rash of fast-moving wildfires have wreaked havoc across Los Angeles in recent weeks. Following the outbreak of the Hughes fire, the structural toll of the January wildfires now exceeds 16,000. Early estimates place the economic toll of the fires between $250 billion and $275 billion. Now, property insurers in the state are facing a historic payout, an estimated $40 billion.

""Preliminary loss estimates are running in the range of $30 to $50 billion"", says David Sampson, president and CEO of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. ""That will be the largest fire related catastrophe globally in history.""

For many California homeowners the situation is dire. Several major property insurance companies, including the state's largest insurer, State Farm, announced pullbacks in coverage in recent years. Some have restricted underwriting in high-risk ZIP codes, others have pulled out of the state all together. Homeowners who have lost their home insurance are largely turning to what is called the 'insurer of last resort', the California FAIR Plan.

Malibu homeowner Joan Zoloth is one of more than 449,000 Californians covered under the FAIR Plan.

""I had to scramble for as many people do in California, had to scramble for insurance,"" says Zoloth. ""I called agents and said, 'What do I do?' And they said, 'You know, it's going to be very hard for you to get insurance'"".

Along with private insurers, the FAIR Plan also faces a massive payout, an estimated $8 billion in losses. An amount the FAIR Plan simply can't cover. As of Jan. 10, 2025, it had only $377 million to pay claims, as well as an additional $5.78 billion in reinsurance.



It's not just Californians who are grappling with losing insurance due to severe climate risks and worsening disasters. According to Realtor.com, 44.8% of all U.S. homes are in areas that face at least one severe or extreme climate risk. That includes flooding, wildfires, heat, wind and air quality risks. Insurers have also been limiting underwriting in parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas as natural disasters grow in intensity and cost.

Here's why Trump's pursuit of Greenland is really about the control over the Arctic,"President Donald Trump has reiterated his desire to buy Greenland, and refused to rule out using military or economic coercion to achieve his goal of controlling the autonomous territory of Denmark. .

However, the United States isn't the only country with an eye on the region. In 2018, a Chinese state-owned company bid roughly $550 million to expand two airports in Greenland, but the bid was ultimately withdrawn.

Meanwhile, Russia has been reopening old Soviet military bases across the Arctic since 2015, including Nagurskoye, located just 600 miles off the northern coast of Greenland.

""Greenland is almost a kind of ground zero for how the Arctic has become more and more geopolitically and strategically significant,"" according to Kalus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London.

As China and Russia expand their influence in the Arctic, Greenland's location has become vital to America's ballistic missile warning system.

""With China's rise and its tripling the size of its ICBM ballistic missile arsenal, Greenland plays a national defense role because of its geography,"" said Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

Greenland's location also presents a unique economic opportunity, thanks to its proximity to Arctic shipping routes. Shipping over Arctic routes saw a 37% increase between 2013 and 2023, according to the Arctic Council.

In 2018, China also announced its intent to construct a ""Polar Silk Road"" linking China and Europe through the Arctic Ocean.

""As the Arctic ice flow has changed in the recent past, and is projected to continue changing, opening up Arctic shipping routes, you have several lucrative potentials there,"" said Sadler.

Aerial firefighting companies' new challenge: Keeping up with demand,"In this article BAER Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

As out-of-control wildfires threatened thousands of Los Angeles residents earlier this month, the companies that fight infernos from the air raced to send their air tankers and water bombers to the area. It was supposed to be the off-season. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, has more than 60 fixed-wing and rotor-wing firefighting aircraft, which it calls the largest civil fleet of its kind. But the federal government, U.S. states and countries from Australia to Chile to South Korea hire companies that have their own private fleets of specially outfitted aircraft to help tame fires. ""I was lucky to have two"" aircraft available to help fight the flames, said Joel Kerley, CEO of 10 Tanker Air Carrier, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The company has a fleet of four converted DC-10 aircraft, known as very large air tankers, or VLATs.

The wildfire season in the U.S. normally runs from April to about November, when 10 Tanker and similar companies are under round-the-clock contracts with the U.S. Forest Service, a federal agency. In 2023, the U.S. Forest Service extended a 10-year contract worth as much as $7.2 billion to 10 Tanker and four other providers. Outside of those months, providers are generally on a call-when-needed basis. And demand for their services continues to rise, year-round, these firms say. Wildfires are expected to become even more prevalent and severe in the 21st century, according to the United Nations Environment Program. The United States Environmental Protection Agency said data appears to show that the area destroyed by wildfires in the U.S. has gone up over the last two decades. ""There's not enough air tankers to go around,"" said Kerley, the former aviation manager for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the Department of the Interior.

Some countries that have faced severe wildfires in recent years, like Australia, have been building up their own fleets of firefighting aircraft. Kerley said they will need to expand their fleets or companies like his will have to get bigger to meet growing demand. Kerley said the Palisades and Eaton fires were some of the most complicated to fight. Fed by hurricane-force winds, they leveled entire neighborhoods like Altadena and were some of the worst ever in California. They were also a reminder to firefighters, government officials and the public that fires could spring up when they're least expected. Those two fires have consumed more than 37,000 acres and damaged or destroyed over 16,000 homes, buildings and other structures, making them two of the most destructive wildfires ever in California. At least 28 people were killed, according to Cal Fire. Kerley said days into the new year he was asking his crews of pilots and mechanics to travel to blazes he equated to ""the Super Bowl"" of fire response. 10 Tanker's planes have dropped more than 273,000 gallons of fire retardant on the Eaton and Palisades fires. Both of those fires were largely contained as of Friday, but companies like Kerley's were still on call as the Hughes fire was spreading rapidly north of Los Angeles, prompting a new round of evacuations.

Since the devastating Los Angeles blazes struck during what is supposed to be the region's off-season for wildfires, some of 10 Tanker's aircraft were stuck in routine maintenance earlier on in the battle. And he wasn't alone. ""We're in heavy winter maintenance on all of our aircraft,"" said Sam Davis, CEO of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, which has a fleet of Canada-made Super Scoopers that scoop up water as they're flying along the water and dump the water near fires. They can make several trips on one flight. ""It was a push to get the first aircraft out the door,"" Davis said. In November, Bridger reported record revenue and profits for its third quarter, saying ""continued dry weather in the western U.S. kept multiple aircraft operating into November."" It increased its revenue estimates for the year to as much as $95 million from a previous range of between $70 million to $86 million. Growing fleets of new aircraft isn't easy or fast. Kevin McCullough, president of Aero Air, which also provides air tankers, sent some of its MD-87s to the Los Angeles fires. He said it can take about a year and a half to convert a jet into a tanker to fight fires. ""It isn't like you just throw a tank in and you're doing this,"" he said. ""You're completely modifying the aircraft and turning it into a fire bomber."" McCullough said development of these jet tankers were done privately, with hopes that there would eventually be government contracts for their services, but ""there were never any guarantees.""

How to fight fires from the air

Specially trained pilots drop water or fire retardant from the air to help assist firefighters on the ground. The heavy, bright-red fire retardant is generally dropped in front of fires, blocking the flames' path. ""The challenge of dropping water or retardant is when these fires break out, most of the time it's not in a flat area and not one of these blue-sky, calm-wind days,"" said Paul Petersen, executive director of the United Aerial Firefighters Association. Some of these pilots come from military backgrounds, while others shift over from passenger airlines, 10 Tanker's Kerley said. Aerial firefighting pilots' ages span decades. He has nearly 30 on staff. Eight mechanics are assigned to each of the company's DC-10s. ""It's an odd duck in terms of careers,"" Kerley said.

There's also natural forces to contend with: The fierce Santa Ana winds, which were blowing with hurricane force in early January, helped spread the Los Angeles-area fires and also grounded some planes early on from their aerial missions. The last DC-10 aircraft rolled off the McDonnell Douglas production line in nearby Long Beach, California, nearly four decades ago, but 10 Tanker's planes have been reoutfitted to carry and precisely drop 9,500 gallons of fire retardant.

Hughes Fire containment grows after thousands are forced to flee,"Inmate firefighters walk into uncontrolled fire to cut a fire line using only hand tools and chain saws at the Hughes Fire on January 22, 2025 in Castaic, California. David Mcnew | Getty Images

LOS ANGELES — Firefighters gained more ground Thursday on a fast-moving brush fire that erupted north of Los Angeles on Wednesday and within hours exploded to thousands of acres amid high winds, officials said. The Hughes Fire, which started near Castaic Lake, was 36% contained and had burned more than 10,000 acres by Thursday evening, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. No structures have been destroyed, officials said.

The fire had prompted mandatory evacuation orders Wednesday for more than 31,000 people. They had been lifted by Thursday afternoon, but around 54,900 people remained under an evacuation warning, meaning they should be prepared to leave if ordered, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. ""This fire was one of those tough, fast-moving Santa Ana wind-driven fires,"" Brent Pascua, a battalion chief with Cal Fire, said Thursday. The fire, which occurred as the region was under a warning for high winds and critical fire weather, erupted little more than two weeks after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires started in the Los Angeles area, killing at least 28 people and destroying thousands of homes.

The winds that fueled the Hughes Fire's spread Wednesday were not as powerful as the hurricane-force winds that fueled the Palisades and Eaton fires on Jan. 7, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. Those winds kept firefighting aircraft grounded.Experts have pointed to the link between climate change and the conditions that make fires like those that have roared across Los Angeles in recent weeks more likely.

Renewable energy giants appear relatively sanguine about U.S. President Donald Trump's anti-wind policies, describing the process of replacing fossil fuels with electrically powered products as ""absolutely unstoppable."" Trump, who promised a new ""golden age"" for America in his inaugural address on Monday, swiftly took aim at low-carbon energy initiatives. In a standalone executive order, which had been widely expected, the president temporarily suspended new or renewed leases for offshore and onshore wind projects and halted the leasing of wind power projects on the outer continental shelf. ""We are not going to do the wind thing. Big ugly windmills, they ruin your neighborhood,"" Trump told his supporters at the Capital One Area in Washington on Monday. He previously described wind turbines as an economic and environmental ""disaster."" The measures formed part of a much broader energy offensive designed to ""unleash"" already booming oil and gas production. This included declaring a national energy emergency, promoting fossil fuel drilling in Alaska and signing an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris Agreement.

Joe Kaeser, chairman of the supervisory board of Siemens Energy , one of the world's biggest renewables players, seemed unfazed by Trump's sweeping energy agenda. In fact, Kaeser considered the policies a ""slight plus"" for the German energy technology group. Shares of Siemens Energy jumped more than 8% on Wednesday morning, hitting a new 52-week high. ""We need to see what's behind all the executive orders and the policies. So far, I believe there are many areas where actually Siemens Energy benefits a lot,"" Kaeser told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. There will be uncertainty for low-carbon energy sectors, such as onshore and offshore wind, Kaeser said, before adding that Trump's measures were unlikely to directly impact Siemens Energy. That's partly because roughly 80% of the firm's wind market is in Europe, Kaeser said.

""So, I believe that doesn't move the needle. I'm much more worried about the European economies and how they deal with a very powerful nation, with a very powerful concept. We may or may not like it, because it's got some nationalistic type of things, but if we look at it from the view of the American people, we better get something going,"" Kaeser said. Beyond onshore and offshore wind, Kaeser said Siemens Energy was well positioned to capitalize from a ""booming"" electrification market. ""Think about the data centers, artificial intelligence, we have waiting times now on large gas turbines. Actually, customers are coming and saying, hey can I make a reservation and I'll pay you for a reservation? Just think about that. It hasn't happened for a long time,"" Kaeser said. ""I believe the electrification age has just begun. Whether that's gas turbines or wind or solar or something else, we've got everything, and the customers decide in the end. And one thing I believe one should not underestimate, the White House is not buying much [but] the customer does,"" he added.

'Very, very optimistic'

Spanish renewable energy giant Iberdrola was similarly bullish about the road to full electrification, describing the transition away from fossil fuels as ""absolutely unstoppable."" ""We are seeing that probably we are in the best moment for electrification,"" Ignacio Galán, executive chairman of Iberdrola, told CNBC at WEF on Tuesday. Galán cited soaring global demand for electrically powered data centers, low-emission vehicles as well as cooling and heating applications.

""All of those things require more electricity 24 hours a day. Our business in the United States is mostly in this area, which is networks … and the regulation depends on the state authority, so I think that is not really affected at all,"" Galán said. ""Depending on the legislation, we will make more or less investment in another part of our business,"" he added, referring to Trump's energy policy. ""We are very, very optimistic about the United States and the future,"" Galán said.

Wind power woes

Shares of some European wind power giants fell shortly after Trump took aim at wind power plans. Denmark's Orsted, which recently announced a roughly $1.7 billion impairment charge on U.S. projects, dipped 4.4% on Wednesday morning, extending steep losses from the previous session. The rapidly growing offshore wind sector has endured a torrid time in recent years, hampered by rising costs, supply chain disruption and higher interest rates.

Trump's climate retreat stirs a sense of déjà vu — and prompts a warning from the UN,"US President Donald Trump holds letter to the UN stating the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement during the inaugural parade inside Capital One Arena, in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.

U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement for a second time creates a leadership vacuum that other countries can benefit from, according to the United Nations' top climate official.

Trump on Monday signed an executive order to pull the U.S. out of the world's biggest coordinated effort to tackle rising temperatures. He also announced a ""national energy emergency"" to pare back many Biden-era environmental regulations and vowed to ramp up fossil fuel production.

The order to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, which was widely expected, follows a similar move by the first Trump administration in 2017 and deals a major blow to global efforts to protect the environment.

The 2015 Paris Agreement is a framework designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to ""well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" over the long term.

""We have been here before,"" United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said during a CNBC-moderated panel at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.

A key difference between Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and Monday's executive order, Stiell said, was the ""significant momentum"" to combat global warming in the intervening eight years.

""The world is undergoing an energy transition that is unstoppable. Last year alone, over $2 trillion was invested in the transition and that compares to $1 trillion in fossil fuels, so the signal is absolutely clear,"" Stiell said.

""Anyone who steps back from this significant forward momentum creates a vacuum that others will fill and will benefit from. So, I think this kind of the framing context that we find ourselves in 14 hours after that statement,"" he added.",2025-01-21 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/davos-trumps-paris-climate-agreement-retreat-prompts-warning-from-un.html,cnbc
"Tesla brand value shed $15 billion in 2024 with aging lineup, Musk at helm, researchers found","In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

The value of Tesla's brand fell by 26% in 2024, a second straight annual decline, with factors including an aging lineup of vehicles, and CEO Elon Musk's ""antagonism,"" according to research and consulting firm Brand Finance. Tesla's brand value now stands at an estimated $43 billion, down from $58.3 billion at the beginning of 2024 and $66.2 billion at the start of 2023, the firm said in its annual ranking. Toyota is the most valuable brand in autos at $64.7 billion, with Mercedes close behind at $53 billion, the researchers found. Brand Finance, based in London, conducts comprehensive consumer surveys and analyzes thousands of companies' financials, looking at revenue, licensing agreements, margins and more, to estimate the monetary value of brands. The assessments include corporate brands and the sub-brands associated with individual product lines. As part of the firm's ranking this year, Brand Finance analyzed answers from about 175,000 survey respondents worldwide, including about 16,000 people who shared their views on Tesla. The results show that the way consumers view Tesla is very different from Wall Street's assessment. Tesla's stock price soared 63% last year, reaching a record in December, after investors snapped up the shares following Donald Trump's election victory the prior month. Musk contributed $277 million to help propel Trump and other Republican candidates to victory, and is poised to wield influence in the administration to the benefit of his companies. When it comes to the broader public, Brand Finance CEO David Haigh says that Musk's political rhetoric and public persona has its downsides. ""There are people who think he's wonderful, but many that don't,"" Haigh said. ""If you are buying electric vehicles, his persona is highly likely to impact your view of whether or not you want to buy one of his company's cars, but that's only one of many factors."" On key measures like ""consideration,"" ""reputation"" and ""recommendation,"" Tesla's scores declined across the board in major markets where it operates factories and sells its cars -- the U.S., Europe and Asia, Brand Finance found.

A consideration score shows whether people would consider buying from a brand. A reputation score shows how highly respondents regard a brand on average on a scale from 1 to 10. And a recommendation score indicates whether or not people are likely to speak favorably about a brand. Tesla saw significant declines in its scores in Europe, where its consideration score dropped from 21% to 16% on average from 2024 to 2025. Competitors Mercedes and BYD beat Tesla especially on consideration and recommendation scores outside the U.S. Tesla maintained a high loyalty score of 90% in the U.S., however. That means customers who already owned a Tesla vehicle were likely to keep driving it over the next 12 months. But Tesla's recommendation score in the U.S. dropped from 8.2 out of 10 to 4.3. Haigh said Tesla's declining scores and brand value are a sign that the company's ""pulling power is weakening."" There's a risk, he said, that ""Tesla won't be able to sell so many products, and it won't be able to sell at such high prices as it did before."" There were troubling signs already. Tesla's deliveries for 2024 declined by about 1% to 1.79 million, even though demand for battery electric vehicles increased worldwide. In the U.S. Tesla's, market share in EVs dropped to 49% from 55% a year earlier, according to data from Cox Automotive. Tesla's brand strength index score, according to Brand Finance, has also dipped from just over 80 to just under 65. The score indicates how well a brand is doing compared to competitors on intangible measures. ""Unless Tesla can come up with a whole range of new products that will really excite consumers, and unless they can mitigate some of the antagonism caused by their leader, they will be seen as past their peak and will begin to go down,"" Haigh said. Measuring Musk Musk hasn't limited his political activity to the U.S. He has reportedly been in regular contact with with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, has praised and worked with Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and Argentina's Javier Milei and made public appearances with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. He recently endorsed Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and pressured British officials to release anti-immigrant Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, from prison. On Monday, during his public remarks after Trump's inauguration, Musk repeatedly used a gesture that historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, whose work focuses on fascism, described as ""a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one."" Musk didn't respond to requests for comment. When it comes to consumer attitudes, ""There'll be a small number that say, I really don't care what they do. I just want their product,"" said Haigh. ""There are other gradations of people who care, right through to those who say, I'm not touching that product on principle."" Tesla is unique in the tight association between the company's brand and its leader. With Tesla, ""It is very clear who the CEO is, that this person is in charge and their behavior will impact the company's reputation,"" Haigh said.

Brand Finance also evaluated other Musk-led brands, including X, aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX and, for the first time, SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet business. The overall brand value of X dropped 26% to $498 million from $673 million, the firm estimated. Simple awareness of the X brand dropped from 2022, when the company was still known as Twitter, from 94% to 78% today on an international level. Before Musk took over and renamed it, Twitter had a brand value of $5.7 billion in 2022. The name change drove part of the overall decline, according to Brand Finance, but so did the loss of users, advertisers and ad revenue. ""Twitter was very well known, very well-liked and attracted a lot of advertising,"" Haigh said. ""Overnight, when he changed it to X, according to our data, that reduced the value by about 75%. It went right down and has continued to go down."" For SpaceX, which Brand Finance began to assess at the start of 2024, the company's brand value has increased 11% to $3.8 billion. About 45% of people in the U.S. who responded to the survey were familiar with SpaceX, a high ranking for an aerospace and defense company. The Starlink brand, calculated separately from SpaceX, is valued at $2.4 billion, the firm found. That number is expected to increase as the company continues to add new users and show consistently higher revenue from monthly subscribers.

Over 175 million people across the country are under some form of cold weather alert as the mid-Atlantic and Northeast ready for another round of rain and snow and southern states brace for frigid temperatures and rare snowfall. The cold comes on the tail of another system that brought scattered rain and snow to parts of the East Coast on Saturday. Varying levels of cold weather alerts will be in effect across much of the country over the next couple of days as a ""bitterly cold Arctic airmass"" drops temperatures 10 to 40 degrees below average, according to the National Weather Service.

'Substantial snowfall' forecast in Houston

In Houston, where temperatures were plunging to freezing and below Sunday night, officials were contending with a separate low pressure-driven storm that was expected to produce rain, then freezing rain, then snow Monday into Tuesday, federal forecasters said. Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport was scheduled to close at 12 a.m. local time Tuesday, and the Houston Independent School District and other public schools in the region were also closing Tuesday in response to the weather. The National Weather Service said in a forecast discussion Sunday that ""snow totals would place this as one of the most substantial snowfall events in the history of the Greater Houston Area.""

Mayor John Whitmire said city crews were using deicing chemicals on roads, but he urged motorists to stay put during the storm. ""I've been convinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode,"" he said at a news conference Sunday. The storm was expected to make its way east along the Gulf Coast and southeast United States on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said in a forecast discussion. Rare snow was expected in Mobile, Alabama, and as far east as Pensacola, Florida, the weather service said, with accumulations on the ground and 1 to 4 inches possible starting Tuesday.

Mid-Atlantic and Northeast forecast

On Sunday afternoon, scattered snow and rain began pushing their way through the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Snowfall totals as of Sunday evening include 12 inches in Grantsville, Maryland, and 5.2 inches in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The snow was expected to come to an end late Sunday or early Monday as the system moves to the Northeast, affecting states along the Interstate 95 corridor. Snow totals of 2 to 6 inches are possible. Lingering snow showers will persist in New England early Monday, with most snow ending by sunrise. In Hartford, Connecticut, the weather service reported light snow falling Sunday night, with only trace amounts recorded so far. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul directed state agencies to prepare to respond to the storm, which could bring 4 to 6 inches of snow to New York City, 2 to 3 inches to Long Island and up to 10 inches to the mid-Hudson region. ""New Yorkers are no stranger to winter weather, but I encourage everyone to make sure you and your family are prepared for the snow and extreme cold, exercise caution if traveling and continue to monitor your local forecast,"" Hochul said in a statement. Earlier Sunday night a few inches of snow fell in New York City, with the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn reporting 3 inches. Also in New York, lake effect snow will develop downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie. Totals through Sunday night will range from 2 to 6 inches, with up to 8 inches possible in some areas. Light snow was reported in Buffalo and Albany late Sunday. Philadelphia city officials on Sunday night announced a ""snow emergency"" that prohibits parking on major routes and other streets designated for first responder use during the storm, according to a statement. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency, which went into effect Sunday morning. Murphy urged residents to follow safety protocols and stay off the roads, as about 8 to 12 inches of snow was expected in parts of the state. In Boston, around 4 to 8 inches of snow was expected to fall from Sunday afternoon into Monday morning.

While thunderstorms are expected in parts of Florida and the Southeast, the storm front was expected to make snow in the Mid-Atlantic, along the Appalachians and in the upper Ohio Valley on Sunday, as well as in the Northeast, where the storm would start Monday, federal forecasters said.

The National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida, warned of severe weather and heavy rain throughout the day and bitter cold starting Sunday night.

Describing the storm in its forecast discussion on Saturday as an ""intensifying cyclone,"" the weather service said 3 to 8 inches of snow was possible from West Virginia to the 95 corridor west of Interstate 95 in the urban Northeast and extending north to Downeast, Maine.

Life science stocks are under pressure due to possible NIH funding cuts. What lies ahead for the sector,"A recent move by the Trump administration to substantially lower funding from the National Institutes of Health for research institutions around the country has investors fearing meaningful losses for life science tools companies. The NIH announced in early February that it would cap research funding at 15% for ""indirect costs"" – those that aren't directly tied to specific research projects, such as overhead and administrative costs. The new cap is below the average indirect cost rate of between 27% and 28% and well under the rates of more than 60% that universities such as Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins receive. The agency has estimated that the proposed indirect funding cuts would amount to more than $4 billion in savings per year for the federal government. That's relative to the institutes' total budget for fiscal 2024 of more than $47 billion , which makes the NIH the world's largest single public funder of biomedical and behavioral research. However, the steep cuts from the Trump administration are already being challenged in court. Earlier this month, a federal judge blocked the White House from carrying out the reductions. Some lawmakers have spoken out against the cuts, including Republicans such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine – who said in a statement last month that it was ""poorly conceived."" As uncertainty hangs over the future of NIH-funded research, some on Wall Street are raising the alarm over stocks that could take a hit. ""Approximately 60% of U.S. academic research is funded by federal government agencies, and the NIH is the single largest source of A & G (Academic & Government) revenues for Tools companies,"" Bank of America analyst Michael Ryskin wrote in a Feb. 25 note. ""Regardless how it's resolved in the end, capping all indirect costs at 15% could significantly impact the ability of those institutions to provide the facilities and support for certain types of research, as individual scientists / grants are not going to be capable of supporting entire vivariums or complex infrastructure,"" the analyst continued. 'Bracing for weakness' In the aftermath of the NIH announcement, shares of many notable life science tools companies have lagged the broader market. While the S & P 500 has fallen 4% in the past month, Bruker slid more than 14%, and Illumina has dropped about 10.8%. Agilent and 10x Genomics declined more than 11% and 19%, respectively. Thermo Fisher Scientific has shed more than 3% in that time. Among those names, 10x Genomics, Illumina and Bruker have the highest A & G exposure in BofA's coverage. While direct NIH exposure is ""more limited,"" that could still be meaningful if funding is frozen, Ryskin wrote. That comes as the life science tools space was already coming under pressure over the past couple years. William Blair's Matt Larew told CNBC that this is largely because the space was coming off the Covid-19 pandemic, when clients made significant purchases in areas like equipment and consumables, overstocking many products because of supply chain concerns. ""Due to the weak macro in the last couple of years, growth in this space was really challenged, because customers had a lot of the product already,"" the analyst said. ""Finally, you'd gotten through that, and so the space for the first two weeks of the year actually outperformed the market for maybe the first time in a couple of years."" Those gains have now just completely disappeared, he pointed out. ILMN TXG,TMO,BRKR 5Y mountain ILMN, TGX, TMO and BRKR in past 5 years ""From an investor standpoint, I think people are very frustrated with what historically is viewed as a durable, noncyclical part of the market acting … more sensitive to these changing net market conditions,"" he continued. ""It's certainly a problem for the stocks. No question."" Larew also said that the current quarter and probably the next quarter are ""unquestionably"" going to look challenging for companies. Other analysts hold a similar view. ""People are bracing for weakness,"" TD Cowen analyst Daniel Brennan said in an interview with CNBC, adding that the market is preparing for impact particularly on companies' first-quarter earnings results over the next couple of months. ""People are trying to figure out: Is it priced in?"" Nevertheless, Brennan noted that any pressure on the stocks might offer a silver lining for those on the Street. ""If there is weakness, maybe it creates an opportunity for investors to step in,"" he continued. Longer-term turmoil? If the indirect costs cap is passed, institutions could collectively stand to lose billions of dollars in their research budgets. According to estimates from a calculator designed by Data for the Common Good at the University of Chicago, the total research budget loss would be more than $6.9 billion, based on fiscal 2024 figures. The D4CG also notes that the calculator is likely underestimating the amount of lost indirect costs, meaning the loss may actually be even greater. Tara LeGates, who has been a researcher in biological sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, since 2019, emphasized this will have a massive impact on the research projects she proposes. On top of that, she said the local economy is going to suffer as university staff could be laid off because those institutions won't have the means to support them. ""The indirects essentially are providing the infrastructure where I can do the project,"" she told CNBC. ""I can have a building with the lights on and electricity, and the students and the staff there to be able to actually accomplish those research goals. That evaporates."" Moving forward, LeGates believes that universities aren't going to have a reason to support research anymore with this policy change, anticipating that more hiring and admissions freezes for staff and students could ensue. Just a month ago, Stanford University, for instance, announced a staff hiring freeze , citing uncertainty around NIH cuts. ""We're going to see a huge stalling of scientific progress, because if universities are closing buildings because they can't operate them or they have fewer people to actually do the work, things just aren't going to get done,"" LeGates added. On that front, analyst Puneet Souda at Leerink said that the long-term impact of these cuts would threaten the U.S.' global position in scientific research, especially when it comes to drug discovery. ""We're talking fundamental, novel innovation, and that's what the American biomedical research system is able to do,"" he said to CNBC. ""It doesn't happen like this anywhere in the world, and that's what's at risk if these cuts are implemented.""",2025-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/life-science-stocks-are-under-pressure-due-to-possible-nih-funding-cuts.html,cnbc
To chase or not to chase? Trading this comeback rally using this energy stock as an example,"Buying strength works best when a stock is breaking out from a bullish chart pattern and is already in an established long-term uptrend. That uptrend can be as simple as a stock trading above a rising 200-day moving average. We've seen that combination work time and again over the last two years — positive momentum was rewarded, and prior resistance levels were cleared by dozens of stocks and ETFs. But buying strength in a stock that's spiking under a declining 200-DMA doesn't offer the same risk-reward profile. That's exactly the setup for Diamondback Energy (FANG) right now. FANG is currently working on its ninth straight daily gain and is tracking to be up in 13 of the last 14 sessions. And, yes, buying at any point along this run would have been profitable. But from here, we're a lot more interested in where the stock could be in two-to-three weeks, not just the next few days. One of the best things about using charts is that they help put things into perspective. And from that standpoint, FANG has had three similarly strong multi-week rallies since last June. Each time, the move lost steam after two-to-three weeks, with the stock failing to break through a well-defined downtrend line over the last number of months. FANG is now nearing that same trendline resistance once again. The consistent sell-off over the last nine months have caused the 200-DMA to rollover now, as well, and it's now in a downtrend, itself. So, does FANG slicing below its 200-day moving average guarantee a long, drawn-out bear market? Not necessarily. But history shows it can be a key warning sign, especially when that moving average is sloping lower. Looking back to 2013, there's one clear period where a sustained break below the 200-DMA led to real damage—2018. That marked the start of FANG's worst multi-year decline, which was ultimately exacerbated by crude oil going negative during COVID. While those circumstances were extreme, what mattered technically was this: FANG's continued failure beneath a declining 200-DMA kept it stuck in a bearish trend. There have been other instances where FANG dropped below the 200-DMA and didn't collapse(highlighted in yellow). But even then, a clean and immediate uptrend rarely followed. More often, the stock chopped around in a volatile range, and only started trending higher again once it cleared the 200-DMA — and just as importantly, once the moving average itself turned upward. So, what would suggest that this rally is different from the other failed attempts since last summer? Looking back at 2023 and early 2024, FANG went through two other volatile stretches. In both cases, the stock held up better than it has this time around. Still, in both instances, momentum didn't truly flip back to positive until FANG broke above a multi-month resistance zone. Once that happened, the worst was behind it, and the move eventually led to a very strong advance in the first half of 2024. The bottom line: we need to respect the strength of FANG's recent multi-week run — but also recognize that it's happening within a broader downtrend, beneath a major resistance zone, and under a declining 200-day moving average. At the very least, that suggests it's not worth chasing in the short term. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

"This used car play could benefit from higher tariffs, Stephens says","As investors brace for retaliatory tariffs set to take hold on April 2, Stephens says CarMax could buck the broader trend of market jitters and succeed even as the duties are implemented. ""We believe KMX will likely marginally benefit from most tariff scenarios, at least in year 1,"" Stephens analyst Jeff Lick wrote Tuesday. The investment bank upgraded CarMax to overweight from equal weight Wednesday, raising its 12-month price target to $90 a share from $86. Stephens' new valuation implies more than 21% upside from Tuesday's $74.26 close. KMX YTD mountain CarMax stock in 2025. The analyst said he is confident CarMax can hit its full-year targets, as well as estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Feb. 28, which are due out on April 10. ""Our analysis of both real-time unit sales and credit metrics give us comfort in our calendar 2025 estimates, especially 1H25,"" Lick said. ""We take comfort in KMX's operational consistency in both credit and used unit [gross profit per unit]."" Shares have ticked down about 7% in 2025, but are up about the same amount so far this week. Lick told CNBC it is likely the proposed tariffs will create a volatile environment for used car prices, benefiting CarMax as it takes advantage of wider spreads between the cost of goods sold and their actual selling prices. Additionally, Lick said CarMax shares can rally as investors look for alternative automotive exposure beyond original equipment manufacturers who will be hardest hit by tariffs. Stephens is not alone in seeing the Trump administration's tariffs as a potential catalyst for CarMax. Evercore ISI analyst Michael Montani in February said consumers are already trading down to used cars, as the value gap between new and used vehicles has widened. Tariffs on imports could heighten the trend, and ultimately benefit CarMax, given its focus on used cars, he wrote. Trump's tariffs on April 2 are aimed at any country that imposes duties on U.S. imports. The president has labeled the start date for the forthcoming tariffs as ""Liberation Day."" At the same time, Trump be signaling a softening in his stance. The president said on Tuesday that the tariffs will ""probably be more lenient than reciprocal.""

A stock market hedge if this comeback is a head fake and bigger losses are ahead,"Over the past few years, we've highlighted the risk of a slowdown in consumer spending as the post-pandemic surge — where consumers were flush with cash — has given way to depleted savings and rising debt levels to sustain spending. Recent data over the past four months shows a noticeable shift in consumer sentiment, with the Conference Board's recent measure of future expectations in March tumbling to a 12-year low , marking the first meaningful slowdown in consumer spending in years. Warning signals from major consumer names like Delta, Nike, and Walmart further highlight this growing risk. Additionally, the CBOE Volatility Index retreating below 18% and its 50-day moving average suggests investor complacency, potentially ignoring the risks of a pullback driven by this consumer slowdown. Despite a recent contraction of valuation multiples on the S & P 500, it remains elevated, indicating downside risks in a slowing economy. In this environment, the timing if more favorable to add bearish exposure with a long options position as a hedge to offset potential portfolio downside. The timing for the S & P 500 shows the index stalling at a significant resistance zone of 5,700-5,775 signaling heightened risks of a larger pullback with a downside target of 5,400. Additionally, with the VIX retreating below its 50 day average, the cost of buying portfolio protection is relatively inexpensive. A pullback to 5,400 aligns with historical support levels and reflects the potential impact of a consumer-driven slowdown on equity valuations. Fundamental analysis The S & P 500's current trades at 20.4 times forward earnings, while contracted recently, it remains 8% above the 10-year average of 18.8x, suggesting that valuations are still stretched. The decline in options implied volatility provides a favorable opportunity to purchase downside protection at a lower cost, especially as consumer sentiment deteriorates and spending slows. Bearish Thesis: Consumer Spending Slowdown: The Conference Board's future expectations index has fallen to a 12-year low over the past four months, signaling a meaningful slowdown in consumer spending as savings dwindle and debt levels rise. Investor Complacency: The VIX retreating below 18% and its 50-day SMA indicates that investors may be underpricing the probability of a larger pullback, particularly as consumer-driven companies like Delta, Nike, and Walmart issue warnings. Elevated Valuations: The S & P 500's forward PE of 20.4x, 8% above the 10-year average, leaves the market vulnerable to a correction, especially with economic growth slowing. Technical Resistance: The S & P 500 stalling at the 5,700-5,775 resistance level increases the likelihood of a pullback, with a downside target of 5,400. The trade To hedge against potential market downside, I'm buying the SPDR S & P 500 Trust (SPY) May 16, 2025 $575/545 Put Vertical @ $7.04 Debit This entails: Buying the May 16, 2025 $575 Put @ $11.44 Selling the May 16, 2025 $545 Put @ $4.40 View this Trade with Updated Prices at OptionsPlay The maximum reward is $2,296 if SPY is below $545 at expiration. The maximum risk is $704 if SPY is above $575 at expiration. The breakeven point for this trade is around $568 The Risk to Reward ratio of this is slightly better than 3 to 1 This strategy positions you to hedge against a potential market pullback, leveraging the S & P 500's technical resistance and cheap options premiums amidst a slowing consumer economy. By using SPY as a hedge, this put vertical offers a way to offset portfolio downside with defined risk, providing protection as the market risks a decline to 5,400.

"Rosenblatt says buy the dip in Coinbase, citing growth of USDC stablecoin","Investors may be overlooking a key component of Coinbase's business that is offsetting recent weakness in the company's core trading business, according to Rosenblatt. Trading volumes have fallen amid cautious market conditions. March's daily average is now 20% below February's after being up 10% just two weeks ago. However, stablecoin growth has accelerated, driven mainly by USDC , the second-largest stablecoin on the market, with which Coinbase enjoys a 50% revenue-sharing agreement . ""We're not worried as the potential top line pressure is offset by encouraging market share gains and accelerating outstanding growth at USDC, up 36% YTD,"" Chris Brendler, the analyst at Rosenblatt, said of the crypto exchange operator in a note Wednesday. ""With stablecoin legislation increasingly likely in 3Q25, we believe investors underestimate the potential of COIN's non-trading revenue streams in this political environment and expect the stock to revalue higher as investors grow more comfortable with COIN's business mix."" COIN YTD mountain Coinbase (COIN) YTD ""As a result, we view any volume-related weakness in the shares as a buying opportunity and reiterate our BUY rating,"" he said. Brendler has a $305 price target on the shares, implying almost 50% upside from its closing price Tuesday. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that promise a fixed value peg to another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. The market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins has been climbing to all-time highs this year and has grown more than 46% over the past 12 months, according to CryptoQuant. USDC makes up about 26% of the total market cap for stablecoins, behind Tether 's 67% dominance. Its market cap has grown 36% this year, however, compared with Tether's 5% growth. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a ""stretch goal to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin."" Coinbase is up 1% since President Donald Trump was reelected in November, but is down 9% in March and 21% year to date. ""With multiple positive tailwinds from the sea change in attitudes toward crypto in DC, we believe continued weakness as unlikely, so our estimates remain unchanged for now,"" Brendler said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

43-year-old abroad pays $650 a month in rent and never plans to return to the U.S.: It's been 'great',"This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which details how people around the world earn, spend and save their money. In 2008, during what would come to be known as the Great Recession, stories like Nicole Brewer's were all too common. At 27, she'd recently bought a condo on the South Side of Chicago with little money down and a loan that would likely stretch her mid-$30,000's salary thin. Then the market research firm she worked for did layoffs, and she lost her job. Amid a financial crisis, finding another one proved difficult. After collecting unemployment benefits for five of the allotted six months, Brewer, like many of her peers, was growing desperate. ""I remember I got scared and I was like, 'OK, what are you going to do if your unemployment runs out? You don't have a job,'"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""That's when I started looking at opportunities. I said, 'I'll think outside the box, look at some teaching jobs abroad.'"" Brewer found a gig teaching English at a primary school South Korea, a move that would satisfy some wanderlust while she waited for the U.S. economy to bounce back.

But that's where her story gets a little less common. After three years in Korea, Brewer took a college-level ESL job, this time in Nizwa, an ancient city in Oman about a 90-minute drive from Muscat, the nation's capital. She's been there ever since, living happily and traveling — and currently earning a salary of just over $40,000 a year, plus some side-hustle income. ""I have had such an incredible experience living here. I never even imagined that I would be here for 10-plus years, because I just felt comfortable here,"" Brewer, 43, says. ""My mental health has definitely been great here.""

Moving abroad

A move abroad can be daunting — especially for someone in a precarious financial situation. But for Brewer, who'd moved to a new country with just two suitcases, things were surprisingly seamless. ""Fortunately at that time, being recruited to work for the education department in Korea, they helped set you up,"" she says. That meant covering the cost of her flight and assigning her a liaison from her school who helped her find an apartment and transition into working life in Busan, a city of just over 3 million people.

Back home, things were still rough. The renter she'd found to take over payments on her Chicago condo lost his job too and soon fell behind. The bank foreclosed on the property. That may have made life difficult for Brewer had she chosen to return to the States on her original timeline. But it didn't take long for her to realize that expat life suited her. Her home base in Korea, along with a modest cost of living, allowed her to see parts of the world she would have likely otherwise missed, including trips to India and the Philippines. ""I was able to live comfortably and still travel a bit,"" she says.

Life in Oman

After three years, Brewer was looking for a change of pace, and initially thought she might like Dubai. While researching the region, she came across a posting for a job at a university in Oman. ""After seeing that posting, I ended up researching on my own and I was like, 'Wow, this is a very beautiful country,'"" Brewer says. She gave it a chance, boarding a plane in 2012, once again with two suitcases and plans to figure things out when she got there. Other than brief stints in Germany and South Africa to complete an accelerated masters program in international humanitarian aid, she's stuck around. Brewer's main gig is still teaching English, a job which pays her about $3,400 a month, even when school is not in session. Over the years, she's picked up some side hustles, too, as a freelance travel writer and part-time travel advisor. Those brought her an extra $3,400 in 2024.

Brewer's modest cost of living allows her to save up for her true passion, traveling. Kedar Sonigra for CNBC Make It

Brewer is still an American citizen and pays income taxes in the U.S. And even though she doesn't necessarily blend in with the locals — she doesn't speak Arabic or practice Islam — her Yankee status comes with a certain level of respect. ""I like to call it 'passport privilege,'"" she says. Overall, she says, being a Black American woman doesn't come with many of the burdens while living abroad as it might have back home. ""I wouldn't say that I deal with much or any racism, because I think it's more so, you're American — we take pride in having an American who loves living in Oman."" Even though it took a while for Brewer to adjust to the conservative Omani lifestyle — and casual dating is still a struggle — she says she consistently feels welcomed by the Omani people. ""They welcome me. They say, 'Oh, hello, sister,' when I get in taxis. They call me sister like I'm one of them because I respect the culture,"" she says. ""It's been very great. I wouldn't have stayed as long as I had if it wasn't a good life here.""

How Brewer spends her money

Despite the region's reputation for opulence, Brewer's day-to-day life in Oman is unostentatious and, by U.S. standards, inexpensive. Here's how she spent her money in January 2025.

She spends about $70 or $80 a week on groceries. Insurance, a major line item in most American workers' budgets, is covered by her employer. Living relatively modestly for most of the year allows Brewer to devote significant funds toward her life's passion: travel. More than half her January spending went toward a trip to Bali during her school's winter break. She generally takes two or three big trips a year, and her location in the Middle East makes it easier to travel to some parts of the world than if she had stayed in the U.S. Trips to Namibia and the Seychelles, she says, are much more affordable with Oman has a home base. ""I'm able to travel to Europe, of course, as well, because it's right there,"" she says.

'I'm grateful for every trip that I have been on'

Even given her relatively low cost of living, traveling the world on a teacher's salary means Brewer has had to put some financial goals on the back burner. Although her credit cards are paid off, she still carries about $24,600 in student debt from her time as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. And while she has about $22,000 invested across stocks and cryptocurrency, it's hardly enough for her to feel like she's on track for major financial milestones, like retirement.

"I've coached kids who got into Harvard, Stanford and Princeton—4 things their parents did early on","For close to a decade, I've worked with hundreds of students and their parents as an extracurricular coach at Spike Lab. I've seen my students win major awards, raise venture capital, build businesses and launch impressive projects that helped them stand out in a college admissions process that prizes exceptionalism — both in and out of the classroom. They've gotten accepted into Ivy Leagues, including Stanford, Harvard and Princeton. While working with these students, I've learned a lot about their family relationships. Here are four things I've noticed that their parents do early on.

1. They don't ""snowplow"" for their kids

Snowplow parenting is when parents clear a path to make things easier for their kids. This could be something as small as coordinating logistics with me via email on their kid's behalf (sometimes pretending to be them), to something as big as writing their kid's college essay for them. DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money This well-intentioned but misguided trap prevents kids from developing agency. It teaches them that if they don't do something, someone else will do it for them. The most successful kids learn to take ownership, especially when it's difficult. Instead of snowplowing, be a sounding board and guide that your kid can turn to for help only when necessary. Let your child face the natural consequences that come from their inaction. They will learn not to make the same mistake again.

2. They respect their kids' interests

I've seen kids with a wide range of niche interests. I've watched them create incredible projects that deepen their hobbies in impactful ways, whether it's building elementary school math curriculum grounded in baseball statistics or starting a knitting circle for jocks. While many parents try to push their children in more serious directions, it's better to let their interests lead the process. You never know what kind of success can come from supporting those passions and helping them flourish. But not every hobby has to become a passion. And parents should never lead students toward activities just because they think it will look good on college applications.

3. They cultivate independence from a young age

Soccer practice. Singing lessons. Art class. Piano. It's not uncommon now for elementary schoolers to have schedules as packed as high school seniors. The result is that children today are busier than ever, often with activities that deprive them of valuable unstructured time. Research has found that the more time kids spend in less structured activities, the more they will develop independence. Though structure has its place, allowing your kids to be bored and to take ownership of their time from an early age is one of the best ways to foster independence and creativity. One of my most emotionally mature students walked to school from an early age, which studies have shown has a range of developmental benefits. Even daily quotidian choices like what to wear and what to eat can flex decision-making muscles.

4. They model positive behaviors",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/ive-coached-kids-who-got-into-harvard-stanford-princeton-heres-what-their-parents-did-early-on.html,cnbc
"Snapchat CEO: I give my employees an ‘almost impossible’ task on their first day—that way, they’ve ‘already failed’ early","Sometimes, your first day of a new job sets the tone for the rest of your tenure.

That's why Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel gives new employees on his design team a very difficult task on their first day, he said on Monday's podcast episode of ""The Diary of a CEO.""

""We have design critiques once a week for a couple hours,"" said Spiegel, 34, whose company owns social media app Snapchat. ""[On] your very first day, you have to present something ... Of course, on your first day, when you have no context for what the company is working on ... How on Earth are you supposed to come up with a good idea? I mean, it's almost impossible.""

The tactic may seem unfair, but it lays the groundwork for the creativity and critical thinking skills that the employee will need to succeed at the company, Spiegel said. It can also help people quickly get over their fear of failure, encouraging them to take more work-related risks.

""Your worst fear has come true that we're sitting there all together and we're looking at an idea that's not that great. I mean, sometimes they're pretty good, but ultimately not that great,"" he said. ""And I think that opens the door to creativity because it already happened. You already failed.""

The exercise helps people build confidence and mental resilience, and acts as a bit of a bonding activity for employees, said Spiegel.

Overcoming a fear of failure — or any other fear, for that matter — can be predictably challenging. Effective strategies can sound silly, like attaching a funny accent to the voice inside your head or giving yourself a hug, but they're likely to work if they can ""disrupt"" the pattern inside your brain, phobia specialist Christopher Paul James told CNBC Make It on July 1.

Facing your fears head-on can work too, according to leadership consultant and retired Navy SEAL officer Jocko Willink.

""The first thing you've got to realize is that most of the fear that you have isn't a reality. It's just built up in your head,"" Willink said in February 2019. ""So what you need to do to overcome your fear is to go and face it. Go and look at it. Go on the attack.""",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/snapchat-ceo-why-i-give-employees-nearly-impossible-task-first-day.html,cnbc
"'Captain America' star Anthony Mackie: 'We're lying to our kids' when we say success comes just from hard work—luck is key, too","A lot of parents tell their children that can achieve anything if they work hard and apply themselves. But that doesn't account for luck, which is a huge factor that many highly successful people have said they owe their careers to, points out Anthony Mackie, star of the 2025 movie ""Captain America: Brave New World.""

""We are lying to our kids,"" Mackie, 46, said in a recent interview with The Pivot Podcast. ""We tell [them] … if they do right and they make the good grades and they go to the programs, they will become successful. 'If you work hard enough, your work will [pay off].' And that's not true.""

In many cases, ""success is given [and] not earned,"" Mackie continued.

Mackie had been an actor for over 10 years before landing the role that many consider his big break, as Sam Wilson in 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" he said. After graduating from the prestigious Juilliard School in 2001, he performed in both on- and Off-Broadway productions and in Academy award-winning films, like 2008's ""The Hurt Locker."" However, the New Orleans native struggled to break out in Hollywood's highly competitive landscape.

Mackie estimates he ""put in 10,750 hours of training"" before landing that life-changing job. He was proactive, too: He wrote letters to executives at Disney's Marvel Studios over a decade ago in the hopes of landing a role in one of the studio's popular superhero films, he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2023.

While the letters didn't result in any roles right away, Mackie eventually landed a meeting with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. They offered him a part in an upcoming film, though they couldn't share many details: ""[They said], 'We can't say what character you're playing or who else is going to be in it. Would you do it?'"" Mackie said.

The actor agreed because he liked the directors and believed joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe was an opportunity he couldn't pass up, he said. Fortunately for Mackie, the role of Sam Wilson proved popular enough to grow from a small character into a headliner.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/captain-america-anthony-mackie-success-is-given-not-earned.html,cnbc
"You can earn $150,000 a year and still be considered middle class in 23 U.S. states","In the 1990s, earning six figures was a clear marker of upper-class wealth. Today, it's often just enough to be considered middle class.

In fact, the upper bound of what qualifies as middle class now exceeds $100,000 in every U.S. state, according to a SmartAsset analysis of 2023 income data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The report uses Pew Research's definition of middle class: households earning between two-thirds and double the median income in their state.

Student loan borrowers can once again apply for income-driven repayment plans—these 3 options are available,"The Department of Education announced Wednesday it is reopening applications for income-driven repayment plans for federal student loan borrowers.

IDR plans allow borrowers to make monthly payments based on their income, aiming to give low-income borrowers an affordable repayment option to help them stay current on their loans.

On Feb. 26, President Donald Trump's administration removed the online application from the Federal Student Aid website and reportedly instructed loan servicers to pause the processing of new IDR applications, according to The Washington Post, in response to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals' Feb. 18 injunction preventing President Joe Biden's Saving on a Valuable Education IDR plan from rolling out. The Feb. 18 injunction continued a stay on the SAVE plan the 8th Circuit court issued in July 2024.

On March 19, the American Federation of Teachers sued the Trump administration over the IDR application shutdown, claiming the administration misinterpreted the 8th Circuit ruling and illegally blocked borrowers from accessing more affordable monthly payments and making progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

AFT and the Student Borrower Protection Center, which is representing the union in its lawsuit, take credit in pressuring the Trump administration to restore IDR applications.

However, the Trump administration maintains it only removed IDR applications to ensure compliance with the 8th Circuit ruling and revisions have now been made ""to conform with the ruling,"" James Bergeron, acting Under Secretary of Education, said in ED's announcement on Wednesday.

""Because the online application incorporated provisions subject to the injunction, it was necessary to revise the form, making it unavailable to borrowers in the interim,"" ED said in its press release. ""Paper loan consolidation applications were available to borrowers during that time.""

Now, borrowers can once again apply for one of three repayment plans: income-based repayment, Pay As You Earn and income-contingent repayment. Log in to the Federal Student Aid website or visit your loan servicer's website to apply for any of the IDR plans available to you.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/student-loan-borrowers-can-apply-for-income-driven-repayment-again.html,cnbc
"This may be 'the best advice I have ever received,' says CFP—and it can help you during March Madness","March Madness resumes on Thursday. And many sports fans will resume wagering legally on the games.

Gamblers will bet $3.1 billion through legal means on the NCAA men's basketball tournament this year, according to an estimate from the American Gaming Association.

By now, you may have seen the memes suggesting that a surprising number of guys you know may bet more than they can afford.

Some data backs up these assumptions. In a 2023 survey from Men's Health, for instance, about 40% of men said they'd placed a sports bet in the last year. Of those, 1 in 5 admitted they'd racked up debt because of gambling.

You may start by betting an amount you think you can afford to lose. Then, after an unlucky streak, you can be tempted to up your bets to get back to even.

This phenomenon, known as ""chasing"" your losses, is ""a perfect recipe for addiction,"" Jonathan Greeson, a certified financial planner based in Pikeville, North Carolina, recently told CNBC Make It.

Keeping yourself from betting more than you can afford is partly a question of mindset, says Greeson. If watching sports has gone from an enjoyable pastime to something stressful that you feel you need to make money on, it's time to reconsider the way you gamble.

""As a child, I saw an old fisherman lying in the grass beside a pond and I asked why he wasn't fishing. He said, 'Son, when the things you enjoy start feeling like work, stop,'"" Greeson says. ""That might be the best advice I have ever received.""",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/march-madness-sports-betting-best-advice-from-cfp.html,cnbc
39-year-old American who pays $0 on rent in Paris is 'always out exploring': Here's how much he spends per month,"The short answer to how Jay Swanson lives in Paris, France, while paying $0 for rent is that he got lucky.

The 39-year-old Washington State native spent time volunteering with a nongovernmental organization from 2010 to 2014, and made friends with a doctor while working in West Africa.

In 2012, Swanson went to Paris to serve in a different role with the organization and shared on his blog that he was struggling to find a place to live. The doctor he'd met while volunteering saw the post and connected Swanson with their mother-in-law, who owned an apartment in Paris. She offered Swanson the apartment's former maid's chambers — rent-free.

""She found out that I was struggling to find a place, took pity on me, let me have this [space] temporarily, and that temporary stay has now lasted for about 13 years,"" Swanson tells CNBC Make It.

The apartment's owner lives in New York, but after having Swanson staying in her Paris home, she realized she liked having someone there, he says, so she welcomed him to stay as long as he liked. Swanson's quarters are small and he has to use a shared bathroom down the hall, but it fits his needs well.

"‘Be loyal’ to your job is the worst career advice I've received, says leadership expert: 'That's what I get from my relationship'","In 2022, Kalifa Oliver was riding high. She'd just been promoted to a vice president-level position at her company and had held a Zoom call with family members to celebrate the good news.

Four months later, she was laid off.

Up until her abrupt, unexpected termination, she was a self-proclaimed ""career girl,"" she says. Work was her life. It was a huge source of her happiness and validation.

Losing her job helped change her mindset, says Oliver, 41, an author, executive advisor and now the global director for employee experience at Ford who lives in South Carolina. She got her Ph.D. in organizational psychology from Clemson University in 2012.

In fact, the worst professional advice she's ever received, she realizes now, is that ""work should be my whole life and I should be loyal.""

Loyalty ""is what I get from my marriage,"" she says. ""It's what I get from my relationships."" It's not what she should unquestioningly offer up to, or expect from, her employer.

Losing her job thrust Oliver into a crisis she didn't see coming. ""I couldn't get out of bed. I had to go on a whole retreat, and then I had to realize [I] had an identity that was work, and somebody took the identity away,"" she says. ""I met with my therapist, and she said, 'Who are you without a job?' And I couldn't answer her.""

Today, Oliver recognizes that she's more than a title: She's a mom, a friend, a daughter, and a bit of a comedian in her own right. Though she's proud to be in her current role as an executive, Oliver doesn't let the job define her, and she doesn't put the company over her own happiness and well-being.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/be-loyal-is-the-worst-career-advice-i-ever-got-says-leadership-expert.html,cnbc
Hinge CEO: The tactic I use the most to sharpen my mental resilience—it ‘instantly’ makes me think positively,"Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod credits his productivity at least partially, to his easy-going wellness routine.

McLeod founded the dating app in 2011, sold it to Tinder-owner Match Group in 2019 for an undisclosed fee and stayed on as CEO, growing Hinge into one of America's most-used online dating venues. The 38-year-old says there's one mental exercise he does everyday that helps him perform at his best.

""If there's one life hack I think that I use the most, it's probably a gratitude list,"" McLeod said on a recent episode of LinkedIn's ""This is Working"" podcast.

"32-year-old brings in an average $13,000 a month as a music engineer—without a college degree: Here’s how","Beau Vallis always knew he wanted to pursue music.

The 32-year-old grew up in Norwood, New Jersey, the son of a wedding band drummer and a professional dancer. Around the time of his high school graduation in 2010, Vallis landed an internship at the Miami studio of producer and engineer Jimmy Douglass, who had worked with such icons as Aretha Franklin and Missy Elliott. Vallis ended up engineering former Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland's music soon after starting his internship and became her go-to engineer going forward.

Vallis ultimately moved to LA and from 2011 to 2016 worked with Rowland and other artists like Future and Alessia Cara. He also worked on Pharrell Williams' album ""Girl,"" which got nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy in 2015.

It was a dream career with one huge problem: ""It wasn't sustainable,"" he says,

Vallis would charge around $500 to $750 per day, he says, invoicing the artists' labels for his pay. But regardless of project, ""the label kind of chooses what they want to pay when they want to pay it,"" he says. He ""never"" knew when or even if he was getting paid, he says.

Vallis and his now-wife moved back to Miami in 2016 as a way to save money. After hearing about Fiverr from a fellow engineer, Vallis started trying to make some extra income on the site, ultimately carving out a niche for himself as a music engineer. He's been working full time on Fiverr since 2017.

"These 'red flag' phrases in a job interview could signal a challenging workplace, says Gen Z career expert","In today's job market, it can feel like winning the lottery just to hear back from a recruiter to set up an interview.

But even in a challenging market, it's important to know what you need in a job, what you want and what your red flags are.

Gen Z career expert Jade Walters recommends looking out for one major red flag that could keep you from burning out in the future: Avoid joining a team that's clearly short-staffed and desperate to hire.

To gauge this, Walters, founder of the Ninth Semester, tells CNBC Make It she always asks the recruiter or hiring manager how many people are on the team she'd be joining, how they work together, and how the role will support the overall team's goals.

It's a red flag if the interviewer describes the team as ""very lean"" or ""very small,"" Walters says.

She speaks from experience: ""I've been in situations where it was a team of two, and you're doing the work of three people.""

Walters says an understaffed team could also signal that other people are trying to quit, she adds. She recalls once being hired to a job only for a colleague to leave soon after she joined, leaving her with double the work as a new hire.

As such, Walters recommends gauging the team's workload as soon as possible and reflecting whether that's an environment you'd thrive in.

Of course, many job-seekers need a job urgently to pay their bills. But for those with a little more flexibility, it can help to ""think in the future,"" Walters says, ""and not, for lack of a better word, desperation.""

"Neurologists and neuroscientists share their 5 best practices for keeping your brain healthy and sharp: 'Avoid boredom, stay challenged'","Here are five practices that stand out as effective.

To quell this issue, we've spoken to neuroscientists and neurologists, sifted through research and watched TED talks to compile the best advice for achieving optimal brain health.

Yet, two-thirds report having little to no knowledge about brain health research and what actually works to keep the vital organ healthy, the survey shows.

Americans place brain health and mental health high up on their list of the most important health issues, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adults conducted in 2022 by Dana Foundation , Research!America and Zogby Analytics.

Most people want to keep their brain sharp, especially as they age, to ward off conditions like dementia and depression.

1. Get your steps in

The simplest way that you can start to improve your brain health is by walking often, according to Dr. Wendy Suzuki, a neuroscientist and professor at NYU.

""Just 10 minutes of walking, that everybody anywhere could do, decreases your anxiety and depression levels,"" Suzuki said during TED Intersections.

Getting your steps in daily can produce neurochemicals in your brain like dopamine and serotonin, but it can also increase growth factors that may make the organ healthier, she said. The key is consistency for weeks, months and years to really see these benefits, she noted.

Even if you were ""couch potato until you're 75,"" starting daily walks today could improve your brain health, Suzuki said.

2. 'Avoid boredom, stay challenged'

When I spoke to Dr. Richard Restak in 2024, he was 82 years old working on another book to add to his collection of over 20 books he's written.

""I try to avoid boredom. I try to [stay] active,"" Restak said. ""I learn new words, practice memory exercises, and [I] make them fun.""

This lends to his advice for anyone who wants to keep their memory sharp: ""Avoid boredom, stay challenged.""

Suzuki's ""401(k) for your brain,"" which she shared during a MasterClass about improving brain health, also includes trying new and challenging things. She and Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist and neuroscientist, shared a list of activities that engage the brain:

Learning a new language

Meeting people for the first time

Reading new books

Playing fun memory games

Traveling to places you haven't been before

""Challenges that are hard enough that they might be slightly unpleasant,"" Barrett said during the class.

3. Connect with others

Having quality social connections in your life is extremely beneficial for your brain, Suzuki said during the MasterClass series. Maintaining your relationships can also greatly benefit your overall health and lead to longevity.

""Laughing and pleasurable social interactions decrease your stress levels,"" she said.

Eating a healthy meal and taking a walk can be great for your brain health on their own, but those actions can have even greater benefits on your brain if you do them with other people.

4. Practice emotional intelligence

Being in control of your feelings, and not the other way around, is vital for your brain, Suzuki and Barrett said. This is called emotional intelligence, a practice that involves training your brain to be more flexible when it comes to emotions.

""Whether you deal with distress as sadness or anger is very different than if you make sense of that distress as you've had a really tough week and you just need a little bit of self care,"" Barrett said.

Suzuki suggested practicing what she calls ""joy conditioning"" to feel more positive emotions. To practice it, you should think about positive memories from the past and attempt to reenact the emotions you felt during the time.

5. Consider these questions

There are tests that you can take to estimate the health of your brain. One test is the Brain Care Score, which was created by a group of researchers including Dr. Jonathan Rosand, a professor of neurology at Harvard University who treats patients with head trauma and strokes at Massachusetts General Hospital.

To get your Brain Care Score, you answer questions, via a quiz, about your social relationships, dietary habits and more. The higher the score, the healthier your brain.

Here are a few of the questions you can expect:

Are your stress levels manageable, or do you have difficulty functioning because of stress?

Do you smoke?

What is your resting blood pressure?

Do you sleep for less than 7 hours a night or have untreated sleep disorders?

Higher Brain Care Scores have been associated with a lower risk of depression, stroke and dementia, according to a study published in Frontiers in Psychiatry.

If your score is low, you can improve it by focusing on one of the areas that needs work, Rosand said.

Investors were reacting to the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures price index — the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure — which rose more than expected on Friday, according to an update released Friday. It put the core annual inflation rate at a hotter-than-expected 2.8%.

European shares deepened their losses following the data release, while U.S. stocks tumbled in morning deals on Wall Street.

U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariffs on foreign automakers are also still weighing on sentiment. On Wednesday, the president announced 25% duties on all cars ""not made in the United States,"" with the levies set to go into effect from April 2.

He later threatened to impose ""far larger"" tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they worked together to combat duties from the U.S.

Ubisoft shares reversed course on Friday in a volatile trading day for the firm, following news that it's carving out some of its best-selling game franchises. The French video game publisher on Thursday revealed plans to form a new gaming subsidiary, with Chinese technology giant Tencent investing 1.16 billion euros ($1.25 billion) into the unit. The subsidiary will include Ubisoft's best-known games brands, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, according to a press release. Ubisoft shares initially jumped as much as 11% Friday morning. However, in afternoon deals the stock declined and was last trading down nearly 2%. The game maker said Thursday that its newly formed unit would ""focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform.""

The investment from Tencent values the new subsidiary at 4 billion euros, Ubisoft said. That's more than double Ubisoft's current market capitalization. Investors were hoping for a move from Ubisoft to clear up uncertainty surrounding its future after a series of challenges faced by the firm in recent years. Ubisoft has been plagued by various issues, from financial struggles to delays to some of its key games — including its most recently released Assassin's Creed Shadows title. In February, the firm reported a 52% drop in fiscal third-quarter net bookings, beset by underperformance of some of its key games. The structure of the Tencent-backed spinoff is ""innovative and aims to highlight the value of Ubisoft's top franchises, while also not ceding overall control to Tencent on paper,"" Piers Harding-Rolls, research director of games at Ampere Analysis, told CNBC via email. ""However, to get the most from these franchises, I expect Tencent to have a stronger influence in cross-platform expansion especially in areas where it has deep expertise such as mobile and PC gaming and to hold more influence generally,"" he added.

Novo Nordisk defends disappointing next-gen obesity drug: 'It will be an important product',"A view of the logo of Novo Nordisk at the company's office in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, March 8, 2024. Tom Little | Reuters

Copenhagen, DENMARK — Novo Nordisk defended disappointing trial results for its much-hyped next generation obesity drug candidate CagriSema, insisting it will be an ""important"" weight loss treatment. CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen on Thursday acknowledged the sharp share price reaction after two consecutive late-stage trials showed underwhelming weight reduction versus the company's own targets, but said he nevertheless remained ""encouraged"" by the drug's weight loss profile. ""I'm very confident about CagriSema,"" he told shareholders at the firm's Annual General Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""It will be an important product for us.""

CagriSema is a combination of cagrilintide — a nascent form of weight loss treatment known as an amylin analog — and semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy. Headline results from a REDEFINE-2 late-stage trial released earlier this month showed that CagriSema helped obese or overweight adult patients with type 2 diabetes lose 15.7% of their weight over 68 weeks, compared with 3.1% with placebo. This was below the high-teens percentage of weigh loss previously forecast. A prior late-stage trial published in December showed the drug helped obese or overweight patients with one or more comorbidities, but not type-2 diabetes, lower their weight by 22.7% after 68 weeks, also below the 25% expected. Both results wiped significant value from Novo's share price as investors' hopes of finding a superior alternative to the company's existing Wegovy injection and rival Eli Lily's Zepbound, both GLP-1 medications, were dashed. The once darling stock is now down more than 50% from its 2024 highs.

Activist investor Elliott takes short position in Shell after building a stake in rival BP,"U.S. activist investor Elliott Investment Management has taken a short position against British oil major Shell as part of a global hedging program.

The move, which was first reported by British newspaper The Times on Thursday, comes shortly after it emerged Paul Singer's hedge fund had taken a near 5% stake in Shell's struggling rival, BP.

Elliott is said to have amassed an £850 million ($1.1 billion) bet against Shell, The Times reported, citing filings with the Financial Conduct Authority.

The position is reportedly worth 0.5% of Shell's stock and is thought to represent the biggest short position disclosed against the energy major in nearly a decade. A short position refers to a bet that a company's stock will fall in value.

"Binance's Richard Teng and HashKey's CEO Chao Deng on the future of crypto, regulation and adoption","Crypto markets have been volatile since U.S. President Trump was elected in November 2024. His pro-crypto promises prompted bitcoin to record highs, but his recent ""America First"" policies have rattled markets, including crypto.

At CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore, Arjun Kharpal spoke with Binance's CEO Richard Teng and HashKey Capital's CEO Chao Deng about the future of the crypto industry.

""The more people learn about crypto as a journey, the more they understand all the important utility and use cases,"" Teng told CNBC at CONVERGE LIVE.

""Crypto is instantaneous, you receive your funds at a fraction of the cost of what traditional financial institution charge. Same for payments, fees, etcetera. So, there are so many important use cases,"" he added.

The conversation took place just a few weeks after President Trump announced the creation of a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.""

""The messaging is the largest government, the largest economy, the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of a reserve. It will cause many other governments to think through the issue,"" Teng said.

Regarding crypto adoption, HashKey's Chao Deng talked about the recent changes made by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that allow U.S. banks to hold crypto.

""This is a very huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry. Before that, the banks were very conservative about serving the crypto space, but after this, they feel more comfortable to deal with crypto-related clients,"" Deng said.

Another topic on the agenda was China's re-adoption of crypto.

""When it comes to crypto, the Chinese leaders have always stopped across in the river by filling the stones. They have to do it step by step. Hong Kong is always like the window. It's the research lab,"" Deng told CNBC.

""If everything goes well, if mainland China see they progress in mass adoption, there is a likelihood,"" he added.

China was once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency markets, but the country gradually disallowed crypto operations, achieving an absolute ban in 2021.

Your credit card likely has benefits you don't know about — here's how to find them,"Elite status at hotel and car rental companies can bring a host of benefits, from complimentary breakfast to upgraded vehicles. But achieving these lofty tiers are a stretch for the average traveler. Or are they? Upgraded loyalty status and other travel benefits come with some credit cards, and many of these perks are touted by the banks that issue them. But some benefits are less advertised. You can find them by going directly to the credit card company itself.

Find your card

In this report, we are accessing benefits from two credit card companies: Mastercard and Visa. If you have a credit card from either company, take a look at the card to see if you own one of these: Mastercard: Standard or Gold Mastercard, Mastercard Platinum or Titanium, Mastercard World, Mastercard World Elite Visa: Visa Classic, Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Infinite Card benefits and conditions differ by country, but here are some that CNBC Travel found that are available in Asia-Pacific.

Entry-level perks

For those who think that decent perks only come with top tier cards, fear not. Credit card companies grant benefits to entry-level card holders too. Holders of a Standard Mastercard are entitled to a complimentary extra night at Capella Hotels and Resorts (with certain restrictions and at selected properties) and automatic ""Gold"" status in Wyndham Hotels & Resorts loyalty program, which comes with accelerated points earnings and late check-outs.

Holders of Visa Classic cards can get 20% off participating restaurants under its ""Dine and Save"" program, but this and other discounts with airlines and travel booking portals, are often well publicized.

Top-tier perks

Holders of Mastercard World Elite cards may not know that they quality for ""Titanium"" status at GHA Discovery, the highest tier of the Global Hotel Alliance's hotel loyalty program. The alliance includes 45 hotel brands, including Capella, Parkroyal, and Pan Pacific hotels and resorts. Meanwhile, Mastercard World cardholders can get ""Platinum"" status at GHA Discovery, the second highest tier. Normally, qualifying for Titanium status requires a traveler to stay 30 nights, or spend $15,000 or stay at three different brands in a calendar year. This level grants members a ""double upgrade"" on rooms, free breakfast and up to 7% in ""rewards currency"" that can applied to future stays. Similarly, Visa Signature and Visa Infinite cardholders can book hotels in the Visa Luxury Hotel Collection, which come with $25 dining credit, late checkouts and automatic room upgrades, when available, at more than 900 luxury hotels around the world. Brands in the collection include Mandarin Oriental, Park Hyatt, Shangri-La and Six Senses hotels.

Is there a catch?

It depends. CNBC found that the terms and conditions tied to some offers can be restrictive. For example, some offers need to be booked via a specific landing page, or are subject to blackout dates. Some ""complimentary"" offers require a paying customer, before the ""free"" benefits are handed out. For elite status programs, memberships lapse after specific periods; thereafter, cardholders must requalify via normal routes. For example, enrollment in the GHA Discovery program starts the year you enroll, and then lasts one more calendar year.

Awareness

Having these benefits is great, but if issuing banks aren't pushing them, are they being used? When asked, Mastercard told CNBC that a ""fair percentage of cardholders are aware of the card benefits, find them relevant and enjoy using them."" The credit card network also said its top-tier World Elite cardholders, who tend to be affluent, are more likely to use the benefits than other cardholders.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/how-to-save-money-on-travel-with-lesser-known-credit-card-perks-.html,cnbc
"Trump's tariffs push will hit the U.S. harder than Europe in the short term, Santander chair says","watch now

The White House's protectionist policies could hit the U.S. harder than Europe in the short term, Banco Santander 's executive chair told CNBC on Thursday, as tariffs take a toll on domestic consumers. ""Tariffs [are] a tax. It's a tax on the consumer."" Ana Botín said in an interview with CNBC's Karen Tso in Brussels on the sidelines of the 2025 IIF European Summit. ""Ultimately, the economy will pay a price. There will be less growth and there will be more inflation, other things equal."" President Donald Trump has imposed — and at times suspended or revoked — a slew of tariffs on imports into the U.S. since his second administration began in January. He is seeking to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce trade deficits between the world's largest economy and its commercial partners. Botín is not alone in her warning regarding tariffs' negative impact on the U.S., with many analysts also saying the duties could ultimately cause higher inflation and strain the wallets of U.S. consumers. ""On a relative basis, in the short term, Europe will be less affected than the U.S.,"" Botín said Thursday.

The imposition of blanket and country-specific duties — which include Wednesday's news of a 25% tariff on all car imports into the U.S., effective from April 2 — have led to a number of retaliatory measures, including from the U.S.' historical transatlantic ally, the European Union. The bloc has also taken steps to bolster its autonomy through a package of proposals that could critically relax previously ironclad fiscal rules and mobilize nearly 800 billion euros ($863.8 billion) toward the region's higher defense expenditures. ""European banks today are ready to lend more and support the economy more. We are strong. We have the capital,"" Botín said. She also called for more ""flexibility"" in EU regulations that currently determine the ""buffers"" European lenders must hold on top of minimum capital requirements to bolster their resilience in the event of financial shocks. The latest EU plans — and Germany's steps to overhaul its long-standing debt policy to accommodate bolstered security spending — have boosted German and European defense stocks in recent weeks. However, Germany is heavily reliant on its beleaguered auto sector — leaving the world's third-largest exporter vulnerable to stark shifts in trade patterns and potentially exposed to recessionary risks as a result of U.S. tariffs, German central bank Governor Joachim Nagel warned earlier this month.

Botín — whose bank is the fifth-largest auto lender in the U.S. and has been pushing to expand its operations transatlantic while shuttering some physical branches in the U.K. — painted an optimistic picture of the state of the European economy, however. ""As of today, we believe the U.S. will slow down more than Europe, other things equal, because Germany is one third of the economy of the euro zone. That's huge. So that's going to give a boost,"" she said, while also acknowledging that recent unpredictability has clouded clarity over the European Central Bank's next monetary policy steps. The central bank is broadly expected to proceed with a 25-basis-point interest rate cut during its next meeting on April 17. It also eased monetary policy in early March and signaled at the time that its monetary policy had become ""meaningfully less restrictive."" ""The fundamentals of the economy are strong, but the uncertainty and volatility [are] at historic levels. So it's a really hard decision. So there is no doubt that tariffs are a tax on consumer[s], it means slower growth, it means higher inflation,"" Botín said. ""How much slower growth and how much higher inflation, we don't know. But when you don't know what's going to happen in the next few months, you're going to wait to buy a car, you're going to wait to buy a fridge. If you're a company … you're going to wait to see where the tariffs hit harder. So this is going to mean a slowdown in activity. That'll point toward lower rates. Inflation will point the other direction."" Botín added that, as a result, ""there's a case to be made for ... rates coming down, but probably not as fast."" Speaking to CNBC's Tso earlier in the day, ECB policymaker Pierre Wunsch also indicated that the U.S. tariff war had encumbered the bank's decision-making. ""If we forget tariffs .... we were going in the right direction. Then the question was more a question of fine tuning of the pace of cuts and where we land,"" he said. ""I was like, you know, inflation might be the boring part of [20]25, and [20]25 is not a boring year. But if you add tariffs to the equation, it's becoming more complicated.""",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/trumps-tariffs-push-will-hit-the-us-harder-than-europe-santander.html,cnbc
"Novo Nordisk says copycat compounders are hurting Wegovy sales, may take legal action","Flags with the logos of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, maker of the blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy are pictures while the company presents the annual report at Novo Nordisk in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, on February 5, 2025.

Copenhagen, DENMARK — Obesity drug giant Novo Nordisk said Thursday that the rampant growth of the U.S.' compounded drug industry was hurting Wegovy sales, and warned it was considering legal action against companies it believes to be violating its intellectual property.

U.S. compounding pharmacies have been allowed to make legal copies of Novo's Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, both known chemically as semaglutide, under a drug shortage ruling by the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA last month declared the shortage over, however, giving compounding pharmacies until May 22 to cease selling copies of the drug. It follows the lifting of a similar shortage label on rival Eli Lilly's Zepbound in December.

CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said that efforts to bolster supply of the wildly popular weight-loss drug had resulted in the drug's removal from a drug shortage list.

""Given the significant growth of compounding in the U.S., it appears to impact Wegovy prescription uptake in 2025 so far,"" Fruergaard Jørgensen told shareholders at the firm's Annual General Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

The big story

India has long harbored ambitions to become a manufacturing powerhouse. A flagship scheme launched five years ago to help the country realize that aim, however, has fallen short of achieving key goals. In 2020, the Indian government launched a production-linked incentive scheme to attract local and foreign businesses to establish and grow operations in the country. The scheme was rolled out as a pilot under the ""Make in India"" initiative which seeks to galvanize the nation's efforts in becoming a manufacturing hub. With an outlay of 1.97 trillion Indian rupees ($23 billion), the PLI program focused on 14 sectors, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, pharmaceuticals and textiles. The scheme, along with other reforms, was expected to help lift the share of manufacturing to 25% of India's gross domestic product by 2025. It has, however, fallen dramatically short of helping meet that target. Manufacturing's share in GDP dropped to 14% in the fiscal year ending March 2025 from over 15% when the scheme was launched. The program had also targeted to generate production/sales worth 15.52 trillion Indian rupees, but as of November 2024 that figure was just about 14 trillion Indian rupees. This has led to speculation that the scheme might not be extended, with Reuters reporting last week that the government will let it lapse in light of disappointing results. Several firms failed to kickstart production, while others that met manufacturing targets found the subsidy pay out to be slow, according to government documents and correspondence seen by Reuters. A statement released by India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry following the report did not address the status of the PLI scheme. Instead, it highlighted the effectiveness of the program, and how it ""incentivized domestic manufacturing, leading to increased production, job creation, and a boost in exports."" According to MCI, 764 companies, including Apple supplier Foxconn , Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries and auto giant Mahindra and Mahindra , signed up for the PLI scheme, with investments standing at $1.61 trillion Indian rupees as of November last year.

Systemic issues

While the fate of India's PLI scheme appears uncertain at this juncture, the issues the country faces in realizing its lofty ambitions need a deeper look. Experts CNBC's Inside India spoke to argue that the cracks in the country's manufacturing sector extend beyond the outcome of the PLI or the ""Make in India"" initiative as a whole. ""There was never a case that the PLI scheme will work out in all 14 sectors. It has worked out in some niche areas, but manufacturing in India has been constrained for a very long time. And this goes back to policy which shielded domestic manufacturing and made it less competitive than other global manufacturing hubs,"" said Dhiraj Nim, a foreign exchange strategist and economist at ANZ Bank. Policy gaps include regulatory burdens, inflexible labor laws and difficulties in doing business, which cumulatively ""could be holding back manufacturing,"" he said. India has also been a services-oriented economy that has traditionally focused on tech and global command center operations over manufacturing, creating a labor force that is not as prepared to participate in manufacturing. A skills gap in sectors such as textile production has impeded India's productivity and output, with other emerging markets including Bangladesh, the Philippines, Vietnam, Morocco and Mexico, faring better, Nim noted. These countries also have cheap labor and a price advantage, given that the ""Indian rupee has not been competitive relative to other currencies for 15-20 years,"" he said. ""These are structural challenges that India has been facing for decades. There is no easy fix,"" Nim added.

Tailwinds

While India has teething issues to contend with in its manufacturing sector, it does have one major advantage: a growing young and urban population with rising disposable incomes to afford quality products. Global conglomerates are increasingly vying for a space in the fifth largest economy to tap these consumers — incentivizing having a presence in the country. ""All major manufacturers already have or are considering having a plant in India,"" Anupam Singhal, global head of manufacturing at the Tata Group-owned TCS Global, told CNBC's Inside India. ""India is considered to be the youngest nation and a lot of young people have aspirations to consume. So, for any company to be competitive, they need to be in India,"" he added. Even companies that had exited are looking to return: Ford Motors is looking to reenter India with a plant in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Aside from favorable demographics, mounting trade tensions between the U.S. and countries such as China, Mexico and Canada have made India a ""strategic location"" for companies to manufacture and export from, said Samir Kapadia CEO of India Index, which helps foreign companies set up operations in the country. With countries such as China staring at increasingly harsh tariffs on exports to the U.S., Kapadia argues, ""nobody can do business there with those kinds of numbers."" ""People are going to India out of necessity,"" he said, adding that it offers ""cost arbitrage and scale,"" alongside a strong comparative advantage in the consumer electronics, aerospace, defense and automotive sectors.

The road ahead

U.S. President Donald Trump's retaliatory tariff plans, however, make India a target as well. And that could erode its appeal as a manufacturing destination. India is reportedly looking at cutting tariffs on 55% of U.S. imports to protect its exports. Currently, its tariffs on imports from the U.S. range between 5% and 30%. While ANZ's Nim said the direct impact of any tariffs by the U.S. on Indian exports ""is going to be very manageable,"" he cautioned that they will drive up the cost of production and make it challenging for companies to employ many workers. India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal expects overall exports, which include services as well, to hit $2 trillion by 2030, from $778.21 billion in the fiscal year 2023-2024. Initiatives to spur this include rebates on duties and taxes on exports and more free trade agreements such as with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland later this year. The South Asian powerhouse currently has 13 FTAs, falling behind emerging markets such as Vietnam, which has 17. Having FTAs will really move the needle for India and help keep its exports favorable — like it has for Vietnam, Nim said. ""It will reduce barriers to trade and help lower costs - which can attract foreign companies to India and help local firms have competitive products. Overall, the manufacturing sector will benefit,"" he added.

Need to know

India's former commerce secretary says the country should resist unilateral concessions in U.S. trade negotiations. Anup Wadhawan urged India not to give in to unilateral concessions and said that any trade-related concessions should be negotiated within the Bilateral Trade Agreement rather than being granted separately. India and the U.S. are engaging in critical trade talks this week ahead of Trump's reciprocal tariffs scheduled for April 2. India looks to shield $66 billion tariff on its exports to the U.S. The Indian government is reportedly open to cutting tariffs on more $23 billion of U.S. imports in the first phase of a trade deal between the countries, two government sources said. This is reportedly the country's the biggest cut in years and is aimed at fending off reciprocal tariffs. There is an urgent need for India to decarbonize its power sector. Radhika Kak, an independent researcher at the Harvard Business School and Varad Pande, a partner at BCG, explore the pressing need for the South Asian powerhouse to decarbonize its energy sector. There are three ways to go about it, they argue: first, by integrating renewable energy into the grid; second, improving energy efficiency; third, leaning into decentralized energy solutions.

On CNBC TV this week, Macquarie Capital's Head of India Equity Research Aditya Suresh said he does not expect a ""meaningful rally"" in India's benchmark indexes. This is because ""earnings need a reset lower [as] expectations are too high,"" he explained. Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities' Managing Director and Co-head Sanjeev Prasad called for a new valuation framework to assess market performance, given increasing levels of uncertainty. ""The valuation frameworks have become very simple,"" he said, adding that investors have been basing their fair value estimates on a company's multiples over the last 3-5 years. ""The historical multiples probably don't hold anymore, they were valid in a certain context; the environment is a lot more different now,"" Prasad added.

Europe wants to pour billions of dollars into its own defense companies — but market watchers say it may not be able to shut American firms out,"New army recruits of the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, during basic training on Nov. 29, 2022 near Prenzlau, Germany.

As Europe plans to pour billions of dollars into defense, many regional leaders are pushing for the money to be spent locally — but some market watchers say it's inevitable that U.S. companies will benefit from the impending security splurge.

""It's only a political willingness to buy more and more from European suppliers rather than suppliers based outside of Europe,"" he said in an interview. ""The U.S. supply their defense equipment systems from U.S. suppliers … Australia does the same, the U.K. does the same — so why should Europe do it differently?""

Meanwhile, Thales CEO Patrice Caine told CNBC earlier this month that Europe should ""take its destiny in its own hands"" and strive to keep new defense budgets in the region.

An official update on the EU's ReArm Europe strategy last week called on member states to ""spend better, work together, and prioritise European companies."" New spending plans said most non-member state countries — including the U.K. and the U.S. — would be shut out of procurement processes unless they signed Security and Defence Partnership agreements with the EU.

Officials — and companies — have made it clear they want to keep the money inside European borders.

Although the EU appears committed to spending as much of its new defense capital as possible in Europe, keeping procurement solely within the region would require a sizable shift. A number of U.S. defense giants currently occupy a big space in the European military supply chain.

Maryland-headquartered Lockheed Martin, for example, has been a supplier to Europe for more than seven decades. In recent years, the firm has partnered with Rheinmetall to provide Germany with a customized rocket artillery system, started production of a HOMAR-A Multiple Launch Rocket System for the Polish government and sold Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to the Netherlands.

U.S. defense giant Northrop Grumman is another major supplier to European militaries that has powered core command and control (C2) systems for NATO and Britain's Ministry of Defense for 25 years.

Since the beginning of this year, RTX's Raytheon — headquartered in Arlington, Virginia — has won a $529 million contract to replenish the Netherlands' Patriot air defense system, as well as a $946 million contract to supply air defense systems to Romania.

Michael Witt, professor of international business and strategy King's College London's Business School, told CNBC that defense decoupling between Europe and the U.S. ""will be extremely difficult in the short term.""

""So, some money will certainly go to U.S. suppliers,"" he said of the new budgets. ""But in the longer term, European defense needs to stand on its own feet, with as little U.S. input as possible because security cooperation by U.S. administrations can no longer be assumed.""

""Of special interest could be spending on nuclear weapons to replace the U.S. umbrella over Europe — warheads, delivery systems, and so on,"" Witt added in emailed comments.

The U.K.'s multibillion-dollar Trident nuclear deterrent program utilizes U.S.-built missiles, and it is reliant on the U.S. for maintenance, according to think-tank Chatham House.

""Continuing to rely on the US for its deterrent seems a risky option,"" researchers at the institution said in commentary published Monday. ""The first Trump administration might have looked like an aberration, but his second term may reflect deeper long-term shifts in US foreign policy … exploring options to develop substitute capabilities with European allies may be the next logical move, despite the challenges.""

Tobias Ellwood, a former U.K. politician who held a senior position in Britain's Ministry of Defense during his parliamentary career, also said the time has come for the U.K. to consider reducing its reliance on American-made defense supplies.

""We have to make this assumption that America isn't going to be there, that they're dialing back,"" he said on a phone call. ""So, what can they deny which we're going to have to fill in?""

Earlier this month, the U.S. temporarily halted military aid to Ukraine after a public clash between the nations' two leaders. Washington's support for Kyiv has since resumed.

""If things go [down] the trajectory that we're seeing, then we can easily see the closing down of defense markets, even our nuclear deterrent, so there's tough questions for us,"" Ellwood told CNBC.",2025-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/european-defense-spending-where-will-the-money-go.html,cnbc
"Heathrow Airport had enough power to avoid shutdown after fire, Britain’s National Grid says","A reads ""Do Not Travel To Heathrow Airport"" at Hounslow Central London Underground station on March 21, 2025. Jaimi Joy | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Heathrow Airport had enough power to remain open on Friday, after the London hub spent most of the day closed due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation, according to Britain's National Grid . Heathrow — Europe's busiest airport — closed down last week after a fire broke out at a nearby electrical substation that supplies it with power. In comments first reported by the Financial Times, National Grid CEO John Pettigrew said that although the substation in question had been damaged in the ""unprecedented"" fire, two others supplying power to Heathrow had been operating as normal throughout the day. ""There was no lack of capacity from the substations,"" he said. ""Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow."" National Grid, a publicly listed company, owns the high-voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. The firm confirmed Pettigrew's comments with CNBC via email on Monday.

A spokesperson for Heathrow argued, however, that it would have been impossible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted after the fire last week. ""As the National Grid's chief executive, John Pettigrew, noted, he has never seen a transformer failure like this in his 30 years in the industry,"" they said in emailed comments on Monday. ""Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted. Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge."" Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye defended the airport's response to what he labeled a ""major incident."" ""We have other substations but to switch them in takes time,"" he said. ""The situation was not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences."" Heathrow has ordered an internal probe into the shutdown and its crisis management plan, while the U.K. government has commissioned its own investigation into the incident. More than 1,300 flights had been scheduled to take off from or arrive at Heathrow on Friday, according to news agency Reuters. More than 120 that were already airborne when Heathrow closed were diverted to other airports or returned to their city of departure. The disruption is widely expected to cost airlines millions of dollars.

As the situation unfolded on Friday, European travel and leisure stocks saw a broad selloff. British Airways owner IAG shed around 1.9% of its value, while Lufthansa lost 1.7%, and Easyjet was down almost 1%. Many regional airline stocks ended Friday's trading session lower, despite recovering from deeper losses seen earlier in the session. On Monday, Europe's travel and leisure shares were trading around 0.4% higher, with IAG up 0.9% and Lufthansa gaining 0.3% by 1:20 p.m. in London. In a statement on Friday, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) — a trade body representing 340 airlines that collectively account for 80% of global air traffic — slammed Heathrow's response to the substation fire. ""This is yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travelers and airlines,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said. ""How is it that critical infrastructure — of national and global importance — is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative. If that is the case — as it seems — then it is a clear planning failure by the airport."" Walsh added that the incident also raised questions about who should bear the costs of taking care of disrupted travelers. ""We must find a fairer allocation of passenger care costs than airlines alone picking up the tab when infrastructure fails,"" he said. Stephen Rooney, a specialist in tourism economics at Oxford Economics, estimated in a note on Friday that the closure would translate to £4.5 million ($5.82 million) in lost tourism revenue for the U.K., while Jonathan Owens, senior lecturer in operations and supply chain management at the University of Salford's Business School, told CNBC on Monday that the economic impact would be ""massive.""

The overseas Apple iPhone encryption battle that could be headed to the U.S. next,"Britain's King Charles and CEO of Apple, Tim Cook walk at Apple's UK Head Office at Battersea Power Station in London, Britain, December 12, 2024.

Privacy advocates worry that a change in an iPhone security feature in the United Kingdom, and the ongoing battle between Apple and the UK government, could have worldwide ripple effects.

Earlier this year, the UK demanded, under the Investigatory Powers Act, that Apple create a backdoor to allow the government to access encrypted data on people's phones. But instead of making a backdoor, Apple burned the whole house down in the UK market, pulling the data protection tool, to avoid having to comply.

""As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services, and we never will,"" Apple said in a statement, adding that it was ""gravely disappointed"" by the government request.

As a result, an estimated 35 million iPhone users in the UK do not have access to the optional end-to-end encryption feature called Advanced Data Protection, which ensures that only users can access their personal data, such as photos and messages.

Apple has lodged an appeal with the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal seeking to overturn the order, and calls have grown for the hearing to be made public.

Data and privacy experts are alarmed.

""This is only bad news, and I'm finding it difficult to call it anything other than a disaster. The loss of end-to-end encryption for cloud storage is wholesale bad — it leaves users less secure and private — but the global consequences tip this into far worse territory,"" said David Ruiz, online privacy expert at Malwarebytes.

""What's particularly galling is that, for more than a decade, the EU has made a justifiable fuss about data transfer between our two nations,"" Ruiz said.

The thinking was that EU citizens' data could not be reasonably protected when it crossed into the U.S. because of the National Security Agency surveillance programs. Trade agreements are intended to iron out the details, Ruiz said, pointing to a Safe Harbor agreement used before it was struck down in 2015, and an agreement called the US-UK Privacy Shield which has been in place since then.

""With the UK's order, I legitimately do not know what happens to the US-UK Privacy Shield,"" he said.

The last time there was an order of this magnitude was the Edward Snowden revelations, when The Guardian revealed that the FBI had asked Verizon for the call details records for incoming and outgoing calls in the United States.

A data security 'earthquake'

Ruiz isn't alone in his concerns.

""This is a wake-up call for CISOs navigating the intersection of security, privacy, and government oversight,"" says Dray Agha, security operations manager at Huntress Labs.

Agha says that while the government wants access to the data, building such a backdoor would create a systemic risk. Oonce a vulnerability is introduced, it's only a matter of time before unintended actors exploit it.

""If governments can access data, so can adversaries: cybercriminals, hostile nation-states, and malicious insiders,"" Agha said, adding that the absence of strong encryption in iCloud increases the risk of insider threats, unauthorized government access, and potential data breaches.

Similar data privacy battles could be coming to the U.S. and other nations.

Ruiz says that this may embolden the ""Five Eyes"" nations (a so-called intelligence alliance consisting of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, and UK), to make a similar demand of Apple.

""Privacy's global dominos are wobbling,"" said Javad Abed, an assistant professor of information systems at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. ""This is a policy earthquake.""

Whether in the UK or globally, the ability to control your own encryption and data sovereignty is becoming a non-negotiable pillar of personal security, Agha said, and users need to recognize that the UK move is a symptom of the growing tension between governments and personal security.

To start, people should check the privacy settings on their phones.

Many consumers have older phones, and those who don't have auto updates enabled may miss critical security updates, which could include messaging apps that allow for end-for-end encryption. Settings on transferred apps might not migrate with a new phone.

""If users have enabled end-to-end encryption for apps on your prior phone, it's also a good idea to check that the settings are enabled on the new phone as well,"" Agha said.

The same advice applies to non-Apple phone users. ""Samsung is not immune, so Galaxy fans should be concerned,"" Agha added.

U.S. privacy protections

Abed says the U.S. government has a long history of wrestling with tech companies over encryption and that the FBI has frequently argued that encryption hampers law enforcement.

""Some lawmakers might see the UK situation as a playbook,"" he said.

UK success in this battle could embolden the U.S. to pursue executive action or application of existing statutes to accomplish a similar aim, but Abed says the U.S. does have strong free speech protections and a fragmented legislative process that would make requiring a backdoor more difficult. ""And the bipartisan backlash would be fierce,"" he said, citing senators on both sides of the aisle — Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) — who have pushed back against weakening protections.

Elle Farrell-Kingsley, a UK-based futurist and tech expert who has helped formulate AI policy research for UK Parliament, says the strong constitutional protections and existing legal precedents that favor encryption in the U.S. are a solid starting point for a broad phone user security firewall.

There does tend to be bipartisan interest in regulating online platforms, especially when it comes to child safety. ""What makes the UK's Online Safety Act particularly noteworthy is now its extraterritorial reach,"" Farrell-Kingsley said, noting that foreign companies serving UK users must comply with the law, which could theoretically affect U.S.-based firms that offer encrypted messaging services in the UK.

She noted that similar proposals have been vaguely discussed in the U.S., such as the proposed EARN IT Act, which would create liability risks for companies that offer encrypted messaging without access for law enforcement. It has been introduced specifically to address child safety concerns, but some civil liberties groups say it is a license for government surveillance.

Farrell-Kingsley says that if the UK's regulatory body enforces compliance, companies would need to decide whether to create UK-specific versions of their products, withdraw services from the UK entirely (as Apple has done with certain features or threaten to leave the UK entirely, as encrypted messaging app Signal has done), or risk penalties.

While she thinks replication of action in the U.S. is unlikely, the consequences would be significant.

""If U.S. lawmakers follow the UK's example, it could lead to expanded government surveillance and a rollback of strong privacy protections,"" she said.

""In short, the loss of end-to-end encryption is bad, yes,"" Ruiz said. ""But the global impact of this demand has extremely dangerous and idiotic potential.""",2025-03-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/apple-uk-battle-on-iphone-security-is-biggest-data-risk-since-snowden.html,cnbc
UK economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in January,"Men and women socialize at the end of the day outside The Castle Pub in London, United Kingdom.

The U.K.'s economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% month-on-month in January, official figures showed on Friday.

Britain's Office for National Statistics said the fall was mainly due to a contraction in the production sector.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the country's GDP to grow by 0.1%.

At 7:35 a.m. in London, shortly after the data release, the British pound was down by around 0.15% against the dollar to trade at $1.293. Sterling was flat against the euro.

Meanwhile, long-term government borrowing costs, which spiked to multi-decade highs earlier this year, rose. The yield on 20-year U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — added 2 basis points, while 30-year gilt yields were up by 4 basis points.

Services output picked up by 0.1% month-on-month in January, but marked a slowdown from the 0.4% hike of December. Production output dropped by 0.9% on the month, after recording a 0.5% rise in the previous month. Monthly construction output meanwhile fell by another 0.2% in January, after also shedding 0.2% in December.

The U.K. economy grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter, beating expectations, ONS data showed last month. It flatlined in the third quarter.

The monthly GDP data has been checkered since then, with a 0.1% contraction in October, a 0.1% expansion in November and a 0.4% month-on-month expansion in December thanks, to growth in services and production.

Friday's GDP release will be the last data print before the U.K. Treasury's ""Spring Statement"" on March 26, when Chancellor Rachel Reeves presents an update on her plans for the British economy.

The statement is released alongside economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the U.K.'s independent economic and fiscal forecaster, which gives its assessment on the likely impact of the government's tax and spending plans.

There have been concerns that the Treasury's fiscal plans, which were laid out last fall and which will increase the tax burden on British businesses, could weigh on investment, jobs and growth. Reeves has defended the tax rises, saying they're a one-off measure and necessary to boost investment in public services.

The Bank of England made its first interest rate cut of the year in February, signaling further cuts were to come as it halved the U.K.'s growth forecast for 2025 from 1.5% to 0.75%.

Markets are widely expecting the Bank of England to hold rates steady at 4.5% at its Monetary Policy Committee meeting next week, LSEG data showed on Friday.

The central bank said it would judge how to balance the need to boost growth with the inflationary risk posed by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The U.K. has not been specifically targeted so far, but its exports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. will fall under Trump's blanket 25% import duties on the metals.

In a note on Friday, Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, said the data highlighted the weakness in the British economy before the impact of rising business taxes and geopolitical uncertainty had fully set in.

""Most of the weakness is just payback from the surprisingly strong 0.4% m/m rise in GDP in December,"" he said. ""In other words, December's figures made the economy look stronger than it really was and January's make it look a bit weaker. The truth is probably that the underlying pace of growth is a little bit above zero.""

He added that although U.S. President Donald Trump's blanket tariffs on steel and aluminum had only come into effect this week, they could already have impacted the U.K. economy.

""The 1.1% m/m fall in manufacturing output was partly due to a 3.3% m/m drop in metals output,"" he explained. ""It's possibly related [to tariffs] as they have been anticipated for a while.""

Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer told politicians he was hopeful the U.K. could still evade Trump's protectionist trade policies.

""I'm disappointed to see global tariffs in relation to steel and aluminium, but we will take a pragmatic approach,"" he said. ""We are negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed, but we will keep all options on the table.""",2025-03-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/uk-monthly-gdp-data-for-january.html,cnbc
Ferrari car buyers are getting younger. CEO says 40% of new clients are now under 40,"Ferraris are becoming increasingly popular among younger buyers, with the CEO of the luxury automaker revealing that 40% of new buyers are now under the age of 40.

That reflects a significant upswing from just over 18 months ago, when Ferrari's chief said the figure stood at 30%.

""40% of the new clients are below 40 years,"" Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told CNBC on the sidelines of CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore.

""I don't know for other brands, but for us, it is an achievement that is thanks to our team,"" he added.

The Maranello, Italy-based manufacturer is well known for keeping a tight rein on the production of its cars, seeking to maintain the brand's promise of exclusivity. Indeed, as of last year, nearly three-quarters of all Ferraris were sold to existing customers.

Famously, founder Enzo Ferrari once said that the company would ""always deliver one less car than the market demands.""

Vigna shared a couple of examples during a fireside chat at CONVERGE LIVE of prospective buyers urging the company to speed up production. He insisted, however, that the more-than-two-year wait time was an integral part of what he described as a ""very pleasant"" experience.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/ferrari-ceo-benedetto-vigna-says-40percent-of-new-clients-are-now-under-40-years-old.html,cnbc

'I hated team sports': How Olympian Michael Johnson learned to be a leader,"LONDON — Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson's sporting career did not get off to the most auspicious start.

""I hated team sports,"" he told an audience at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday, referring to a period when he played football.

""I had a great game once when I was playing football and we lost, and we're on the bus on the way home and everybody's sad, and I'm thinking: I had a good game. I should be happy,"" Johnson said.

""So that told me that I needed to be in individual sport, right?"" he added.

In 1987, when Johnson was 19, his future coach Clyde Hart noticed his athleticism while Johnson was studying at Baylor University, in Waco, Texas. He won his first world title at the 1991 athletics World Championships in Tokyo, taking first place in the 200m race.

Johnson said the first half of his track career was about winning. ""This is going to sound sort of diabolical, but it was just really about beating people as badly as I possibly could,"" he said at CONVERGE LIVE.

Later, he realized that if he was prepared enough, ""I was probably going to win the races."" And so he changed his strategy. ""Then it became about chasing records and chasing history and trying to do things in the sport that had never been done before,"" Johnson said.

He went on to become the only male athlete to take Olympic gold at both the 200m and 400m sprint events, doing so during the 1996 Summer games in Atlanta, Georgia.",2025-03-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/michael-johnson-i-hated-team-sports.html,cnbc
OpenAI exec reveals the tech giant's 'biggest challenge' right now,"Unlike many other companies, OpenAI does not struggle with market demand, Oliver Jay, managing director of international strategy at OpenAI, said at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE Thursday.

Instead, ""the biggest challenge right now is ... converting that enthusiasm into real-life production-ready use case,"" he said. ""The gap is AI fluency — to know how to turn these concepts into actual business products.""

He said this is difficult because ""working with large language models is a new paradigm. It's not software. You need to build guardrails.""

London’s Heathrow Airport resumes flights after major fire nearby shuts down travel,"watch now

London's Heathrow Airport closed Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage, disrupting travel for tens of thousands of passengers planning to fly in or out of Europe's busiest airport. The first flight since the closure departed late Friday local time, and Heathrow posted on X that it hopes to run a ""full operation"" on Saturday. More than 800 flights were canceled in and out of the airport on Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, as of the most recent update, upending travel at the major hub and connecting airport. Airlines warned travelers that disruptions could continue into the weekend, and Heathrow posted that travelers shouldn't go to the airport unless advised to do so by their airline.

London's Metropolitan Police said that while there was ""no indication of foul play,"" the counterterrorism division would now lead the investigation into the fire. ""Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries,"" the force said in a post on X. ""This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimise disruption and identify the cause,"" it said. ""Heathrow is experiencing a significant power outage across the airport. ... Whilst fire crews are responding to the incident, we do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored,"" a Heathrow spokesperson said earlier Friday.

Canceled and diverted flights

More than 120 flights were already in the air when the closure was announced and were diverted or returned to their originating airports, according to Flightradar24. Nearly three-quarters of the flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow, or 500 flights, and half of the arrivals destined for the airport, 300 flights, were also scrubbed. Airlines around the world due to operate flights into and out of Heathrow told passengers to stay home. The fire and airport closure left thousands of travelers stranded. British Airways was the most affected airline, with over half of its Friday schedule canceled. The airline said it would offer ""flexible options"" for rebooking to passengers set to travel to or from Heathrow on Friday through the weekend, in an online post. ""Our teams are currently working hard to review our long-haul schedule as well as the implications for our schedule tomorrow and beyond,"" it said in a statement. As the fire appears to be outside of the airlines' control, they may not be required to cover compensation, according to a note issued by Citi on Friday. American Airlines , a British Airways partner across the Atlantic, said almost 20 flights from Thursday were diverted or canceled and that it provided overnight hotels for affected customers. It canceled another close to 20 in or out of London on Friday, she said. The carrier planned to operate its full schedule to and from London on Saturday. European travel and leisure stocks fell on news of the airport closure.

Ed Miliband, U.K. energy minister, described the fire as ""catastrophic,"" according to Reuters, adding that the airport's backup generator had been affected by the blaze. Speaking to ITV's ""Good Morning Britain,"" Miliband said the National Grid told him ""it's like a fire they've never, kind of, quite seen anything like the scale of what happened before,"" according to a post by the program on X. Miliband added that the National Grid was trying to use another backup system to restore power to the airport. Power cuts also affected about 16,000 homes around the airport. As of 8 a.m. GMT, electrical supply was restored to all but around 4,900, according to the U.K. energy company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks.

'It makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable'

Heathrow Airport has an estimated 1,300 takeoffs and landings at the airport per day, according to its website. It handled a record 83.9 million passengers last year — a nearly 6% increase from 2023. Speaking to ""Good Morning Britain,"" Miliband said on Friday, ""We've got to understand why this happened, and we've got to work out what the lessons are for the resilience of our infrastructure.""

He said the National Grid is looking at whether there is ""sufficient resilience"" in place at the airport, given that the fire also affected a backup generator. ""It makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable. And therefore, we've got to learn lessons … about not just Heathrow, but how we protect our major infrastructure,"" Miliband said. Willie Walsh, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, an airline industry group, criticized Heathrow Airport for being ""totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative,"" in an online statement, describing it as a ""total planning failure"" by the airport. Walsh questioned who would cover the costs of the resulting travel disruptions. ""We must find a fairer allocation of passenger care costs than airlines alone picking up the tab when infrastructure fails,"" he said. ""Until that happens, Heathrow has very little incentive to improve.""

People are selling Singapore Airlines miles online. Here's what the airline says about that,"In this article SIAL-SG Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

When Tracy Ren decided to go to the 2024 Summer Olympics, she booked her flight to Paris on Singapore Airlines using miles. But she didn't earn them — she bought them. Rather than purchasing miles directly from the airline, which sells 1,000 miles for around $40, Ren turned to Carousell, a popular online marketplace in Asia-Pacific that sells new and used goods — and, increasingly, loyalty points and rewards. By purchasing miles online, ""the cost is nearly 50% compared with purchasing the ticket,"" Ren said.

Is this allowed?

Buying and selling airline miles online isn't illegal, said Aaron Wong, founder of the travel and loyalty website The MileLion. Nor does it violate Carousell's terms of service. The company, which forbids weapon and cryptocurrency sales, told CNBC Travel via a representative that: ""The governance of sale of airline miles and points depends on the Terms and Conditions ... [of] the airline ... Carousell is not privy to and not in a position to enforce these third-party agreements."" This is where online sellers rule afoul of the rules, said Wong. Singapore Airline's loyalty program terms state that ""the sale or barter of KrisFlyer miles ... is prohibited.""

""The question, then, isn't so much about whether or not you can ... but whether or not you can get away with it,"" said Wong. If any airline catches travelers buying or selling miles, the miles can be forfeited or their traveler's loyalty account can be closed, he said. Separately, buyers also run the risk of losing their money to online scammers, he said.

How it works

Some sellers transfer credit card points directly to a buyer's Krisflyer account, Wong said. The names on the two accounts need to match, he said, but added that ""stuff falls through the cracks."" A more common method is to name a buyer as a ""nominee"" under Singapore Airline's KrisFlyer program, he said. Members can ""nominate up to five individuals"" they can redeem flights for using their miles, according to the program.

There is nothing which I am doing which contravenes any terms and conditions. A KrisFlyer member

One Singapore-based KrisFlyer member who spoke to CNBC said he's been using this method to sell his miles to strangers on Carousell — priced at $17 Singapore dollars ($12.75) per 1,000 miles — for the past year and a half. The seller, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his identity at work, said buyers must share their passport details to be designated as a nominee. ""Since I have to have their personal details, I share my details with them as well. I share with them my proof of address ... my phone number,"" he said. ""It gives them additional comfort in case anything goes wrong."" And things do go awry, he said. He's twice had to intervene with tickets he redeemed for others, he said, including an instance where a buyer asked to postpone a flight on the day of departure. ""In that situation, it worked out pretty OK, but if he would have called me 15 minutes later, I would be in a meeting for an hour,"" the seller said, adding that the buyer promptly paid the flight change fee as well. He said Singapore's small size and low crime rate make it easier to sell airline miles in the city-state. ""It's a fairly compliant society. People usually do not take each other for a ride,"" he said.

Why sellers sell

Another seller, who declined to give his name or allow CNBC to use his Carousell screen name, said he began selling KrisFlyer miles more than 10 years ago after amassing more points — mainly through credit card purchases — than he could use. Plus, he was always ""being chased with the expiry,"" he said. His Carousell listing says he sells 1,000 miles for $15 to $25 — depending on the purchase method and number of miles bought. He had six ""five-star"" reviews for miles sales in the past month, with buyers raving about his ""fast"" and ""hassle-free"" transactions. However, the first seller CNBC spoke to said he sells points for an entirely different reason — to buy flights for his family on cheaper carriers. ""Singapore Airlines ends up being a very expensive airline to fly, so I would rarely spend my own money to fly on [it],"" he said. ""You sell those miles, you get the funds, and the same funds are used for your other bookings.""

Plus, he usually books trips about six weeks in advance — by that time, redemption flights are usually sold out, he said. He also said he doesn't buy products using KrisFlyer miles because ""the arithmetic does not stack up."" This seller told CNBC he doesn't feel he is breaking any rules. ""The airline regulations say that the people need to be added as a nominee in my account,"" he said. ""There is nothing which I am doing which contravenes any terms and conditions."" However, when asked about the sale of KrisFlyer miles on Carousell using Singapore Airlines' nominee system, a representative said that the program's terms ""strictly prohibit the sale or barter of KrisFlyer miles, Elite miles, PPS value, rewards, award tickets, or other benefits."" ""Members who engage in such activities risk the cancellation of these benefits,"" the representative said. ""SIA collaborates closely with relevant authorities to monitor these platforms and will take decisive action against any member who contravenes these rules.""

Singapore is more expensive than regional peers. So it's using a different playbook to attract visitors,"A night view of Singapore's ""Supertrees,"" a collection of sustainable vertical gardens at the city's Gardens by the Bay. Athanasios Gioumpasis | Getty Images News | Getty Images

British national Tony Cross first set foot in Singapore in 1992, when the city-state's main draws were its glitzy malls, the pulsating Zouk nightclub and the renowned Singapore Zoo. Today, shopping has taken a backseat, as prices for goods have climbed alongside commercial rents in a city where space is scarce. And, Singapore's once-thriving clubbing industry is facing tough times, hurt by high costs and shifting alcohol consumption habits. Competition from other Southeast Asian cities, which are far cheaper to visit, is heating up too. Rather than competing on price, Singapore is relying on world-class attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and the expanding Mandai Wildlife Reserve to draw both budget and luxury travelers alike. Others arrive for business conferences and live events, from the annual Formula One night race to concerts by megastars like Taylor Swift and Coldplay. This year, Singapore is hosting concerts by Lady Gaga on May 18, 19, 21 and 24 — her only stop in Asia-Pacific — according to Singapore Airlines, whose reward program, KrisFlyer, is a concert partner. ""Singapore built itself a brilliant position as accessible Southeast Asia in the '80s and '90s. But many other cities in the region have now upped their game, too,"" said Cross, a financial consultant who has visited the island nation some 20 times over the last three decades.

The experience economy

Singapore attracted 16.5 million overseas visitors in 2024, an increase of 21% from 2023, according to the Singapore Tourism Board. The numbers do not include the hundreds of thousands of people who enter Singapore daily via two bridges that connect Singapore to Malaysia. That's a huge increase from 1992, when the city-state attracted fewer than 6 million visitors, according to the country's National Archives. However, it's still shy of the 19.1 million who arrived in 2019.

The Singapore Tourism Board forecasts visitor arrivals will grow to between 17 million and 18.5 million this year, boosted by a slew of lifestyle and MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions) events, as well as new attractions ranging from Rainforest Wild Asia, a park that opened last week, to the Disney Adventure cruise ship scheduled to set sail in December. The Singapore Tourism Board told CNBC Travel it will continue to support projects that deliver interactive experiences in line with the global shift towards experiential travel. Galastein Tan, the former head of major events at the company that manages the Singapore Sports Hub, the venue for Taylor Swift's concerts last year, said Singapore needs a vibrant tourism sector to attract and retain the human capital that makes it a global city. This involves developing a portfolio of fixed assets like Marina Bay Sands and ""liquid"" assets such as concerts and sporting and cultural events. Having a wide range of tourism attractions will also boost domestic spending and create jobs locally, he said.

Singapore's retail and food and beverage sectors contracted last year even as the overall economy expanded by 4.4%, as increased spending by Singapore residents abroad offset the increase in tourism receipts. ""The challenge remains for Singapore to stay ahead as regional countries and cities are catching up and beefing up their own unique tourism portfolios,"" Tan said. ""Tourists have more options now.""

Pricey hotels and cheap food

Expedia, the online travel giant, said searches for flights to Singapore from China, Indonesia and India — the city-state's three largest sources of visitors — slipped 1% for the period from February to July 2025, compared with the preceding six-month period. Searches for lodging also fell 2% during the same period, the company said. Singapore remains a popular destination for MICE events, ranking No. 2 after Paris in the International Congress and Convention Association's 2023 city ranking. Thailand and Malaysia, however, are making inroads into the sector, owing to lower costs and improving infrastructure.

Singapore is the perfect location to hold events ... but the costs are very high. Albert Lee Event organizer

Albert Lee, a Malaysian event organizer, said quality convention space in Kuala Lumpur can be rented for roughly half what it costs in Singapore, while a dinner for 40 at a nice restaurant with entertainment and transportation can be arranged at one-third the price. Costs in Bangkok are comparable to Kuala Lumpur, he added. ""Singapore is the perfect location to hold events — it is nice, safe, accessible and STB is very helpful. But the costs are very high,"" he said. Lee noted that although Kuala Lumpur doesn't have iconic hotels like Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, the city's five-star hotels cost a lot less. For example, a room at the Shangri-la Singapore costs $500 Singapore dollars ($375) a night versus SG$170 a night at its sister hotel in Kuala Lumpur, a review of Hotels.com showed.

Finding value

The Singapore Tourism Board has been trying to change the perception that Singapore is expensive by emphasizing how much a visitor can do in one day thanks to Singapore's public transport system, a point that Cross also made. ""We have worked with various influencers to showcase how Singapore offers not just value for money, but also how travelers can maximize their itinerary and time in our destination,"" a spokesperson said. Japanese businessman Yoshihiko Tano, who visits Singapore often to catch up with friends, said that while hotels are costly, eating out is cheap, thanks to the many hawker centers where a meal and drink can be purchased for less than SG$10.

Social media chatter about Thailand pops 60% following ‘White Lotus’ premiere,"Social media conversations about traveling in Thailand rose 60% after the premiere of the third season of ""The White Lotus"" on Feb. 16. The data measured social media chatter during the three days before and after the show's airing, according to social media analytics company Sprout Social. The Emmy-winning HBO series is expected to draw a surge in travel interest to the Thai island of Koh Samui, the latest setting of the show — as it did to Maui, Hawaii, and Sicily, Italy, in seasons one and two, respectively. The show's ability to draw tourism interest to its filming locations is so influential that it's known as the ""White Lotus effect."" ""The White Lotus"" was mentioned on social media nearly 1,385,000 times by nearly 500,000 unique authors from Feb. 16-26, according to Sprout Social. Most conversations came from within Thailand (86,016), followed by the United States (45,728) and Brazil (18,613), the company told CNBC Travel.

The conversations garnered more than 8.4 million engagements — mostly from likes, comments and shares — of which 85% were positive, it said. However, for the posts that specifically mention Thailand, sentiment rose to 99%, according to Sprout Social. This is important because the reach of these posts is so vast, said Rachael Goulet, the company's director of social media. ""There were more than 775 million instances where conversations mentioning both 'The White Lotus' and Thailand appeared on users' feeds,"" said Goulet. ""For context, the U.S. population is just over 340 million, so at more than 2x that number, 775 million potential impressions don't just indicate a strong trend on social media; it indicates a broader cultural moment."" The data is based on social media conversations across X, YouTube, Reddit, and Tumblr, Sprout Social said. ""People aren't just talking about the show as something to watch; they're talking about it as a reason to travel to Thailand,"" said Goulet.

Moreover, this season has something prior ones didn't have — the power of a pop star. The cast includes Lalisa Manobal — more commonly known as Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink. Manobal, who has around 105 million followers on Instagram, made her acting debut as ""Mook"" in the latest season.

Hotel and restaurant bookings

But it's not all talk — travel searches have jumped, in many instances, months before the third season started. Search interest for Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, the show's main filming location, surged 370% in Hong Kong in January year on year, according to Expedia. In the two weeks after the third season's premiere, searches for trips to Koh Samui jumped 115% in Singapore, 95% in the United States, and 70% in Australia, Expedia's data showed. Booking are up too. Since the season premiere, Trip.com has seen a year-on-year growth of nearly 30% in flight and hotel bookings to Koh Samui, led by Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The ""White Lotus effect"" may be boosting interest to other parts of Thailand too. Short-term rental bookings in Thailand surged nearly 500% in the two days following the season three premiere, compared with the same period from 2024, according to the property management platform Guesty, whose software powers reservations on Airbnb and Booking.com, among others.

Annual nightly rates for short-term home rentals rose too — some 28% from February of 2024, according to Guesty. Average daily rates at hotels climbed 10% in the two weeks before and the season premiere, according to Expedia. That is on top of rising rates, which started to climb during the post-pandemic travel surge. ""The White Lotus"" may even be boosting restaurant reservations beyond Thailand's shores. Bookings at Thai restaurants in the United States increased 16% in the week following the show's premiere, according to the reservation service OpenTable.

Concerns about overtourism

Dr. Guy Llewellyn, assistant professor at EHL Hospitality Business School, said the ""White Lotus effect"" demonstrates the power that pop culture has on travel trends, especially on younger travelers who use social media for travel inspiration. However, he said past instances of screen tourism serve as cautionary tales.

The first generation is external. Things like smartwatches or rings, which use sensors to track our steps and heart rate. Or smart glasses, which function as cameras, headphones and monitors.

The second generation is internal. These are devices you ingest or have implanted. Think of pacemakers with digital implants, smart prosthetics hardwired into patients' nerves and muscles... or even digital pills that transmit medical data after being ingested.

Finally, there's the third generation. These devices completely merge with the body while maintaining a real-time connection to an external machine and the internet.

One of the most notable companies in this space is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which is developing a brain-computer interface, or BCI called ""the Link.""

The coin-sized chip is implanted under the skull, where it can read a person's brain signals and allow them to control an external machine.

Neuralink's first test subject, who was paralyzed from the shoulders down, used the device to play chess on his laptop. Although a few weeks after the procedure, Neuralink reported some malfunctioning.

Proponents of IoB devices say the benefits are clear: they'll improve body cognition and function, improve healthcare, and allow for significant cost savings for people and corporations. But where some see benefits, others see risks. Even the original article coining the term warned against the technology's flaws.

For one, data protection will be paramount. Many of these devices will be able to track, record and store personal information. Critics argue that if governments and companies got their hands on this data, they could use it to spy on citizens or turn them into revenue streams. There are also concerns around dependency, addiction and personal safety. Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, for example, admitted that he had his heart implant's wireless function disabled in 2007 over fears that assassins could use it to cause a fatal heart attack.

There are also ethical questions to consider. Could we see a world in which the rich are augmented, and the poor aren't? And philosophically, will IoB challenge our notions of human autonomy and self-governance? Who is responsible for monitoring the risks?

Most IoB implantable and ingestible devices are regulated by agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or its counterparts internationally.

They have a set of rules for things like cochlear implants or body-part replacements, but IoB consumer devices are not under their purview. The recent emergence of these devices, their fast boom in sales and their varying capabilities somewhat explains the current patchwork of legislation at regional, state and international levels. However, there are some existing laws that could be extended to safeguard IoB data.

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation – or GDPR – is designed to protect EU residents from the dangers of data breaches and cyber-attacks.

And in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act – commonly known as HIPAA – is meant to prevent a patient's information from being disclosed without consent.

As an industry, there's a lot to play for. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global connected medical device market alone will be worth around 66 billion dollars in 2024 and is expected to reach more than 132 billion by 2029. That's an annual growth rate of nearly 15%.",2024-05-31 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/31/what-is-the-internet-of-bodies.html,cnbc
How the world got into $315 trillion of debt,"Here is a transcript of the video.

The world is in debt. To the tune of $315 trillion and counting.

Borge Brende: We haven't seen this kind of debt since the Napoleonic wars. We're getting close to 100% of Global GDP.

$315 trillion is a staggering number to visualize but consider this. In 2024, global gross domestic product — or GDP — amounted to $109.5 trillion — slightly over a third of that global debt number.

Another way to picture it? There are about 8.1 billion of us living in the world today. If we were to divide that debt up by person, each of us would owe about $39,000.

So, with global debt at a record high, should you be concerned? And how did we get here in the first place?

Global debt combines borrowings from households, businesses and governments.

You're probably most familiar with household debt, which includes things like mortgages, credit card and student debt. At the beginning of 2024, this amounted to $59.1 trillion.

Business debt, which corporations use to finance their operations and growth, sat at $164.5 trillion, with the financial sector alone making up $70.4 trillion of that amount.

Finally, there's government debt, which is used to help fund public services and projects without raising taxes.

Countries can borrow from each other or from global institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

But governments can also raise money by selling bonds... which is essentially an IOU from the state to investors. And like all loans, it includes interest.

Public debt stood at $91.4 trillion. While debt may have a bad rap, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could help an individual get an education or join the property ladder. It enables businesses to start up and scale up. And though national debt is the most contentious of the three, it can give governments the leverage they need to build the economy, for social spending, or respond to a crisis.

Written record shows public debt has been around for at least 2,000 years, primarily used to establish towns, cities, states and nations... and to fund wars. Governments have long amassed heavy debts from wartime expenses, such as the Napoleonic Wars, Franco-Prussian War and U.S. Civil War in the 19th century.

World War II, the most expensive war in history, triggered several debt crises, with most of the outstanding loans being owed to the United States.

Since the 1950s, there have been four major waves of debt accumulation.

The first debt wave originated from Latin America in the 1980s, which led 16 countries in that region to restructure their borrowings.

The second wave impacted Southeast Asia at the turn of the 21st century, while the U.S. and Europe took the brunt of the third global debt wave during the 2007–2008 global financial crisis.

We are now in the fourth wave, which began in 2010, and coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic. Governments had to take on even more debt to help businesses and its citizens cushion the impact of lockdowns.

Global debt rose to 256 percent of GDP in 2020, a 28-percentage point increase - and the biggest one-year debt rise since the Second World War.

But the pandemic just exacerbated a problem that was already there. Debt had been piling up for at least a decade before, as individuals, companies and governments spent beyond their means. Just look at this graph from the World Bank, which shows debt as a percentage of GDP, rapidly climbing from 2008.

This brings us to a critical question: how much debt is too much debt? When does it become unsustainable?

Put simply, it's when you can no longer afford it.

So, for example, when a government is forced to make cuts in areas that hurt its people, such as education or healthcare, just to keep up with payments.

Take Zambia for instance. In 2021, debt servicing accounted for 39% of its national budget. That year, the government spent more on paying these debts than education, health, water and sanitation combined. And it's completely hampered the nation's ability to invest in its future.

Debt-to-GDP ratio is the economic metric that compares a country's government debt to its gross domestic product. It's usually presented as a percentage and is seen as a good indicator of that country's ability to service its debts.

So, let's pretend we have two countries, each with $30 billion in debt. Sounds like they have the same problem, right? But if it turns out that one of those countries has a $30 billion economy, and the other has a nearly $30 trillion economy, it's clear which country is shouldering the bigger debt burden.

This, often coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange and interest rates, is why debt is seen as riskier for smaller economies.

But there are, of course, exceptions.

Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, is also one of the world's most indebted countries, with total debt sitting above 600% of GDP. And while the bulk of Japan's debt is public, in recent years, it has been the financial sector piling on – not the government.

Around two-thirds of the $315 trillion owed originates from mature economies with Japan and the United States contributing the most to that debt pile. But generally, the debt-to-GDP ratio for mature economies has been coming down.

On the other hand, emerging markets held $105 trillion in debt, but the EM debt-to-GDP ratio hit a new high of 257% - pushing the overall ratio up for the first time in three years. China, India and Mexico were the biggest contributors.

The fourth wave has been the biggest, fastest and most wide-ranging rise in debt we've seen since World War II. Better policies and financial regulations have kept a far-reaching debt crisis at bay.

But with so much money on the line, the prospect of a stronger dollar or a trade war could be enough to tip a country - or several - into default.",2024-05-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/28/how-the-world-got-into-315-trillion-of-debt.html,cnbc
eVTOLS: Are flying cars finally becoming reality?,"Inventors have been fixated on the idea of ""flying cars"" for nearly as long as they have been on the road, with prototypes dating as far back as the 1940s.

Innovators and investors today, however, prefer the acronym eVTOL, which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing.

As the name suggests, eVTOLS are powered by electricity, not fuel. They take off and land vertically, like what you're used to seeing with a helicopter, but many also fly like a traditional aircraft.

More than 400 companies and innovators have registered designs on the World eVTOL Aircraft Directory. CNBC has focused on eVTOL companies like Lilium , EHang , Alef and mentions Joby Aviation , Archer Aviation and Vertical Aerospace .

The broader industry has attracted billions of dollars in funding over the last decade. For some, those investments could really pay off. One Markets and Markets forecast estimated that the eVTOL market will grow from $1.2 billion in 2023 to $23.4 billion in 2030. That's an annual average growth rate of 52%.

So, are we in the golden age of eVTOL development or the ""mother of all aerospace bubbles?""

How China's property bubble burst,"Desperate property developers in China have resorted to gifts like new cars, free parking spaces, phones and other consumer goods to attract homebuyers and boost flagging sales.

These incentives are just the tip of the iceberg in a crisis involving hundreds of billions of dollars in home builder debt, trillions in local government debt and at least a billion empty apartments.

But it wasn't always the case. Since China's economic liberalization in the 1970s and housing reforms in the late 1980s, locals have flocked to properties as the investment vehicle of choice over alternatives such as the stock market.

The property and construction boom helped fuel China's – and the world's – economic growth for 30 years. By some estimates, property in China was worth $60 trillion at its peak, making it the biggest asset class in the world.

Developers like Evergrande and Country Garden got extremely rich in the process.

As property values soared and Chinese households piled on more debt, Beijing attempted to cool its housing market and rein in risky business behavior. Spooked, Chinese consumers soured on property purchases.

But the country's property crisis has deeper roots than speculation and uncontrollable debt. Watch the video to find out how China's property bubble burst.",2024-02-29 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/02/29/how-chinas-property-bubble-burst.html,cnbc
"Trump's tariffs are making the ECB's interest rate path 'more complicated,' policymaker says","U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are making the path ahead for European Central Bank interest rates ""more complicated,"" according to Pierre Wunsch, member of the ECB's Governing Council.

""We were going in the right direction. And I was actually quite relaxed,"" he told CNBC's Karen Tso on Thursday on the sidelines of the IIF Europe Summit in Brussels.

""If we forget tariffs .... we were going in the right direction. Then the question was more a question of fine tuning of the pace of cuts and where we land,"" Wunsch said. ""I was like, you know, inflation might be the boring part of [20]25, and [20]25 is not a boring year. But if you add tariffs to the equation, it's becoming more complicated,"" he said.

Wunsch, who is also the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, said tariffs would be ""bad for growth"" and ""probably"" inflationary, but noted that the exact impact remains uncertain and will depend any potential retaliation and on how exchange rates react to duties.

His comments come a day after Trump announced 25% tariffs on all cars ""not made in the United States,"" effective as of April 2. In a post on Truth Social, Trump on Thursday also threatened to place ""far larger"" tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they were to work together to resist duties from the U.S.

These are just the latest developments in Trump's trade policy turmoil, which has seen a slew of tariffs announced — and at times postponed, amended or abolished, as negotiations and counter measures have also come into play.

April 2 is set to be a key date for a wide range of duties to come into effect, although recent comments from Trump and his administration have signaled that adjustments could be made and the duties could be more lenient than originally indicated.",2025-03-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/ecbs-wunsch-trump-tariffs-are-making-rate-path-more-complicated.html,cnbc
Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to join global advisory board for bond giant Pimco,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC's Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.

Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be joining an advisory board for bond giant Pimco, CNBC has learned.

Joining other prominent officials in the world of economics and finance, Yellen, who also served as Federal Reserve chair, will serve on the board that meets several times a year, according to the report from CNBC's Leslie Picker.

The advisory board members' mission, according to the Pimco website, is to ""contribute their insights to the firm on global economic, political and strategic developments and their relevance for financial markets.""

Current members include Gordon Brown, the former U.K. prime minister; ex-White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten; Michèle Flournoy, former defense policy advisor under two U.S. presidents; and Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former governor for the Reserve Bank of India.

In addition, former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke also served as a senior advisor at Pimco, and Richard Clarida, who had served as the central bank's vice chair, is a managing director in the firm's New York office.

Yellen served as head of Treasury during all four years of the Biden administration, and before that was Fed chair from 2014-18. She was the first woman to hold the respective posts. Prior to taking the Treasury post, she served a stint as a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.

Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, manages about $2 trillion for clients and once ran the largest bond fund in the world. Yellen has a past with the firm, reporting once that she collected a $180,000 speaking fee at the firm in 2019.

"Treasury Department is set to lay off a 'substantial' number of employees, official says","People take pictures of the U.S. Treasury Department building in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 6, 2025.

The Treasury Department is planning to furlough a ""substantial"" level of its workforce in conjunction with Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government, according to a court document.

As part of a complaint in a related case, Trevor Norris, the department's deputy assistant secretary in human resources, indicated that the layoffs will be coming as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's ongoing moves to cut the federal employee rolls.

In a sworn statement, Norris said the Treasury is wrapping up plans to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order backing DOGE's activity. The Treasury currently has more than 100,000 employees.

""These plans will be tailored for each bureau, and in many cases will require separations of substantial numbers of employees through reductions in force (RIFs),"" Norris said in an affidavit.

The case involves a complaint by the state of Maryland to get a stay on the layoffs. In recent days, three judges have issued restraining orders putting temporary halts on DOGE's efforts to hit several departments.

""The Treasury Department is considering a number of measures to increase efficiency, including a rollback of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions to improve both efficiency and quality of service,"" a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement. ""No final decisions have yet been made, and any current reporting to the contrary is false.""

Bloomberg News first reported the planned layoffs.

British businesses pile on the pressure on UK Financial Minister Reeves ahead of budget update,"Rachel Reeves, UK chancellor of the exchequer, outside 11 Downing Street ahead of presenting her budget to parliament in London, UK, on Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024.

Home improvement retailer Kingfisher became the latest British company to report a negative impact from U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves' October budget — as she prepares her latest update on the state of the British economy.

In its annual earnings release on Tuesday, Kingfisher, which owns home improvement retailer B&Q, said the government's policies had ""raised costs for retailers and impacted consumer sentiment,"" with sales of big-ticket items falling.

It is the latest in a line of British businesses that have criticized Reeves' bumper tax-rising budget since autumn. The companies will now be keeping a close eye on Reeves' Spring Statement, when she's set to update lawmakers on her latest spending and taxation plans at 12:30 p.m. London time Wednesday.

Top on the businesses' list of complaints is a higher employment cost after the government pledged in October to increase national insurance contributions from employers and raised the country's ""national living wage"" by 6.7% from April 1.

On Sunday, Reeves defended the tax rises ahead of the Wednesday statement, telling Sky News the government ""took the action that was necessary to ensure our public services and public finances were on a firm footing.""

However, a number of consumer-facing businesses have flagged concerns with the Labour government's economic policies in their earnings reports this quarter. They include supermarket giant Tesco, which said its higher national insurance contributions could add up to £250 million ($324 million) to annual costs, while the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, said the changes will cost every one of his pubs £1,500 per week.

Regis Schultz, CEO of sportswear retailer JD Sports, said the policies mean it was tempting for businesses to reduce staff numbers and hours, ""which will be bad news for the economy.""

It comes as the U.K. battles economic sluggishness, rising prices and widespread uncertainty as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the country's independent public finances watchdog, is reportedly expected to downgrade the U.K.'s growth forecasts for 2025 on Wednesday, halving its previous 2% estimate.

AB Foods, which owns budget fashion retailer Primark, blamed the Labour government's budget as contributing to broader consumer weakness in the country. Finance Director Eoin Tonge told analysts that customers across its brands were cautious, citing ""a shock and a fear, that's driven people to pull in their horns."" That view was shared by clothing retailer Frasers Group, which said it saw weaker consumer confidence around the budget announcement. The company's Chief Financial Officer Chris Wootton told Reuters the company ""felt we'd been kicked in the face.""

The slew of negative corporate commentary is expected to pile pressure on Reeves ahead of her Spring Statement.

The British Retail Consortium has called on the government to ""inject confidence into the economy,"" warning that April's rise in tax contributions and the minimum wage will generate £5 billion in additional costs for retailers, giving ""many no option but to push prices up.""

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said Reeves ""must inject business with a serious confidence boost"" on Wednesday.

""As an immediate priority the government should re-commit to not raising the business tax burden further over the course of this Parliament,"" Louise Hellem, chief economist of the CBI, said in a statement. ""Setting an ambitious goal for R&D spending, making it easier to invest in skills and taking measures to reduce the regulatory burden on business would be encouraging moves that would show the government understood what business needs to see from them.""

Goldman Sachs Chief Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer meanwhile told CNBC on Monday that concerns over consumer and business confidence will see Reeves focus on cutting costs rather than raising taxes this week, but said the government's focus on boosting growth was ""a laudable objective, a difficult thing to do.""

CNBC has reached out to the U.K. Treasury for comment.

Consumer confidence in where the economy is headed hits 12-year low,"Shoppers walk near a Nordstrom store at the Westfield UTC shopping center on Jan. 31, 2025 in San Diego, California.

Consumer confidence dimmed further in March as the view of future conditions fell to the lowest level in more than a decade, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.

The board's monthly confidence index of current conditions slipped to 92.9, a 7.2-point decline and the fourth consecutive monthly contraction. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a reading of 93.5.

However, the measure for future expectations told an even darker story, with the index tumbling 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the 80 level that is considered a signal for a recession ahead.

The index measures respondents' outlook for income, business and job prospects.

""Consumers' optimism about future income — which had held up quite strongly in the past few months — largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,"" said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board.

The survey comes amid worries over President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on U.S. imports, which has coincided with a volatile stock market and other surveys showing waning sentiment.

The fall in confidence was driven by a decline in those 55 or older but was spread across income groups.

In addition to the general pessimism, the outlook for the stock market slid sharply, with just 37.4% of respondents expecting higher equity prices in the next year. That marked a 10 percentage point drop from February and was the first time the view turned negative since late 2023.

The view on the labor market also weakened, with those expecting more jobs to be available falling to 16.7%, while those expecting fewer jobs rose to 28.5%. The respective February readings were 18.8% and 26.6%.

"The probability of a recession is approaching 50%, Deutsche markets survey finds","Additionally, Fed officials raised their outlook for core inflation to 2.8%, well above the central bank's 2% goal, though they still expect to achieve that level by 2027.

Still, Powell and his colleagues at the two-day policy meeting that concluded Wednesday lowered their estimate for gross domestic product this year to just a 1.7% annualized gain. Excluding the Covid-induced retrenchment in 2020, that would be the worst growth rate since 2011.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week acknowledged the worries but said he still sees the economy as ""strong overall"" featuring ""significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.""

Though unemployment remains low and most data points suggest continuing if not slowing growth, the survey results reinforce the message from sentiment surveys that consumers and business leaders are increasingly concerned that a slowdown or recession is a growing risk.

The probability of a downturn in growth over the next 12 months is about 43%, as set by the average view of 400 respondents during the period of March 17-20.

Chances that the U.S. is heading for a recession are close to 50-50, according to a Deutsche Bank survey that raises more questions about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The combination of higher inflation and slower growth raise the specter of stagflation, a phenomenon not experienced since the early 1980s. Few economists see that era replicated in the current environment, though the probability is rising of a policy challenge where the Fed might have to choose between boosting growth and tamping down prices.

Markets have been nervous in recent weeks about the prospects ahead. Bond expert Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital told CNBC a few days ago that he sees the chances of a recession at 50% to 60%.

""The recent equity market correction was punctuated by the 'uncertainty shock' of ever-evolving tariff policy, with investors concerned it could morph into a slowdown or even recession,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday. ""What's really at the heart of the conundrum, however, is that the U.S. might be at risk for a bout of stagflation, where growth slows and inflation remains sticky.""

Powell, however, doubted that a repeat of the previous bout of stagnation is in the cards. ""I wouldn't say we're in a situation that's remotely comparable to that is likely,"" he said.

Barclays analysts noted that ""market-based measures are consistent with only a modest slowing in the economy,"" though the firm expects a growth rate this year of just 0.7%, barely above the recession threshold.

UCLA Anderson, a closely watched and widely cited forecasting center, recently turned heads with its first-ever ""recession watch"" call for the economy, based largely on concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Clement Bohr, an economist at the school, wrote that the downturn could come in a year or two though he said one is ""entirely avoidable"" should Trump scale back his tariff threats.

""This Watch also serves as a warning to the current administration: be careful what you wish for because, if all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession. And it may not simply be a standard recession that is being chaperoned into existence, but a stagflation,"" Bohr said.

"Tax revenue collected by the IRS set to plummet, report says","Officials at the IRS and Treasury Department are anticipating tax revenue to drop more than 10% by April 15 compared with last year, The Washington Post reported Saturday, citing three people with knowledge of the situation.

The loss of tax receipts is expected as more individuals and businesses don't file taxes or attempt to avoid paying balances owed to the IRS. The amount of lost federal revenue could top $500 billion, the paper said.

Officials said the prediction is directly linked to shifting taxpayer behavior and President Donald Trump's cuts at the IRS, the Post said.

Thousands are expected to lose their jobs at the agency as part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency spending reductions. Experts have warned that the cuts during tax season could materially impact filers.

The IRS has also noted increased chatter online from people saying they won't pay taxes this year or will make aggressive claims they aren't eligible for in a gamble that they won't be audited, the Post reported.

The Treasury Department told the paper the story was ""sensational and baseless"" and said the anonymous sources ""should be dismissed out of hand.""

Investors' optimism is growing around the UK economy as U.S.-EU trade disputes mount,"watch now

""Talk of a U.S. trade deal also surfaced in client conversations, and there was increased optimism that the U.K. may be spared from direct and widespread tariffs,"" Raja said. Some felt ""structural growth could be on the rise after a steady decline since the global financial crisis,"" he continued, while a broad European push to increase national defense spending could benefit U.K. corporates. Points of concern for investors remained January's sell-off in U.K. government debt, fiscal headroom and the sustainability of spending cuts, Raja observed.

Still trade risks

The U.K. may have been spared the worst of Trump's rhetoric so far — such as his threat of 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports — but it is not totally immune from Washington's protectionist push. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at AXA Investment Managers, noted that the U.K. still faces a hit due to the new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. The U.K. exported a total of £370 million ($479.7 million) in steel to the U.S. in 2024, according to trade group UK Steel, accounting for 9% of total U.K. steel exports by value. Britain's aluminum exports to the U.S. totaled were valued at around £225 million last year, the U.K.'s Aluminium Federation says. The U.K. will also be impacted by any slowdown in global trade, including if this leads to weaker demand in its key partners such as the EU, and if general uncertainty erodes business and consumer confidence, Dickens told CNBC. ""Investor sentiment may be boosted if the U.K. manages to avoid further tariffs, particularly if trade tensions ramp up with the EU,"" Dickens said. In the unlikely event Trump follows through with his prior threat of blanket 25% tariffs on the EU, a ""material boost"" would be provided to the U.K. as manufacturers would likely look to relocate, she said.",2025-03-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/optimism-is-growing-around-the-uk-economy-amid-us-eu-trade-disputes.html,cnbc
Chicago Fed President Goolsbee sees rate cuts depending on inflation progress,"Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said Friday he still sees interest rate cuts in the cards though risks are rising to that outlook.

Speaking two days after he and his colleagues again voted to keep short-term rates steady, Goolsbee told CNBC that he's been hearing more concerns from businesses in his region about the impact of tariffs and their potential to raise prices and slow growth.

""When you got a lot of uncertainty, I do think you need to wait to see some of these things get cleared up on the policy side,"" the central banker said during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""I'm out talking to business people and civic leaders throughout this region, and there's been a decided turn in these conversations over the last six weeks, of anxiety, of pausing, waiting on capital projects, capex, etc., until they figure out tariffs, other fiscal policy.""

Nevertheless, Goolsbee said he still expects future rate cuts even if the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach for now as issues play out over President Donald Trump's tariff plans as well as deregulation and tax cuts.

""If we can continue to make progress on inflation over the long run, I believe that rates 12 to 18 months from now will be lower than where they are today,"" he said.

Speaking separately Friday morning, New York Fed President John Williams also noted the high level of uncertainty around decision-making and economic trends, particularly inflation.

""Recent data — both hard and soft — are sending mixed signals. Measures of policy uncertainty have increased sharply in recent months,"" Williams said during a speech in Nassau, the Bahamas.

Both policymakers voted with the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee to hold the short-term fed funds rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC noted that ""uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased"" and Chair Jerome Powell used the term ""uncertainty"" 10 times in his post-meeting news conference.

One question that has come up in recent days has been whether the U.S. economy is headed toward stagflation, or slow growth and rising inflation.

""Tariffs, raise prices and reduce output. So that's a stagflationary impulse, which is different from saying this is stagflation,"" Goolsbee said. ""The unemployment rate is barely 4% and inflation is in the 2s. So the hard data that we start from is not the stagflation of the 1970s. It's just the ... the uncomfortable environment is when it's moving directionally the wrong way.""

FOMC meeting participants kept their projections for two rate cuts through 2025. Markets, though, think the Fed will be more aggressive, pricing in the equivalent of three quarter percentage point reductions, according to CME Group data.",2025-03-21 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/chicago-fed-president-goolsbee-sees-rate-cuts-depending-on-inflation-progress.html,cnbc
Accenture is DOGE's first corporate casualty as shares dive on warning that contracts will be cut,"Shares of Accenture slid Thursday after the consulting firm said efforts to tighten federal spending have begun to weigh on its revenues.

Shares tumbled 7.3% after Accenture's chief executive officer said in a fiscal second-quarter earnings call that the company's Federal Services business has lost contracts with the U.S. government after recent reviews.

""Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY 2024. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,"" chief executive Julie Spellman Sweet said in the Thursday call to several Wall Street analysts.

Accenture is among the first of the U.S. corporate giants to get hit by the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, an effort headed by billionaire Elon Musk to downsize federal agencies and consolidate their office spaces.

Sweet said that Accenture's Federal Services was also affected by guidance from the U.S. General Services Administration to all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest paid consulting firms contracting with the U.S. government, and then end contracts that are not considered mission-critical to relevant agencies.

""While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government's priorities evolve and these assessments unfold,"" Sweet said.

""We are seeing an elevated level of what was already a significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY 2025 earnings report in December,"" Sweet added. ""At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong.""

Investors' concerns about risks tied to slowing U.S. government spending outweighed Accenture's better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue results released before Thursday's market open. The company reported earnings of $2.82 per share on revenue of $16.66 billion, just higher than expectations of $2.81 per share in earnings on revenue of $16.62 billion, per FactSet.

Accenture shares have plunged 22.9% over the past month, bringing the stock down nearly 14.5% year to date.

"U.S. households are running out of emergency funds as pandemic cash runs out, inflation takes its toll","Vithun Khamsong | Moment | Getty Images

It is becoming harder for Americans to raise funds in case of an emergency, according to a recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve. The bank's Survey of Consumer Expectations for February found that the average likelihood of Americans being able to come up with $2,000 within a month if an unexpected need arose hit 62.7%. That's the lowest level since the survey began tracking the data point in October 2015. ""Taking into account that the CPI [consumer price index] level today is 35% higher than in 2015, the situation is even worse,"" said Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo.

While the latest CPI data for February showed prices moved up less than expected, there are concerns about the impact of Trump administration tariffs on the economy. Economic projections by the Federal Reserve suggest officials expect inflation to move higher this year more rapidly than previously expected. ""Inflation has started to move up now. We think partly in response to tariffs and there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference Wednesday. However, Powell said he doesn't expect the levies to have a long-lasting effect.

Trump says the Fed should cut rates to ease the economy’s transition to his tariffs,"U.S. President Donald Trump reacts as he meets NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte (not pictured), in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 13, 2025.

After largely staying out of the Federal Reserve's business during his first two months in office, President Donald Trump is pushing the central bank to cut interest rates as a backstop for his tariff plans.

In a post Wednesday night on Truth Social, Trump encouraged Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease policy as the administration enters the next phase of its aggressive trade policy.

""The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,"" Trump wrote. ""Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!""

The missive appeared just hours after the Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its key interest rate steady but indicated that two rate reductions are likely by the end of the year, assuming the quarter percentage point increments that policymakers prefer.

The April 2 reference is to when the administration will reveal the results of a study into global trade, likely resulting in further tariffs in an effort to level what it considers an unfair playing field.

At his post-meeting news conference, Powell addressed the tariff issue multiple times, largely reiterating the uncertain impact they could have as justifying the Fed's cautious current stance. In addition, Powell indicated that the duties could raise inflation in the short run but the impacts then would recede over time.

""I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out,"" he said.

Lower rates, however, could combine with tariffs to stir more inflation. Markets expect the Fed will wait until June before cutting. Fed rate reductions also don't always feed directly into lower borrowing rates. In the best-case scenario, lower rates would help buttress rising prices that are expected to come from the levies.

In contrast to his first term in office, Trump had thus far taken a mostly hands-off approach to Fed policymaking, aside from a few comments he made shortly after taking office also coaxing the central bank to lower rates. Trump in January said he would ""demand that interest rates drop immediately,"" though he didn't follow through on the threat.

In fact, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that the White House is more focused on bringing down the 10-year Treasury yield to lower long-term borrowing costs than it is on the short-term federal funds rate that the Fed controls.

Trump berated Powell and the Fed the last time around for raising rates, at one point calling them ""boneheads"" and comparing the chair to a golfer who couldn't putt.

Fed projections Wednesday indicated a full percentage point of cuts over the next three years for the funds rate, which is currently targeted between 4.25%-4.5%.",2025-03-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/trump-says-the-fed-should-cut-rates-to-ease-the-economys-transition-to-his-tariffs.html,cnbc
'Transitory' is back as the Fed doesn't expect tariffs to have long-lasting inflation impacts,"The ""good ship Transitory,"" despite an ominous record, appears ready to sail again for the Federal Reserve.

Economic projections the central bank released Wednesday indicate that while officials see inflation moving up this year more rapidly than previously expected, they also expect the trend to be short-lived. The outlook spurred talk again about ""transitory"" inflation that caused a major policy headache for the Fed.

At his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said the current outlook is that any price jumps from tariffs likely will be short-lived.

Asked if the Fed is ""back at transitory again,"" the central bank leader responded: ""So I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out.""

However, the Federal Open Market Committee outlook, with inflation hitting 2.8% in 2025 but quickly receding back to 2.2% then 2% in the succeeding years, indicates that officials do not expect a lasting burden from the tariffs.

""It can be the case that it's appropriate sometimes to look through inflation, if it's going to go away quickly, without action by us, if it's transitory,"" Powell said. ""That can be the case in the case of tariff inflation. I think that would depend on the tariff inflation moving through fairly quickly and, critically, as well on inflation expectations being well anchored.""

Powell added that while sentiment surveys show some short-term inflation indicators have risen, market-based measures for longer-run expectations are well anchored.",2025-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/transitory-is-back-as-the-fed-doesnt-expect-tariffs-to-have-long-lasting-inflation-impacts.html,cnbc
Bank of America's CEO says economic growth is 'better than people think' and the Fed should stay on hold,"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Wednesday that consumers are continuing to spend and economic growth should be solid though slower this year.

Despite surveys indicating that confidence is at a nearly three-year low amid increasing worries about inflation, Moynihan told CNBC that spending data shows consumers are still shelling out money, though shifting away from goods and into services.

""We're in this classic moment ... where the consumer is saying, 'I'm getting more pessimistic,' in some of the surveys and things like that,"" he said during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""But if you actually look what they're doing day to day, they continue to spend, which means the economy ought to be holding up better than people think.""

From a numbers standpoint, that means gross domestic product growth this year of closer to 2% from recent trends closer to 3%, according to the banking chief. Some of the slowdown will come from President Donald Trump's tariffs, which Moynihan estimated will cut about 0.4 percentage point off growth in the near term before the economy adjusts.

However, he called the 2% level ""trend growth. That's what we've all been trying to get to for 10 or 15 years after the financial crisis.""

""We see the consumer continue to be solid, and that should bode well for the economy,"" Moynihan added. ""There's a lot of questions out there, and I think that will sort through. But right now, we're not talking about what could happen, we're talking about is happening. The consumer continues to spend pretty strongly for the first part of this year.""",2025-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/bank-of-americas-ceo-says-economic-growth-is-better-than-people-think-and-the-fed-should-stay-on-hold.html,cnbc
Bank of England expected to keep rates on hold amid headwinds it can't fully predict or control,"The Bank of England in London on Feb. 12, 2024. Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty Images

The Bank of England is widely expected to hold interest rates when it meets on Thursday, as the U.K. faces economic headwinds both at home and abroad. The central bank is highly likely to keep its benchmark interest rate at 4.5% at its March meeting, given the unpredictability of President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and a fledgling global trade war, and how those factors could affect inflation in the U.K. The BOE is also convening as the U.K economy shows signs of stalling, with monthly growth data showing anemic output. Thursday's meeting comes just days before U.K. government taxation changes come into force that have proven unpopular with businesses, which say their rising tax burden could dent growth, investment and jobs. For its part, the Bank of England already warned at its last meeting in February that it would tread carefully, as it downgraded the U.K.'s growth forecast for 2025 and predicted a temporary rise in the rate of inflation to 3.7% — above the bank's target of 2% — which BOE policymakers said would be caused by higher energy prices. As for Trump's tariffs, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned earlier in March that potential trade duties were another threat to the country's economy, and growth, telling British lawmakers that ""the risks to the U.K. economy, and indeed the world economy, are substantial"" and that U.K. citizens would have less money ""in their pockets"" as a result of tariffs.

Dissent in the committee

In February, a majority of seven members out of the nine-strong monetary policy committee voted in favor of a cut, with two of the MPC's members, including well-known ""hawk"" Catherine Mann, voting for a larger trim. Economists say the voting split of Thursday will be closely watched. ""There are visible signs of disagreement at the Bank of England on the pace of rate cuts required this year. But with wage growth and inflation remaining sticky, we expect the Bank to keep rates on hold this Thursday, ahead of the next rate cut in May,"" James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, said in a note Monday.

""Drama is not often synonymous with the Bank of England. But February's meeting was nothing short of a bombshell. [BOE committee member] Catherine Mann, who for months had led the opposition to rate cuts, surprised everyone with her vote for a 50 basis point rate cut. And that posed the question: if the arch-hawk is prepared to vote for faster rate cuts, will the rest of the committee soon follow suit?,"" Smith questioned. ""For all the excitement, the answer seems to be no. Most officials that have spoken since have struck a much more cautious tone,"" he noted, with ING predicting three more rate cuts will take place this year. It nevertheless conceded that inflationary pressures are putting the central bank in an ""uncomfortable position.""

Budget changes?

The BoE is meeting days before the U.K. Treasury's ""Spring Statement"" on March 26, when British Chancellor Rachel Reeves presents an update on her plans for the British economy. The finance minister is coming under pressure to cut public spending, raise taxes further or to bend the government's self-imposed fiscal rules amid higher borrowing costs, with the yield on U.K. debt picking up in recent months. The treasury has mooted the idea of cutting spending on welfare payments, but the idea remains controversial among lawmakers in the center-left Labour government. Reeves' 'Spring Statement' will be announced alongside economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the U.K.'s independent economic and fiscal forecaster, which gives its assessment on the likely impact of the government's taxation and spending plans that were announced last fall. That budget included £40 billion ($51.9 billion) worth of tax rises — with the burden falling mainly on businesses — to plug a black hole in the public finances and allow for investment in public services.

"Trump policies 'promise' an economic downturn, says prominent forecaster in first-ever 'recession watch'","U.S. Vice President JD Vance (C) exits the Oval Office in the opposite direction as U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk (R) walk away before departing the White House on March 14, 2025.

The UCLA Anderson Forecast, citing substantial changes to the economy from policies of the Trump administration, issued its first-ever ""recession watch"" on Tuesday.

UCLA Anderson, which has been issuing forecasts since 1952, said the administration's tariff and immigration policies and plans to reduce the federal workforce could combine to cause the economy to contract.

Its analysis was titled, ""Trump Policies, If Fully Enacted, Promise a Recession.""

""While there are no signs of a recession happening yet, it is entirely possible that one could form in the near term,"" said a news release from the forecaster.

U.S. recessions are only officially declared by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research. The committee employs a variety of indicators, including production, employment, income and growth to determine if the economy is contracting. At the moment, none of the specific indicators look to be near levels that would prompt the committee to declare recession.

The average respondent to the CNBC Fed Survey for March, published Tuesday, forecast a 36% recession probability in the next year, up from 23% in the prior month. But it remains well below the 50% level that prevailed from 2022 and 2023 in the wake of the pandemic and turned out to be wrong. That shows how difficult it is to predict a recession, or even determine if the economy is in one. The Fed Survey also shows that a recession is not the base case for most Wall Street forecasters, only that the concern is somewhat elevated.

Recessions occur when multiple sectors of the economy contract at the same time. The UCLA Anderson Forecast said reductions to the workforce from the administration's immigration policies could create labor shortages, tariffs will raise prices and could lead to a contraction in the manufacturing sector while changes to federal spending will reduce employment for government workers and private contractors.

""If these and their consequent feedback into the demand for goods and services occur simultaneously, they create a recipe for a recession,"" the statement from the forecaster said.",2025-03-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/trump-policies-promise-an-economic-downturn-says-prominent-forecaster-in-first-ever-recession-watch.html,cnbc
The Fed will update its rate projections Wednesday. Here's what to expect,"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on ""The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,"" at Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., Feb. 11, 2025.

Federal Reserve officials at this week's meeting are expected to hold interest rates steady but adjust their views on the economy and possibly the future path for interest rates.

If market pricing is correct, there's virtually no chance central bank policymakers budge from the current level of their key interest rate, targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%. Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues in recent weeks have advocated a patient approach in which they don't need to be in a hurry to do anything.

However, they are also expected to drop clues about where things go from here against the uncertain backdrop of President Donald Trump's trade and fiscal policies. That could include anything from tweaks in projections for inflation and economic growth to how often, if at all, they expect to lower interest rates further.

""There's no chance of a cut Wednesday, so all the other stuff becomes more important,"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. ""They're basically going to say, 'You know what, we are in no hurry at all now.'""

Indeed, that has been the prevailing message from Powell and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues. In a speech earlier this month to economists in New York, Powell insisted ""there is no need to be in a hurry"" as central bankers seek ""greater clarity"" on where the Trump administration is headed.

New outlook for GDP, inflation, unemployment

The public, then, will be left to pore through updates the Fed makes to its quarterly projections on interest rates, gross domestic product, unemployment and inflation. Based on recent data, the Fed could raise its 2025 outlook for inflation (in December, the outlook was for 2.5% in both core and headline) while lowering its GDP projection (from 2.1%). Powell will host his usual post-meeting news conference.

On the rate question, the Federal Open Market Committee will use its ""dot plot"" grid of individual members' intentions.

There's significant disagreement on what could happen there. The committee could maintain its December outlook for two cuts, remove one or both, or, improbably, add another as a statement of concern over a potential slowdown. Everything seems to be on the table.",2025-03-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/the-fed-will-update-its-rate-projections-wednesday-what-to-expect.html,cnbc
"Retail sales increased 0.2% in February, though spending up less than expected","Consumers spent at a slower-than-expected pace in February, though underlying readings indicated that sales still grew at a solid pace despite worries over an economic slowdown and rising inflation.

Retail sales increased 0.2% on the month, better than the downwardly revised decline of 1.2% the prior month but below the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.6% rise, according to the advanced reading Monday from the Commerce Department. Excluding autos, the increase was 0.3%, in line with expectations.

The sales number is adjusted for seasonal factors but not for inflation. Prices rose 0.2% on the month, according to a previous Labor Department report, indicating that spending was about on pace with inflation.

The so-called control group, which strips out noncore sectors and feeds directly into gross domestic product calculations, rose a better-than-expected 1%.

Stocks, which hit correction levels last week, were higher following the report. Longer-dated Treasury yields rose slightly.

""Not a great report, but one still in positive territory despite how pessimistic consumers are about the future,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""But the main factor in consumer spending is consumer income, and that's growing at a good rate and had an impressive leap in January.""

Online spending helped boost the sales number for the month, with nonstore retailers reporting a 2.4% increase. Health and personal care showed a 1.7% gain while food and beverage outlets saw a 0.4% rise.

On the downside, bars and restaurants reported a 1.5% decrease, while gas stations were off 1% amid falling prices at the pump.

Sales overall increased 3.1% on a year-over-year basis, better than the 2.8% inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index.

One other downbeat note from the report was a steep revision for January, which originally was reported as a 0.9% decline.

The release comes amid heightened worries over economic growth, particularly as President Donald Trump engages in an aggressive tariff battle with leading U.S. trading partners. Economists worry that the tariffs will drive up inflation and slow the economy.

""Consumers and businesses are expected to pull back on spending when they're unable to make informed decisions about the future of the economy and their place within it,"" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at personal finance site NerdWallet. ""Currently, direct economic policies and broad federal policies with indirect economic impact are in flux, making informed decisions difficult.""

Some indicators, such as the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracker of economic data, are showing that growth could be negative in the first quarter, though the solid reading for control retail sales could result in an upward revision later Monday.

In other economic news Monday, the New York Fed's measure of factory activity in the region posted an unexpectedly sharp drop for March.

The Empire State Manufacturing Survey posted a reading of -20 for the month, representing the difference between companies seeing expansion against contraction. The number indicated a drop from the 5.7 level in February and was well below the estimate for -1.8.

New orders posted a sharp slide, with the index tumbling to -14.9, down 26.3 points. Shipments also were off significantly. On inflation, indexes for prices paid and received also rose.

U.S. and global economic outlooks cut by OECD as Trump's trade tariffs weigh on growth,"Both U.S. and global economic growth is set to be lower than previously projected as President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. weigh on growth, according to the latest estimates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

""Global GDP growth is projected to moderate from 3.2% in 2024, to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026, with higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty weighing on investment and household spending,"" the OECD said Monday in its interim Economic Outlook report.

""Annual GDP growth in the United States is projected to slow from its strong recent pace, to be 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.""

In its previous projections, published in December, the OECD had estimated 3.3% global economic growth this year and next. The U.S. economy had been expected to grow 2.4% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026.

Mathias Cormann, secretary-general of the OECD, on Monday said that the uncertainty around trade policy was a key factor in the organization's projections.

""There's a very significant level of uncertainty right now, and you know it is clear that the global economy would benefit from increases in certainty when it comes to the trade policy settings,"" he told CNBC's Silvia Amaro.

In its report, the OECD said its latest projections were ""based on an assumption that bilateral tariffs between Canada and the United States and between Mexico and the United States are raised by an additional 25 percentage points on almost all merchandise imports from April.""

Treasury Secretary Bessent says White House is heading off a 'guaranteed' financial crisis,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters outside the West Wing after doing a television interview on the North Lawn of the White House on March 13, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the Trump administration is focused on preventing a financial crisis that could be the result of massive government spending over the past few years.

""What I could guarantee is we would have had a financial crisis. I've studied it, I've taught it, and if we had kept up at these spending levels that -- everything was unsustainable,"" Bessent said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

President Donald Trump has made getting the government's fiscal house in order a priority since taking office. He created the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, to spearhead job cuts and early retirement incentives across multiple federal agencies.

Still, the U.S. debt and deficit problem worsened during Trump's first month in office, as the budget shortfall for February passed the $1 trillion mark.

Bessent noted that there are ""no guarantees"" there won't be a recession.

The market has been on a tumultuous ride as of late as Trump's widespread tariffs raised concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. The S&P 500 on Thursday fell into a 10% correction from its February high as volatility spiked.

Bessent believes pullbacks like the one the market is in right now are benign, and Trump's pro-business policies will boost the market and the economy over the long run.

""I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal,"" he said. ""What's not healthy is straight up, that you get these euphoric markets. That's how you get a financial crisis. It would have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes on in '06, '07. We wouldn't have had the problems in '08.""

""I'm not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great,"" Bessent added.

'See you in four years': Canada flexes economic muscle as tariff negotiations continue,"A ""Shop Canadian"" sign is seen at the entrance of a supermarket in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, March 4, 2025. Liang Seng | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images

Canadians are swapping their friendly auras for a fierce sense of nationalism amid U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on the country's trade and sovereignty. Trump's mostly delayed plans for 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and his calls for the country to become an American state has incensed citizens of the U.S.' northern neighbor and key trade partner. As a result, Canadians have rejected American imports and issued other economic punishments in an unusual show of patriotism. ""It really feels for most Canadians like we've been backstabbed, that the person that we trusted the most is now sort of turning on us and attacking us for no apparent reason,"" said Joel Bilt, an economics professor focused on international trade at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. ""That has really unified people."" Grocery stores have encouraged visitors to ""shop Canadian"" with signs and special labels in aisles alerting them to which products were made domestically. A popular Facebook group focused on buying Canadian-made goods first reported on by NBC News has seen its membership more than double since early February as the on-again, off-again tariff policy played out.

More than 60% of Canadians reported buying fewer American products when shopping either in store or online, according to a survey from market research firm Leger of more than 1,500 residents conducted between March 7 and March 10. Just over 7 out of 10 said they upped their purchases of goods made within the country, which has the ninth-largest economy in the world. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario went even further, barring its members from ordering American alcohol. Because the LCBO sells upward of $1 billion in American liquor each year, the move has raised alarm for U.S.-based spirit makers like Jack Daniel's parent Brown-Forman . ""That's worse than a tariff,"" said Lawson Whiting, chief executive of Brown-Forman, on the Kentucky-based company's earnings call this month. ""It's literally taking your sales away.""

Ontario also said it would implement a 25% surcharge on electricity exported to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. But Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that he would temporarily halt this tax after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick agreed to restart negotiations. Trump initially responded by calling to raise tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%, but the White House told CNBC that he backed down following the conversation between Lutnick and Ford. Still, Trump's now-withdrawn plan for higher taxes on the metals put the United Steelworkers union — which represents about 850,000 people in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean — on alert. USW International President David McCall said in a March 11 statement that the North American arms of the international trade organization would ""fight together"" against the proposed levies, which he said threatens jobs on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border.

A 'pushback'

Even as the tariff negotiations remain in flux, travel to the U.S. is already taking a hit. Return trips by Canadians from the U.S. by vehicle tumbled around 23% in February from the same month a year ago, according to government statistics.

Government data also showed the number of Canadians flying back into the country from international locations declined in February from a year ago, signaling a pullback in tourism abroad. That comes as Air Canada announced plans to cut capacity to warm U.S. locations like Florida, Arizona and Nevada beginning this month. Trump's threats have prompted some cancellations to the Wildwoods in New Jersey, a popular beach destination for travelers from places like Montreal and Quebec, according to Ben Rose, marketing and public relations director at the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Authority. But he said these rescissions haven't been as widespread as initially expected. Canadians are also weighing concerns around the exchange rate, he added.

At consumer travel shows in Toronto and Montreal, the authority received some comments from potential Canadian travelers about how Trump's plan for levies has deterred vacationing in America. Rose said his team reminds uneasy Canadians that it has been a welcoming destination for them over several decades and provides unique value as a location within driving distance. ""Some of the pushback we've been getting is that: 'You know we love Americans, and we know they love us, but we'll see you in four years,'"" Rose said. ""They can't go along with the administration.""

Political, cultural efforts

Canadians' stance against Trump's policies has spilled into culture and media as the issue captured the country's interest. Canadians booed the U.S. national anthem before major league sporting games against American teams. During an appearance on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" this month, Canadian celebrity Mike Myers donned a shirt that reads ""Canada is not for sale"" alongside the country's red-and-white flag.

Trump’s Canadian tariffs are having a chilling effect on Vermont’s small business owners,"Ryan Christiansen, president and head distiller at Caledonia Spirits, giving a tour in Montpelier, VT. Courtesy: Ryan Christianse | Caledonia Spirits

President Donald Trump's tariff rhetoric against Canada has only started to heat up, but Vermont's small businesses are already feeling some pain. A shipment of spirits, ordered by the Société des alcools du Québec – an entity that's responsible for the trade of alcoholic beverages in the province – has been sitting on a shipping dock at Montpelier-based Barr Hill by Caledonia Spirits for about a month. The SAQ called off the order shortly after Trump announced the tariffs against Canada in February, according to Ryan Christiansen, president and head distiller at Caledonia Spirits. ""Customers are ready to buy, and we are in the peak of slow season – it's an annual cycle for us, and we were looking forward to shipping the order. Now, it's sitting on the dock,"" he said. ""To have this hit our business in the slow month of February? We missed our financial plan in February because of this.""

Vermont has a special relationship with Canada, as the Green Mountain State exports $680 million in goods to the U.S.'s northern neighbor annually, according to data compiled by Connect2Canada. Vermont imports more than $2.6 billion in goods from Canada each year, with electricity and fuel oil among the top imported goods. Because of the state's close business ties to Canada and their shared borders, small businesses in Vermont began seeing some fallout as early as February – when Trump first announced a round of 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, triggering 25% retaliatory levies from then-Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. At the time, Ontario also said it would pull American alcohol products from its shelves. Ultimately, Trump granted a reprieve on Canadian and Mexican goods covered by the North American trade agreement USMCA until April 2. However, many products are still subject to the duties. ""We worked really hard to maintain this relationship with the Canadian government,"" Christiansen said. ""How do I get them to buy as much as the Canadian customer wanted to buy? Even if the tariffs go away, I think it's overly optimistic that this order gets resubmitted."" Tourism worries It didn't take long for Steve Wright, president and general manager of Jay Peak Resort, which is about 10 miles from the Canadian border, to begin seeing the impact of the rhetoric around tariffs. He noted that spending from Canadian tourists showed signs of softening particularly in two key weeks: Quebec break week, which ran from March 3 to March 8, and Ontario break week, which kicked off on March 10. Though Canadian visitors generally account for about half of the resort's market, they make up virtually all of it during that two-week stretch, Wright said.

Consumer sentiment slumps in March to lowest since 2022 as Trump tariffs spark more inflation worries,"Consumer sentiment took another hit in March as worries intensified over inflation and a slumping stock market, according to the University of Michigan's latest sentiment survey released Friday.

The survey posted a mid-month reading of 57.9, which represents a 10.5% decline from February and was below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 63.2. The reading was 27.1% below a year ago and was the lowest since November 2022.

While the current conditions index fell a less severe 3.3%, the expectations measure for the future was off 15.3% on a monthly basis and 30% from the same period in 2024.

In addition, fears grew over where inflation is headed as President Donald Trump institutes tariffs against U.S. trading partners. New duties on aluminum and steel took effect Wednesday, and the president this week also threatened 200% tariffs on European Union liquor after the EU hit U.S. whiskey and other goods with 50% levies.

The one-year outlook spiked to 4.9%, up 0.6 percentage point from February and the highest reading since November 2022. At the five-year horizon, the outlook jumped to 3.9%, up 0.4 percentage point for the highest level since February 1993.

Stocks largely brushed off the report, holding in positive territory while Treasury yields moved higher.

Though the measure is often prone to disparities between parties, survey officials said sentiment slumped across partisan lines along with virtually all demographics.

""Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one's policy preferences,"" Joanne Hsu, the survey's director, said. ""Consumers from all three political affiliations are in agreement that the outlook has weakened since February.""

Expectations fell 10% for Republicans, 24% for Democrats and 12% for independents, Hsu added. Sentiment overall has fallen 22% since December.

The inflation outlook contradicts reports earlier this week showing that consumer prices rose less than expected while wholesale prices were flat in February.

Markets largely expect the Federal Reserve, which aims for a 2% inflation rate, to stay on hold when it concludes its two-day meeting Wednesday. Traders, though, are pricing in 0.75 percentage point of interest rate cuts by the end of the year, starting in June, according to the CME Group's gauge of futures pricing.

Why this week's positive inflation reports won't look as good to the Fed,"Watermelons from Mexico are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on March 5, 2025 in Novato, California.

Markets agree, at least for now. Traders are assigning virtually no probability of a cut at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and only about a 1-in-4 chance of a reduction in May, according to CME Group calculations .

""In short, progress on inflation has started off 2025 on the wrong foot,"" Bank of America economist Stephen Juneau said in a note. ""Our forecast for PCE inflation reinforces our view that inflation is unlikely to fall enough for the Fed to cut this year, especially given policy changes that boost inflation. We maintain our view that policy rates will stay on hold through year-end unless activity data really weakens.""

Because of some byzantine math and trends in a few key areas beneath the headline readings, policymakers are unlikely to take a lot of comfort in these numbers, according to multiple Wall Street economists.

While the consumer and producer price indexes both were lower than anticipated, that won't necessarily be reflected in the main measure the Fed uses to gauge inflation.

On the surface, February's inflation data released this week brought some encouraging news. But underneath, there were signs likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it comes to interest rates.

While the Fed pays attention to the two Bureau of Labor Statistics gauges, it considers the last word on inflation to be the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index.

Central bank officials believe the PCE reading — in particular the core that excludes food and energy prices — to be a broader look at price trends. The index also more closely reflects what consumers are buying rather than just the prices of individual goods and services. If consumers are, say, substituting chicken for beef, that would be more indicated in the PCE rather than the CPI or PPI.

Most economists think the latest PCE reading, scheduled for release later this month, will show the year-over-year inflation rate at best holding steady at 2.6% or perhaps even ticking up a notch — further away from the Fed's 2% goal.

Specifically, Thursday's PPI report, which measures wholesale costs and is thus considered an indicator of pipeline inflation, ""confirms our fears that the benign February inflation print would map across to a hotter than expected inflation print on the Fed's preferred PCE inflation gauge,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.

""Rather than decline steadily through early [second quarter], PCE inflation looks instead set to be bumpy and choppy,"" he added.

Some of the areas that will feed through from the PPI and elevate the PCE include higher prices for hospital care as well as insurance prices and air transportation, according to Sam Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

""The outturn almost certainly will make the Fed wince,"" Combs wrote.

Combs predicts the core PCE reading for February will show an inflation rate of 2.8%, a 0.2 percentage point increase from January. That's about in line with others on the Street, as Bank of America and Citigroup see the core inflation rate at 2.7%. Either way, it's moving in the wrong direction. The consumer price index showed a core inflation rate of 3.1%, the lowest since April 2021.

However, there could be some good news yet.

As much as the expectation is for a bounce from February, many forecasters see inflation pulling back beyond that, even with the impact from tariffs.

Citi thinks March will see a ""much more favorable"" reading, with the firm predicting an out-of-consensus call of the Fed resuming its rate cuts in May. Market pricing currently indicates a much greater likelihood of a June cut.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/why-this-weeks-positive-inflation-reports-wont-look-as-good-to-the-fed.html,cnbc
"Tariffs to add as much as $10,000 to the cost of the average new home, trade association says","President Donald Trump's tariffs could increase material costs for the average new home by as much as $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

The trade group said it has received anecdotal reports from members that Trump's plan for levies would raise material prices by between $7,500 and $10,000 for the average new single-family home. While the association is planning a formal survey in the future, this figure offers an early glimpse of what businesses and consumers can expect if Trump's controversial taxes on Canadian and Mexican imports go forward as planned.

""For years, NAHB has been leading the fight against tariffs because of their detrimental effect on housing affordability,"" the association wrote in a blog post published last week. ""In effect, the tariffs act as a tax on American builders, home buyers and consumers.""

Trump last week delayed 25% tariffs for some Canadian and Mexican imports by a month after implementing them just days earlier, a stunning reversal amid financial market turmoil. His additional hike to levies on China, which lifted duties on that nation's goods to 20%, went forward.

The NAHB said softwood lumber is mainly sourced from Canada, while gypsum, a component of drywall, comes primarily from Mexico. Other materials like steel and aluminum — in addition to completed home appliances — are imported to the U.S. from China, the group said.

An implementation of the 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico as previously laid out by Trump would raise total costs for imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, according to the NAHB.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/tariffs-to-add-as-much-as-10000-to-average-cost-of-new-home-trade-group-says.html,cnbc
Treasury Secretary Bessent says a 'detox' period for the economy does not have to be a recession,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday that his previous comments about a ""detox period"" for the U.S. economy did not mean that a recession was necessary.

""Not at all. Doesn't have to be, because it will depend on how quickly the baton gets handed off. Our goal is to have a smooth transition,"" Bessent said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

The comments come after Bessent said Friday that the U.S. would undergo a transition period as the federal government tries to cut spending, including laying off public sector workers. Bessent on Thursday reiterated his view that current levels of government spending are ""unsustainable.""

""We have excess employment in the government, and those people can be moved to the private sector,"" Bessent said.

The Treasury head's comments last week came as several recent economic indicators have pointed to weakening growth. Job growth was slower than expected in February, and surveys of consumers and small business have shown a decline in confidence.

Egg prices are rapidly falling so far in March,"Chickens stand next to stacks of eggs in a henhouse at Sunrise Farms on February 18, 2025 in Petaluma, California.

Egg prices have fallen sharply so far in March on some progress in ending a shortage, giving consumers some much-needed relief with the supermarket staple.

The cost of white large shell eggs declined to $6.85 per dozen, on average, last week, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That represents a decline of $1.20 per dozen, and a 15% pull back the USDA's prior update on Feb. 28.

""Demand for shell eggs continues to fade into the new month as no significant outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] have been detected in nearly two weeks,"" the USDA wrote in its March 7 weekly update. ""This respite has provided an opportunity for production to make progress in reducing recent shell egg shortages.""

Egg prices have become a key pressure point for consumers that are tired of sticky inflation and worried about more potential price increases due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on a wide array of imports. While it is still unknown the full ramifications of the duties on Canada, China and Mexico, stocks have so far pulled back in 2025 on concern the moves could further raise prices of goods and tip a sagging economy into a recession.

To be sure, the price of eggs have still skyrocketed more than 170% from a year ago, USDA data shows. The rise has spurred an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into allegations of anticompetitive practices from some of the largest egg producers in the country. Firms including Cal-Maine Foods have touted a crushing avian flu outbreak, which has forced the culling of millions of egg-laying hens, as the major catalyst for the rise in egg prices.

""The primary reason for the drop is actions taken by the administration's Department of Justice to investigate the companies for possible antitrust violations,"" said Joe Maxwell, president of Farm Action Fund, told CNBC. ""The dominant firms have so much control over the market that they can increase prices and lower prices almost at will.""

""There has been a softening of demand for eggs by consumers, but we do not see this as a significant factor, considering this has been an ongoing trend,"" Maxwell added.

Egg prices were a key factor in the February consumer price index report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics noting prices advanced 10.4% last month and 58.8% year-over-year. The marked-up price tag for eggs has even pushed consumers to begin shifting their breakfast habits.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/egg-prices-are-rapidly-falling-so-far-in-march.html,cnbc
Treasury Secretary Bessent said the White House is focused on the 'real economy' and not concerned about 'a little' market volatility,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday the Trump administration is more focused on the long-term health of the economy and markets and not short-term gyrations.

""We're focused on the real economy. Can we create an environment where there are long-term gains in the market and long-term gains for the American people?"" Bessent said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks.""

The comments come with markets in a state of turmoil largely centered on President Donald Trump's near-daily moves on tariffs against major U.S. trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and China. Major averages have moved toward correction territory, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 7% over the past month.

While Bessent said the administration is attentive to market moves, he predicted that both the real economy and markets would prosper over time.

""The reason stocks are a safe and great investment is because you're looking over the long term. If you start looking at micro horizons, stocks become very risky. So we are focused over the medium-, long-term,"" he said in the interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen. ""I can tell you that if we put proper policies in place, it's going to lay the groundwork for a both real income gains and job gains and continued asset gains.""

Stocks again were volatile in morning trade, with the averages around even as Bessent spoke.

Earlier in the morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that wholesale inflation was flat in February, well below Wall Street expectations for a 0.3% increase. That followed a report Wednesday indicating that the consumer price rate had nudged lower as well, providing some welcome news amid concerns that the Trump tariffs would aggravate inflation.

""Maybe the inflation is getting under control and the market is going to have some confidence in that,"" Bessent said.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/treasury-secretary-bessent-said-the-white-house-is-focused-on-the-real-economy-and-not-concerned-about-a-little-market-volatility.html,cnbc
"U.S. tariffs could thrust Germany into recession, central bank governor says","The German parliament building, the Reichstag, which has been the seat of the Bundestag since 1999.

U.S. tariffs could push Europe's largest economy into a recession, German central bank President Joachim Nagel warned Thursday, as Berlin faces a debate over the potential overhaul of its fiscal policies.

""Now we are in a world with tariffs, so we could expect maybe a recession for this year, if the tariffs are really coming,"" Nagel, who leads the Bundesbank and serves as a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, said during a BBC podcast interview.

Global tariffs are set to exacerbate the existing symptoms of what Nagel described as Germany's ""stagnating economy,"" which has contracted for two consecutive years amid the combined aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crisis triggered by Western sanctions on Russia for its three-year invasion of Ukraine.

Mere months after inflation and interest rates began descending in the euro zone last year, returning U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff-heavy strategy, aimed at reducing his country's perceived deficits with trade partners, is rattling markets – and fracturing Europe's traditionally strong relationship with its transatlantic ally.

On Wednesday, the European Union retaliated against Trump's 25% duties on steel and aluminum imports that came into effect that day with a spate of counter-tariffs set to affect 26 billion euros ($28.26 billion) worth of U.S. goods, starting in April.

""This is not a good policy,"" Nagel said, bemoaning the ""tectonic changes"" now facing the world at large. ""I hope that there is understanding within the Trump administration that the price that has to be paid is the highest on the side of the Americans.""

As the world's third-largest exporter, according to 2023 data, and numbering the U.S. as the foremost importer of its goods, Germany is especially vulnerable to tariffs, which could erode its automative and machinery sectors.

Cripplingly, exports of good and services accounted for 43.4% of Germany's gross domestic product in 2023, according to World Bank data, although federal statistics office data indicate its typically high foreign trade surplus most recently slimmed to 16 billion euros in January, compared with 20.7 billion euros in December.

The tariffs-led uncertainty come at a time when the EU nations could be set to loosen their budgetary strings and accommodate additional defense expenses, under the bloc's 'ReArm' plan revealed last week amid uncertainty over the U.S.' ongoing commitment to assist Ukraine.

Fitch Ratings on Thursday warned that the initiative, which could mobilize close to 800 billion euros of defense expenditures, risks lowering the headroom of the EU's current AAA rating because of the additional debt likely to be undertaken, without leading to an outright downgrade.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/us-tariffs-could-thrust-germany-into-recession-ecbs-joachim-nagel.html,cnbc

Watch out for these stocks as April 2 tariffs approach,"The promised date for the White House's so-called reciprocal tariffs is no longer far off in the future. The Trump administration is expected to announce a wide-ranging tariff plan on April 2. While many of the tariffs announced so far have been pitched as temporary and aimed at specific countries, Trump has said the new reciprocal levies will be permanent and more widespread. That could lead to a larger economic impact for investors. ""The work from our economists suggests the growth impact of 60% tariffs on 75% of Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% tariffs on [rest of world] imports would equate to -0.5% GDP growth globally. Inflationary pressures would be variable, though predominantly impactful to the U.S.,"" UBS strategist Gerry Fowler said in a note to clients. The worry about tariffs has already taken a bite out of the stock market, but that doesn't mean all the effects are priced in. For example, inflation could become a bigger concern, especially after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in hotter than expected on Friday. ""On the expectations that the stagflationary pressure continues with rising credit and earnings risk premia, we expect U.S. equities to fall slightly (SPX -3%) but with hard assets (Gold Miners and Energy) outperforming others (like Financials),"" Fowler said. UBS also published a list of tariff-sensitive stocks in Fowler's note. Some of the stocks in the list also have a neutral rating from the firm, rather than a buy rating. That includes apparel stocks Nike and Crocs , each of which have a sizeable portion of their sales outside of North America, according to UBS.

"This fire retardant maker will benefit as 'wildfires wreak havoc around more populated areas,' says UBS","Perimeter Solutions stands to benefit as wildfires grow more frequent and threaten residential areas, as evidenced by the deadly blazes in Los Angeles earlier this year, according to UBS Securities. Analyst Joshua Spector upgraded shares of the Missouri-based fire retardant producer to buy from neutral. Spector's $14 price target implies shares can climb 54% over the next 12 months from Tuesday's close. ""We believe recent memory of L.A. wildfires will increase the call for more ability to fight, contain and prevent wildfires,"" Spector wrote to clients. ""This should catalyze growth in PRM's volumes, absent growth in acres burned, and provide more firepower to PRM's earnings algorithm."" ""[A]s wildfires wreak havoc around more populated areas (like L.A.), this could drive further demand to contain & prevent wildfires,"" the analyst wrote, even while acknowledging that the total number of acres scorched by wildfires has not grown much over time. But the total volume of fire retardant used from aircraft should rise given increased investment in drop planes, which require mobile bases for reloading that are owned by Perimeter. Preventative materials made by Perimeter will also see greater demand.

Bank of America double upgrades this mobile gaming stock after a big tumble,"Investors should snap up Playtika shares after a recent sell-off, according to Bank of America. Analyst Omar Dessouky issued a rare double upgrade to buy from underperform for the mobile gaming stock. Dessouky also lifted his price target by 50 cents to $6.50, which suggests shares of the stock can surge 47.7%. With the call, Dessouky stands out on Wall Street. The majority of analysts polled by LSEG have hold ratings. Dessouky pointed out that Playtika has the industry's highest profitability and biggest direct-to-consumer platform. The company, which operates brands such as Bingo Blitz and Caesars Slots, also has ""three of the largest and longest running franchises in mobile gaming history,"" according to the analyst. He said the stock is in an industry that is ""mature"" but ""still growing,"" with annual growth of at least 4% expected going forward. For Playtika in particular, he said further downside to shares is likely limited given the management's strong reputation. In other words, the stock is a ""nice house in (an) undesirable neighborhood on sale,"" Dessouky said to clients in a Wednesday note. The stock should see valuation upside if the growth strategy goes as planned, according to Dessouky. However, he cautioned that a lack of clarity around intentions from the largest shareholder creates risk for the dividend. Shares surged around 7% before the bell on Wednesday. However, the stock has tumbled more than 36% in 2025, part of a recent decline that Dessouky chalked up in part to concerns about a large investor exiting and traders preferring mobile ad network assets to publishers.

Wells Fargo says this restaurant stock is a buy after a sharp pullback,"Wells Fargo thinks investors should buy the dip on Wingstop — and the bank isn't referring to its ranch dressing. Analyst Zachary Fadem initiated coverage of the fast-casual chicken wing chain with an overweight rating. Fadem's $270 price target suggests shares can rally 22.7% from Tuesday's close. ""We view WING among the best-in-class consumer growth stories, w/ superior unit economics, consistent share gains, & arsenal of [long-term] growth drivers,"" Fadem wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. ""Hard compares complicate the [first-half] setup, but we see ample reasons for [same-store sales] to re-accelerate."" With this note, Fadem joins the majority of analysts polled by LSEG with buy-equivalent ratings on the stock. Fadem acknowledged a ""tough"" backdrop for the stock, given its weak comps for the first half of the year, growth-focused price-to-earnings multiple and near-term hurdles. Shares have plunged around 28% since the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. But Fadem said the stock should be able to re-rate on easier comparables for the second half, and he said there could be a ""snap back"" in the back half of the year. Wingstop also has a strong free cash flow profile and multiyear sales levers, he said. ""Stepping back, we view WING among the premium share takers in QSR & we see opportunity to own high quality growth while sentiment is poor,"" Fadem said, using a popular acronym for quick-service restaurants.

"Buy this health-care stock as it undergoes a 'transformation,' Morgan Stanley says","Investors have an opportunity to buy into Tenet Healthcare right now as the company evolves, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Craig Hettenbach initiated the health-care services stock with an overweight rating. Hettenbach's $165 price target implies 26.2% upside from Tuesday's close. Despite political uncertainty weighing on the stock, Hettenbach said the company should be boosted by a shift toward outpatient care and lower-cost services. ""A significant business model and balance sheet transformation has yet to be captured in THC's multiple,"" Hettenbach wrote to clients in a Wednesday note. ""Risks of government spending cuts likely remain an overhang near term, providing entry points for patient investors in what should emerge as a much cleaner story and durable business."" Specifically, the analyst said Tenet is expanding and leveraging its USPI business, which has ambulatory and surgical offerings. That is done in part through tuck-in acquisitions, he said. On top of that, Hettenbach said Tenet is a leader within the ambulatory surgery center space and is the ""largest provider in a fragmented market."" Due to that, he thinks the Texas-based company can see tailwinds. Elsewhere, Hettenbach said Tenet could pick up its pace for stock buybacks as free cash flow improves and the balance sheet grows stronger. Shares have climbed more than 3% in 2025, bucking the downtrend seen in the broad market this year.

These 100-bagger stocks are up the most in the past 25 years,"Almost 20 stocks have been on a massive tear in the quarter century since the dot-com bubble peaked 25 years ago, each one climbing at least 10,000%, counting as ""100 baggers,"" according to Bespoke Investment Group. The March 24, 2000, high in the S & P 500 at 1,527.46 marked the very top of the internet-fueled stock market mania of the late 1990s, followed by a stomach-churning sell-off that wiped out trillions of dollars in market value. By the close on Oct. 9, 2002, the S & P 500 had lost almost half its capitalization, plummeting more than 49% to a low of 776.76 from its peak of 1,527.46. The market eventually recovered, although not until May 30, 2007, when the S & P 500 closed at 1,530.23. Not by tech Contrary to popular belief, technology stocks are not close to dominating the list of the market's largest gains since the Clinton-era bubble burst. Outside of Nvidia , Apple and Ansys , all of the other largest outperformers come from far more prosaic industries, from energy drinks to footwear to an auto parts retailer, according to Bespoke's data . Of the three tech stocks, only Apple is considered one of the flagships of the 1990s boom. The Wall Street researcher said the iPhone maker sits on the list between farm supply retailer Tractor Supply and O'Reilly Automotive . Monster Beverage is the only 1,000-bagger on the list, having soared more than 100,000%. Below are some of the Russell 1000 stocks that appeared on Bespoke's ""100-Baggers"" list. Monster topped the chart as the best performer in the past 25 years, having soared more than 127,000% since March 24, 2000, making it the only ""1,000 bagger"" — a stock that has risen in value 1,000 times. Monster has also outpaced the market more recently, climbing almost 11% over the past month against the 3% loss in the S & P 500, about equal to the year-to-date returns as well. Wall Street is still bullish on Monster. Of 26 analysts, half rate it either a buy or strong buy, with 11 at a hold, according to LSEG data. Ugg and Hoka parent Deckers Outdoor is also one of the top stocks on the list, climbing almost 53,000% since March 24, 2000. Analysts remain optimistic, despite Deckers tumbling 41% over the past three months amid declining consumer confidence in the state of the U.S. economy. Some 16 of 23 analysts covering the shoe and apparel maker rate it the equivalent of a buy, with an average price target of about $218 implying more than 75% upside from Monday's close. Copper miner Southern Copper has also rewarded shareholders since the Greenspan years, jumping more than 15,000% over the past 25 years. Shares have also outperformed the broader market this year, climbing 12% year to date and 9% over the past month alone.",2025-03-25 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/these-100-bagger-stocks-are-up-the-most-in-the-last-25-years.html,cnbc
"Buy the Tesla dip because a bad quarter is already priced in, says New Street Research","It's only up from here for Tesla , according to New Street Research. In a Tuesday note, New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu stood by his buy rating on the beleaguered electric vehicle maker. Ferragu's price target of $465 suggests 67% upside from where Tesla shares closed on Monday. While Tesla popped about 12% on Monday , the stock still ended the session 43% below its December all-time high. Shares have faced a tough few months, with controversies mounting around CEO Elon Musk 's dominant role within the Trump administration. In addition, the company is expected to post a rough first quarter, reflecting an anticipated decline in deliveries for the period on a year-over-year basis. Car shopping site Edmunds also recently reported that Tesla owners have been trading in their vehicles at record levels. TSLA 1Y mountain TSLA 1Y chart Ferragu pointed out that while Musk's actions have grabbed headlines in the past — such as during his Twitter acquisition in 2022 — they ultimately did not have a materially negative effect on Tesla sales, and he doesn't expect them to do so this time either. The analyst added that Tesla's current problems are largely on the supply side, with demand in China remaining strong. Overall, he sees a roughly 5% decline in first-quarter deliveries year over year, ""in line with recent expectations."" Ultimately, Ferragu thinks the electric vehicle maker will be able to rise above the short-term headwinds plaguing shares. ""A bad quarter is in expectations. It will be the trough,"" he wrote.

An AI cybersecurity play and an opportunity to buy the dip on this market,"(This is a wrap-up of the key money moving discussions on CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" exclusive for PRO subscribers. Worldwide Exchange airs at 5 a.m. ET each day.) Piper Sandler makes its case for ""buying the dip,"" giving a list of stocks. Also, a trader looks for opportunity in an artificial intelligence play that was recently upgraded. Worldwide Exchange Pick: Cloudflare (NET) Tiffany McGhee of Pivotal Advisors said Cloudflare is a smart buy because of the versatility of its business. ""It has the potential to lead in AI and cybersecurity,"" McGhee said. ""It has a user friendly and scalable model as well as strength in network security, particularly with its Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture."" Cloudflare was double upgraded by Bank of America with it moving its rating to a buy and raising its price target to $160. Piper Sandler says ""buy the dip"" Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said the market is in an ""intermediate term low,"" and now is a time to buy stocks that have been affected by the volatility. ""There is no question that the longer-term trend, which is the secular long-term trend, still remains intact,"" Johnson said. ""This to us looks like a correction within the context of a long-term secular uptrend. Keep in mind, it took only 22 days to get a 10% correction in this market and our research shows … the faster the slide, the faster the recovery, is what we have seen. I would not be surprised to see a recovery in this market in the next two to three months.""

""I think that's smart. Reciprocal may be so dramatic that it's just not worth it. I would expect these to be negotiations focused on market access for U.S. exports,"" Gutierrez said. ""The first 60 days the tariff policy was aggressive. … I think he wants to get as much as he can from his tariff policy without doing a lot of damage and then move on to bigger items.""

"This 'Magnificent 7' play has had an ugly March, but it’s attractive at these levels, one strategist says","Meta Platforms has had a rough March, but the social media giant is a solid buy at these levels, according to Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management. The strategist went on CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Tuesday to give his takes on some of the market's biggest movers of the day. Here is what he had to say during ""Three-Stock Lunch."" Meta Platforms The Facebook parent has suffered alongside most of its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers in recent weeks, as Meta shares are down more than 6% in March. However, the social media stock is starting to look attractive, Grisanti said. This week, it has shown some signs of life, up 5%. It remains 15% off its recent peak, and is up nearly 7% from the start of the year. META 1D mountain Meta Platforms ""It's still trading at a market multiple. It's going to grow earnings double digits for the next three to four years,"" Grisanti said. ""The rub on it, of course, is huge AI spend. But the good news about that is, one, it's in the stock. But the second news is, if that's not panning out, you can dial it back pretty easily."" ""I like it a lot,"" he added. KB Home KB Home is in a tough position, Grisanti said. The strategist, who has liked homebuilders in the past, said he does not prefer them in an environment where interest rates might go lower because of a weakening economy. KBH 1D mountain KB Home ""It's funny because interest rates are probably going lower. You think, 'Well, that's a perfect thing for the homebuilders.' But I think they're going to go lower for the wrong reason, which is the economy is slowing. And it's hard to pick up a more cyclical industry than the homebuilding,"" Grisanti said. ""So, you think, 'Wow, it's down a lot.' 'Wow, earnings are coming off,'"" he added. ""But in this cycle, those things can go a lot further."" McCormick The strategist said he is on hold when it comes to the consumer staple stock, which may not be as attractive now that it is near all-time highs. McCormick shares have outperformed this year, as last year's high-flying tech stocks have simultaneously sold off. It is up more than 5% this year. It is off its recent peak by about 7%. ""McCormick held its own. That's what it was supposed to do.

"Investors should continue to avoid Boeing despite bullish news, technical analyst says","Investors should continue to practice caution when it comes to Boeing , despite the stock's outperformance in the past few days, according to Oppenheimer's Ari Wald. The firm's head of technical analysis joined CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Monday to offer his take on the beleaguered aerospace and defense stock. Here's what he had to say. Boeing Shares of Boeing popped 3% last Friday after winning a multibillion dollar fighter jet contract from the White House, beating out competitor Lockheed Martin. The stock ended last week 10% higher after CFO Brian West told investors at a Bank of America conference that Boeing's cash burn is easing this quarter. On the back of this news, on Monday Melius Research upgraded Boeing to a buy rating, pointing to a ""period of positive newsflow"" that could help boost the stock. Shares of Boeing ended Monday 1.6% higher. Despite this, Wald cautioned that he's still avoiding the stock at its current levels. ""I'm just skeptical about what I see as a longer-term trend of lower highs dating back to 2019; I just wouldn't be able to defend it on a pullback,"" he said. ""Now, we saw similar action in the stock in 2022 — that was really kind of the last time the stock started to break to the upside after a sustained down move. Consider though, that period was supported by this new bull market cycle."" ""I'm just unsure if strength can be sustained in what we see as this more later innings bull-market cycle. [If] the market tide recedes, I think Boeing comes in with it,"" Wald added. Palantir On the other hand, Wald singled out Palantir as one of his favorite stocks due to its high momentum. Despite falling off its all-time high, the software stock has rallied in recent days, adding 4% on Friday and 6.4% on Monday. ""The stock has been able to hold support levels. I think it is still intact. And actually, contrary to popular belief, short-term trading aside, we have shown the factor has typically outperformed, both into a major top and coming out of it as well,"" Wald said. ""So again, while there is risk for — I think — equity markets as a whole, I like Palantir. I think it looks better than the market. It's still in an uptrend."" Dutch Bros Wald is also bullish on Dutch Bros . On Monday, the coffee chain stock added 7.7% after Morgan Stanley initiated shares at an overweight rating and $82 price target, representing 25% upside for the stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour said that Dutch Bros' new management should boost the chain's medium-term outlook. ""The uptrend is intact here,"" Wald said. ""I think with today's breakout move — jumping back above the 50-day average at $67 — I think the trade is for a test to that low-80 mark. And I think that's the trade that we see in the upside potential."" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

Why this CIO is sounding the alarm on two key consumer bellwether stocks,"Even as valuations for both Nike and FedEx stock come down to a more attractive level, both stocks are still a sell, according to Main Street Research chief investment officer James Demmert. Shares of FedEx have pulled back more than 18% in 2025, while Nike's stock has slipped about 10%. On Thursday, FedEx slashed its full-year forecast , citing macroeconomic uncertainty, while Nike executives said they expect headwinds in the current quarter as consumer sentiment weakens amid talk of tariffs on a range of consumer goods. Here's what Demmert had to say on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Friday. FedEx FedEx shares ended Friday down 6.5%, after hitting a fresh 52-week low. ""Even at 14 times earnings, I don't think this is a healthy choice for lunch,"" Demmert said. Instead, he said he preferred to be an owner of Parker-Hannifin or Hitachi , which he said benefits from being more diversified. He noted that this latest quarter was the third time in a row that the shipping company has slashed its profit outlook and missed revenue estimates. That trend has pushed him to a sell rating on the stock. FDX YTD mountain FedEx stock in 2025. That said, most analysts still have a buy or strong buy on FedEx shares, according to LSEG. The average price target is $310.72, which suggests shares could rise more than 34%. Nike Demmert also had little conviction for Nike, questioning its ability to compete with trendier brands such as Hoka. He said a better choice in the consumer discretionary sector is Booking Holdings or Netflix . NKE YTD mountain Nike stock in 2025. ""Even at 13 times earnings,"" he said, ""we'd still be a seller"" of Nike stock. Nike is being hurt by souring consumer sentiment and the threat of a trade war, which could make its products more expensive. The company is in the early days of a turnaround, but with performance worsening as the fiscal fourth quarter progressed, it seems as though it will take a while for those efforts to gain traction. With Friday's 5% drop, Nike shares have fallen more than 33% over the past 12 months. Cleveland-Cliffs Elsewhere, Demmert called Cleveland-Cliffs ""another disastrous stock"" after it reported declining sales and weak results in its latest quarter. Shares are roughly flat year to date, but have pulled back more than 13% so far in March. CLF YTD mountain Cleveland-Cliffs stock in 2025. Demmert said he preferred industrial gas company Linde among materials stocks. He said he is cautious on Cleveland-Cliffs because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, even though the company is a U.S. steel producer. Demmert said he prefers greater exposure to overseas markets.

"Here’s why Tesla still has more room to fall, one investor says","Beleaguered electric vehicle maker Tesla has been forced to contend with a tumultuous past few months, but its woes are not over yet, according to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. Shares of Tesla have tumbled 42% in 2025, erasing their postelection rally. On Thursday, the stock briefly slipped as much as 2.5% after Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks due to a cosmetic exterior panel that could increase the risks of a crash. TSLA 1Y mountain TSLA 1Y chart But in an interview on CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Thursday, Schlossberg said Tesla has further to fall. The main reason is because Tesla has so far been ""treated as a tech fantasy on autonomous driving,"" the money manager said. But the longer it takes for Tesla to crack autonomous driving, the more analysts might start treating the stock like an ordinary automobile company. "" Valuation and everything else at Tesla is really dependent upon this dream of autonomous driving, and until they actually achieve it, [the stock] could be rerated as purely a core car company,"" he said. ""And the car business is a tough business — it has much lower multiples than Tesla is getting — so there's so much more compression to go in Tesla, unless it really achieves a breakthrough. So at this point, I think it's really not a buy."" Schlossberg also currently has a hold rating on discount retailer Five Below , and views Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava as a pass as well. ""Love the business, hate the stock,"" Schlossberg said of Cava. JPMorgan upgraded its investment opinion on Cava on Thursday, saying investors should buy the fast-casual restaurant stock after its recent decline.",2025-03-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/heres-why-tesla-still-has-more-room-to-fall-one-investor-says.html,cnbc
Danny Moses of 'The Big Short' says the market is underestimating DOGE's negative impact on the economy,"Investor Danny Moses, who made a killing betting against mortgage-backed debt before the 2008 crash, said Thursday the market is mistakenly failing to discount the negative effect from federal spending cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency. ""I think we are underestimating the impact to the economy of the cuts we're making at the federal government, and what that might mean [in terms of] the knock on effects into the economy,"" Moses, Moses Ventures founder, said on CNBC's "" The Exchange. "" DOGE's cost-cutting moves led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk , could create a negative shock in the system with layoffs eroding corporate revenue growth in the near term. The billionaire tech entrepreneur, with Trump's blessing, has reduced federal headcount by more than 60,000 , spanning 17 agencies, according to an estimate from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""I think we're hurting the revenue side of the equation. When your debt to GDP is over 120% you really can't make a mistake,"" Moses said. ""I think we are being overly optimistic [as to] how this is going to play out.... we're going to start to hear, when first quarter earnings are reported, that there is a market slowdown potentially, and a hit to consumer confidence, which you've already seen, which I don't think [is] priced into the markets."" President Donald Trump 's protectionist trade policy stoked fears of an economic slowdown, causing a month-long pullback in the S & P 500 that last week dragged it into a correction. The S & P 500 has recovered some of the losses, and today sits about 8% below its February all-time high. Moses shot to fame thanks to Michael Lewis' book "" The Big Short "" and the subsequent Oscar-winning movie of the same name. The investor revealed that he's still bullish on gold even after the bullion climbed above the $3,000 record milestone lately. Moses said he also likes online gambling stocks, naming Genius Sports as his favorite. He noted that the industry is insulated from Trump's aggressive tariffs and the companies are early adopters of artificial intelligence.",2025-03-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/moses-of-the-big-short-says-market-underestimating-doges-negative-impact.html,cnbc
"Nvidia's recent rebound could be a good sign for Trump's trade negotiations, Tom Lee says","The recent rebound in shares of Nvidia is a sign that investors do not expect a worst-case outcome from the trade negotiations between the U.S. and other major economies, especially China, according to Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee. The firm's head of research told CNBC's Bob Pisani at the Future Proof conference in Miami on Monday that he found it notable that President Donald Trump has been less vocal about China when discussing trade policy in recent weeks. While Lee said he did not know for sure what was happening between the White House and Beijing, the lack of rhetoric could be a sign that negotiations are progressing and ""that would probably explain why Nvidia has been outperforming, as well,"" he explained. Nvidia closed at $106.98 per share on March 10, its lowest since September. Since then, Nvidia has risen in three out of five sessions, for a total gain of more than 11%. ""If there was a global trade war, and we risked a recession, Nvidia would still be derating,"" Lee said. ""The 'P/E' should be coming down because all of a sudden everyone wouldn't even know what the 'E' looks like. So the fact that has stabilized I think is very telling,"" he added, referring to the price-to-earnings ratio. NVDA 1M mountain Shares of Nvidia have rebounded off their March 10 lows. Trump has imposed additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods on two separate occasions already since he took office. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, and the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said earlier this month that it was ready for a ""tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war ."" But the situation has not escalated beyond those comments over the past 10 days. That is different from the tariff back-and-forth with Mexico and Canada, which has seen frequent public changes. Trump said Monday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would visit the U.S. in the not-too distant future, Reuters reported, which may also hint at progress in trade talks. Nvidia is a semiconductor company whose advanced chips have made it one of the key players in artificial intelligence and one of the biggest stocks in the world by market capitalization. Shares of the company, which is hosting a developer conference in California this week, are down 11% year to date.",2025-03-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/nvidias-rebound-could-be-good-sign-for-trump-trade-talks-tom-lee-says.html,cnbc
"Two oversold stocks to buy on strong consumer retail sales, according to MJP Wealth Advisors CIO","February's retail sales data pointed to a strong consumer, adding to the bull case for Delta Air Lines, according to investor Brian Vendig. The chief investment officer at MJP Wealth Advisors joined CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Monday to offer his take on the airline carrier, as well as a pair of other stocks from CNBC's most recent oversold stocks list . Here's what he had to say during the Three-Stock Lunch segment. Delta Air Lines Growing concerns over a softening economy have been a challenge for airline stocks. Delta Air Lines has been no exception, with shares trading 23% lower so far this year. Delta ""got caught up pretty hard in this growth scare,"" Vendig acknowledged. However, he noted shares are trading at an attractive valuation based on its forward price-to-earnings ratio. Also, February's retail sales data could be a catalyst for the stock as it suggests consumer spending is holding up. ""When we think about the company fundamentally, it issued a pretty robust revenue guidance for 2025 that would be better than the prior year,"" Vendig said. ""Plus, I think the consumer is not dead, as we saw from the retail sales numbers this morning, and consumers are looking for an experience,"" he added. ""Lastly, factor in any changes in oil prices going down in the future. That's also going to help the margin for the stock."" Lululemon Athletica Shares of Lululemon Athletica popped 5% on Monday, bucking its overall downward trend over the past year. The stock has tumbled 30% over the past 12 months and more than 10% so far in March. But Vendig believes Lululemon should have a better time than it did last year, again pointing to the strong February retail sales report as proof. ""We saw growth and a good presence in the online numbers in the retail sales, and with the consumer still spending, Lulu is really leaning in on that online presence,"" Vendig said. ""We saw in some analysts' notes this morning that having a wider breadth and more exposure to some social media channels has really helped to support sales."" Accenture On the other hand, Vendig was less bullish on Accenture , calling it a stock where investors should ""take a little bit of a step back."" Shares of the professional services provider have slipped 13% over the past 12 months. Vendig pointed out that the stock has been popular among investors who hope that higher corporate IT budgets will translate into more consulting revenue. However, a highly uncertain economic backdrop makes the stock look less appealing at this time. ""At the end of the day, there's a lot of macro noise — as we all know — and that can really cause companies to take a closer look at their IT spending and budgets, depending on how these economic policies play out. So I think in the short term, this is one to hold and just be a little bit more cautious on until we get a clear picture of some of those policy decisions,"" Vendig said.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/two-oversold-stocks-to-buy-on-strong-consumer-retail-sales-according-to-mjp-wealth-advisors-cio.html,cnbc
"Apple had an ugly week. Here’s why it’s worth buying, investor Nancy Tengler says","Apple's terrible week could be a buying opportunity for investors, according to Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. Tengler, an investor known for her ""old economy"" stock plays, appeared on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Friday to give her hot takes on some of the market's biggest movers. Here is what she had to say during ""Three-Stock Lunch."" Apple The tech giant had a horrible week, off nearly 11% in the period despite Friday's relief bounce. Still, Tengler views the stock's recent performance as an opportunity for investors who are in it for the long haul. The iPhone maker's weekly decline brought its year-to-date loss to nearly 15%. About a week ago Apple delayed artificial intelligence improvements to its Siri voice assistant until 2026. Those changes were supposed to take effect this spring. ""I think you can buy it in here,"" Tengler said. ""There have been two great times to buy this stock. The Apple Maps debacle, the stock's up 1,100% since then, and the earnings warning in January of 2019, stocks up 550% [since then]. So you can step into this name when it disappoints the market."" Apple shares are still up more than 23% over the past 12 months. Starbucks According to Tengler, Starbucks is a ""Brian Niccol story"" that's already proving itself. The stock is up 28% since Niccol took over as the company's CEO in early September, Tengler said, adding that Starbucks should save costs since the CEO, who came over from Chitpotle, has moved quickly to remove discounts and simplify the coffee chain's menu. He's also cut corporate roles at headquarters as part of the company's turnaround strategy. ""You're getting paid to wait,"" Tengler said. ""You're getting a 9% dividend growth over the last five years, and earnings growth is expected to accelerate. So I think this is when you can even buy here, and certainly with the recent pullback, and then you plan to hold it for quite some time."" Starbucks shares are down almost 13% in the past month, underperforming the broader market, but still ahead 7.4% so far in 2025, significantly outperforming the S & P 500. Adobe By contrast to the other two, Adobe is a ""value trap,"" according to Tengler. Adobe's stock price lost more than 12% this week following the company's latest quarterly financial report which, while beating estimates, nonetheless drove investors to question Adobe's strategy to make money on its artificial intelligence strategy. ""This company has continued to disappoint. Management's been evasive. They do have an investor day next week, so I wouldn't do anything in front of that. And they do have pricing power — they haven't raised prices for many years,"" Tengler said. ""So there are some potential catalysts, but they're just not delivering and they are not charging for AI because they don't think they are adding enough value yet."" Adobe shares are down 11% this year, and almost 31% over the past year.",2025-03-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/apple-had-an-ugly-week-why-its-worth-buying-investor-tengler-says.html,cnbc
"Two stocks for investors' buy lists during this sell-off, according to Tim Seymour","Thursday marked yet another day of the broad market sell-off, and that could provide a buying opportunity for Novo Nordisk and Energy Transfer , according to Tim Seymour of Seymour Asset Management. The firm's founder and chief investment officer appeared on CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Thursday to share his bullish take on those stocks, as well as one investors should avoid. Here's what Seymour had to say. Novo Nordisk Shares of global healthcare company Novo Nordisk have pulled back as of late, falling almost 14% in the past week, but Seymour believes it's ""very misunderstood."" ""This is a really attractive name that people forget is part of the secular growth story, and they may be the bigger player with supply constraints [having] eased up quite a bit,"" he said. When it comes to the company's compound annual growth rate, the investor anticipates that it's going to grow more than 20%. Additionally, the investor pointed to its valuation, as Novo Nordisk has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of almost 19, according to FactSet. ""I think it's very attractive, very misunderstood here,"" Seymour continued. Energy Transfer During times of market volatility especially, the investor believes Energy Transfer provides an attractive entry point for investors. ""This is the best way to get exposure to gas demand and NGO and some oil,"" the investor said. ""Make no mistake, this is a conservative play in a difficult market. I love this one."" While the energy stock has risen nearly 3% in the past week, shares have fallen more than 8% in the past month. Affirm Affirm – a buy now, pay later loans provider – has underperformed the broader market lately, falling more than 10% in the past week and more than 40% in the past month. Seymour thinks this is one that investors should stay away from moving forward. ""They say they're going to be EPS positive in 2025. I just think in the world we're in, with consumer confidence pulling in, with all the uncertainty, you do not want to be in this space,"" he said. While Seymour said Affirm is ""known for being credit nimble,"" he believes that the credit nimble story has yet to be put to the test. ""I don't know why you would be in a consumer credit story here that hasn't really been through one of these cycles before,"" the investor continued. ""This is not one you're owning in this environment.""",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/two-stocks-for-investors-buy-list-during-this-sell-off-according-to-tim-seymour.html,cnbc
"This stock trading platform has little upside left ahead, says wealth advisor Garcia","Even as shares of retail trading platform Robinhood have pulled back more than 11% so far this week, investors should still be cautious about jumping back in, according to Payne Capital Management senior wealth advisor Courtney Garcia. Robinhood stock was higher on Wednesday, climbing roughly 8%. It entered 2025 on a high note after President Donald Trump's election win and a swell of enthusiasm tied to his pro-cryptocurrency position. The broader market regained some ground on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite adding 1%, following three weeks of losses. But Garcia said much of the upside from the cryptocurrency story for Robinhood has already been priced into the stock. She joined CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Wednesday to discuss Robinhood, as well as Johnson & Johnson and AT & T . Robinhood Garcia said higher trading volumes on Robinhood's platform aren't enough to convince her that shares have room to appreciate. ""I would actually stay away from Robinhood here,"" Garcia said. ""What you're seeing is, with this new administration, people were very pro crypto and you're seeing more trading going in there which has benefited them, but a lot of that I think has already been priced in."" Shares have advanced about 6% in 2025. Seven of 10 analysts polled by FactSet who cover the stock rate it the equivalent of a buy, with the consensus 12-month price target on Robinhood implying more than 74% upside ahead. ""What you're seeing is they kind of trade with that risk-on trade,"" she added. AT & T Garcia said telecommunications provider AT & T has a value profile, and lauded the company's efforts to pay back its debt. ""Even with their debt load, you're seeing that they're having optimism that they are going to bring down their debt,"" Garcia said. ""Plus, they have $10 billion in share buybacks [scheduled] later this year, which is just showing optimism in their cash flow and how the company is doing in order to sustain their dividend moving forward."" Shares have gained more than 13% in 2025. Seventy percent of analysts covering AT & T rate it the equivalent of a buy, according to FactSet, with the consensus price target calling for more than 5% upside ahead over the next 12 months. Garcia also called AT & T a turnaround story due to its planned divestiture of its stake in DirecTV later this year. AT & T pays a dividend yield equal to about 4.27%, according to FactSet data. Johnson & Johnson While Garcia said she is somewhat neutral on Johnson & Johnson stock, she noted that she still thinks it is a worthwhile value stock. ""This is a company I always use as an example of a value company. It's not going to change the world overnight, [but] it does pay a good dividend,"" she said. ""This is a company that does tend to weather economic downturns."" Johnson & Johnson has advanced about 13% in 2025. Roughly 48% of the analysts covering the stock rate it the equivalent of a buy, according to FactSet, and the consensus price target suggests maybe 5% upside in the coming year. J & J pays a dividend equal to roughly a 2.99% yield.",2025-03-12 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/this-stock-trading-platform-has-little-upside-left-ahead-says-wealth-advisor-garcia.html,cnbc
Josh Brown says the Tesla stock trend is so broken that any bounce won't last,"Don't trust any near-term bounces in Tesla shares even with the electric vehicle stock tumbling more than 50% from its peak, according to Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown. The widely followed trader believes the technical trend in Tesla's stock chart has collapsed, making any rebound unsustainable. He also pointed to Tesla's sky-high valuation of 113-times forward earnings even after the recent sell-off cut the multiple in half. ""If it's going to bounce, it should bounce right now. The problem is the chart, the trend is so fundamentally broken that … you could get a 12% rally in Tesla because [CEO Elon Musk] comes out and announces a buyback or something. I don't think it lasts,"" Brown said on CNBC's "" Halftime Report "" on Tuesday. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla Tesla shares have been on a roller-coaster ride since Musk went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House. Tesla just suffered a seventh straight week of losses, its longest stretch of weekly declines since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010. The stock rose more than 1% Tuesday, its first positive day in four. Brown said many large-cap stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index share troublesome characteristics with Tesla shares. ""There are a lot of stocks like that, and a lot of big market cap stocks, and I think that's what makes this moment very tricky,"" Brown said. ""There's an old saying on the Street: 'nothing good ever happens just below the 200-day moving average.' I think that applies to the Nasdaq 100 right now, and most of the names in there.""",2025-03-11 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/josh-brown-says-the-tesla-stock-trend-is-so-broken-that-any-bounce-wont-last.html,cnbc
"Two stocks to snap up during the sell-off, including one tech 'screaming buy,' says investor Greene","Shares of Meta Platforms are suffering in Monday's big sell-off, and they are worth snapping up, according to G Squared Private Wealth's Victoria Greene. The information technology sector of the S & P 500 suffered keenly as the stock market swooned amid investors' heightening fears of a recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid roughly 4% on Monday afternoon, and Meta tumbled more than 4%. The chief investment officer joined CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Monday to discuss the tech giant, as well as Williams-Sonoma and Coinbase . Here's what she had to say about each: Meta Platforms Greene considers Meta a buy, saying the Facebook parent has been unfairly swept up in the recent tech sell-off. The G Squared founding partner said Meta can increase profit through artificial intelligence with targeted ads. She said the company should have more insulated revenue than other megacap tech companies due to its range of products. ""For me, this is a screaming buy,"" she said. ""I love Meta. They're one of the only companies that is actually implementing AI to drive higher revenues."" Meta is up just about 2% in 2025, making it the best performer of stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven."" Yet, Wall Street sees a rebound. The average analyst has a buy rating and a price target suggesting shares can rally more than 26%, per LSEG. Williams-Sonoma Williams-Sonoma is a topic of discussion following the Friday announcement that it would enter into the benchmark S & P 500 index later this month. Greene called the stock a buy. Looking ahead to quarterly results from the home retailer, she said to expect ""brisk"" holiday sales. Greene also said guidance will be paramount, with the retailer needing to show an improvement in big-ticket purchases. ""It's a buy for me going into earnings next week,"" Greene said. She also noted that Williams-Sonoma is driven more by the Pottery Barn brand currently, which she called a more defensive segment. Williams-Sonoma shares are up less than 1% this year, which is modest after back-to-back years of big runs. Most analysts polled by LSEG have a hold rating, with a price target implying shares will be roughly flat from here. WSM 1Y mountain WIlliams-Sonoma, 1-year Coinbase On the other hand, Greene told investors to dump Coinbase . The crypto trading platform was considered a candidate that was snubbed from S & P 500 inclusion. Shares also took a bath on Monday, tanking more than 16% as bitcoin fell. Greene questioned the company's competitive edge if crypto becomes more regulated and mainstream. She said the stock could likely retest the one-year low around $150. COIN 1Y mountain Coinbase, 1-year ""To me, it's still not a buy,"" Greene said. ""I'd honestly just sell it."" With Monday's sell-off, Coinbase shares are now down 27% year to date. But Wall Street foresees a big bounce. While the majority of analysts polled by LSEG have hold ratings, the average price target reflects upside of 83%. ""I think it's a bad time to be buying this type of risk,"" Greene said. ""Just because it's low doesn't mean it can't go lower.""",2025-03-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/two-stocks-to-buy-during-the-sell-off-including-one-tech-screaming-buy-says-investor-greene.html,cnbc

"More gains are ahead for this defense stock, according to the charts","Howmet Aerospace is a well-positioned industrial company within the aerospace & defense industry pressing all-time highs, despite the February- March volatility storm. HWM, formerly part of Alcoa, was focused on the oil & gas industry until a rebrand in 2020 when they re-focused on primarily aerospace, defense and commercial transportation markets. Looking around in aerospace and defense, there are some standout companies that have weathered the market pullback quite well including Kratos Defense & Security , Heico , General Dynamics , even Boeing and General Electric (even though GE is classified as an Industrial Conglomerate). All of these stocks look tradable to the upside in light of the Trump administration's policies aimed at reshoring manufacturing, the implementation of AI within aerospace & defense, and a strong rebound in air travel. Howmet is well positioned in two specific areas of commercial aerospace and industrial gas turbines. We first added HWM to our growth portfolio at Inside Edge Capital on June 24, 2024 with a 1% allocation. Even though the stock is up approximately 75% in that time, during the next reallocation I plan to increase the size by at least a 2% allocation once we have a bit more confidence the broader market pullback is complete. Based on last week's article of the broader market successfully holding our support levels ( almost exactly at our levels ). I think it's about time to attack. Turning to the technicals on the weekly chart, you'll see a beautiful uptrend that began in October 2023 that has formed quite a formidable parallel trend channel (green). Amid the recent market pullback, HWM tested parallel channel support along with the 20-week moving average (orange) and re-engaged on the upside ahead of the broader market averages. Highlighted below the chart is some scary good yearly percentage EPS growth (for an industrial company) of 88%, 65% and 54%. And though 2025 is expected to moderate out to just a 17% growth, 2026 is looking to move back above 20% growth. Looking at the daily chart, you can see a similarly impressive quarterly EPS growth that should be able to carry it above the dotted green resistance breakout level to new highs. If we do in fact increase our position size, I will use a stop around the March lows of $120 for the entirety of the position. I do understand the stock commands a higher valuation with a current PE of 48. But when you consider the EPS growth rate and solid position in the explosive growth sectors discussed, the forward PE of 31 X's 2026 expected earnings of $4.04 based on a last trade of $136.32 may not seem all that stretched. Of course, it is the combination of fundamentals and technicals to manage risk on high growth positions like this that allows us to actively manage our stock portfolios. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

"Amazon shares could have further to run in the short-term, says Katie Stockton","The megacap growth complex has been a source of downside leadership so far this year, noting Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla all fall in the bottom quintile of S & P 500 member returns year-to-date. After becoming deeply oversold in the short term, many of these laggards are likely to lead the brief relief rally already underway in the broad-based S & P 500 Index. Among the megacaps, Amazon (AMZN) catches our eye as a stock that has compelling short-term risk-reward potential. The stock appears to have found its footing in response to short-term oversold conditions after penetrating its 200-day moving average (MA), which resides near $200. We often find that the widely watched 200-day MA serves as a cushion of support, meaning that brief dips below often occur before a recovery is staged. Monday, AMZN is back above its 200-day MA on a ""breakaway gap"" higher, and the daily MACD indicator has a 'buy' signal to suggest short-term momentum has improved meaningfully. Both factors suggest a bigger rebound is likely over the next two weeks, at a minimum. A short-term upside objective for AMZN is the 50-day MA, near $218, which is nearly 8% above current levels. Just a trade While the short-term set-up is compelling after a steep sell-off, the monthly chart of AMZN suggests the outlook for the rest of 2025 has deteriorated. In January, AMZN flashed a monthly counter-trend 'sell' signal per Tom DeMark's TD Combo model, which supports a prolonged pause within the broader secular uptrend. The monthly MACD histogram has a made a lower high, suggesting the uptrend drawn back to the 2022 low may be losing its hold given a loss of upside momentum. The conflicting indications from the daily and monthly bar charts of AMZN suggest that a bigger relief rally should be viewed as counter-trend and likely short-lived. Counter-trend positions are inherently risky and warrant risk management via the use of a stop-loss discipline. For those with existing exposure to AMZN, we would use the bounce as an opportunity to reduce exposure in anticipation of a more difficult year for megacap stocks. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

Tesla's 12-week, 55% decline leaves the stock down to a well-defined, multi-year trendline in effect since 2019 when TSLA traded at $12 a share. Bulls are making a stand here, believing that the stock now is very cheap. Bears are pressing their bets, believing the worst is yet to come. From a technical standpoint, breaking trend is never good. We ourselves believe that's what's in store for Tesla. We remain sellers.

"This travel stock hit hard during the market pullback is primed for a comeback, according to the charts","The travel and tourism trade has been struggling in 2025, particularly for US-based names including airlines and cruise lines. While shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) are currently down about 22% off their January peak, this cruise line is now testing key price support and could be setting up for a decent recovery trade. At the end of January, RCL had bounced off its 50-day moving average to achieve a new all-time high around $275. A gap higher around January earnings, however, can now be labeled an ""exhaustion gap"" as it represented the last gasp higher after an incredible bullish run going back to early 2023. From there, shares of RCL have demonstrated a clear short-term downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, bringing the price down to its 200-day moving average for only the third time in the last three years. The two previous tests of this long-term trend barometer, in August 2024 and October 2023, have seen a dramatic upside reversal and eventual new highs. What would suggest a similar path into Q2 2025? We can see that the Relative Strength Index (RSI), my preferred method of measuring price momentum, is showing a very similar pattern to those previous major lows. Oversold conditions as the price tests a major support level often indicate a buyable dip within a long-term uptrend phase. What's most important on those previous lows for Royal Caribbean is what happened after the test of the 200-day moving average. In both the August 2024 and October 2023 lows, RCL bounced up above the 50-day moving average while the RSI pushed above the 50 level. This bullish configuration after the low indicated an improving trend and increased momentum, serving to confirm that the recent low was in fact an ideal entry point. Looking at the current price structure, that would mean we need a rally above the 50-day moving average around $238, as well as the RSI pushing above the 50 level to demonstrate improving momentum characteristics. In terms of risk management, it's vital that RCL holds the 200-day moving average. As we've seen recently with many of the Mag7 names and other growth stocks, a break of the 200-day moving average often leads to much further deterioration. We are watching the $200 level to confirm that the 200-day moving average holds. Assuming upside back toward the January 2025 highs, and limiting our downside to the 200-day moving average, we have a fairly attractive risk-reward setup. One final thought is that the volume could provide another way to validate the price action. Despite the pullback in price, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has remained above zero. This volume indicator actually weights the daily volume readings based on where the stock closes relative to the daily high and low. So with the CMF remaining above zero, would infer that investors are accumulating shares despite the broader downtrend since January. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

This stock is grinding higher even as the rest of the market struggles,"The S & P 500 has just experienced its first 10% correction since last summer, with many other indices, ETFs, and individual stocks experiencing even steeper drawdowns. Few names have been spared. That's why when a stock not only holds up well but also approaches a major technical breakout, it demands our attention. CBOE is one of those stocks. We first flagged it to clients on February 20, 2025 — the day right after the S & P 500 made its last all-time high. At the time, the stock still had work to do, and we emphasized that breakouts should never be anticipated before they actually happen. But keeping strong set-ups on our radar is always a smart move. Despite the broader market struggles over last four weeks, CBOE has continued to grind higher, showing notable relative strength. Now, after a month of steady progress, it's attempting to break out of the pattern we've been watching. Holding above $215-zone would confirm the breakout, with an initial target in the $247 zone. CBOE is classified within the capital markets industry of the XLF Financial Sector ETF . The group, which is comprised of 19 stocks, has a big footprint within the sector, accounting for a 22% weighting. However, CBOE ranks just 17/19 and has a tiny 0.33% sector weight, easily making it one of the smallest components in the sector. Despite its size, CBOE consistently outperformed XLF from 2021 through late 2023. But given that it's basically net flat since last August, it had noticeably lagged other financial stocks (until the last few weeks), many of which were making new highs as recently as this past February. Therefore, as discussed above, if CBOE now can break out on an absolute basis, the stock could also punch through its downward-sloping channel relative to XLF. Clearing that level would open the door for a resumption of the relative uptrend that began four years ago. Finally, this lifetime monthly chart of CBOE highlights a clear pattern — the stock's most significant breakouts since its 2010 inception have consistently led to months of upside follow-through. While the weekly chart's formation may seem large, it's actually one of the smallest when viewed in the context of this longer-term perspective. Given this history, a successful breakout followed by continued upside wouldn't be out of the ordinary. For this scenario to unfold soon, CBOE must first confirm its current breakout attempt. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

3 technical indicators to watch as stocks try to find a bottom,"The S & P 500 is attempting to rebound from the lows set Thursday. It's still too early to tell if this low will hold and a new rally was born. To help answer this question, let's open the proverbial market hood to examine three internal gauges of the market engine. We'll refer to these simply as ""market internals."" I'll try to explain some of these more in-depth metrics more clearly than a mechanic would explain to us how our car engine is going to be fixed and how long it might last. To start, let's use a market internal that you may have heard of: the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) . The VIX is referred to as the 'fear index' and measures how expensive S & P 500 options are at strike prices relatively close to the current market price. The higher the price of the options, the more in demand they are which almost always corresponds to fear and uncertainty as traders hedge stock portfolios holdings. So, VIX usually trades inversely to the S & P 500. The key to finding potential reversal points in the stock market is to use the internals at turning points that either confirm the current trend, or non-confirmations that the stock market trend may reverse. In the case of the VIX, a spike higher followed by a lower-high, coupled with a lower-low in the S & P 500 price, is an example of a non-confirmation. A quite significant VIX non-confirmation happened in December and January that set up a rally into February. A smaller non-confirmation is happening with the VIX at the two most recent market spikes in March. The recent VIX surge on March 13 was a lower-high while the S & P 500 that made a lower-low. You can interpret this as option traders not aggressively hedging via long puts despite the S & P 500's lower-low in price. In other words, fear is subsiding. Moving away from options internals to breadth indicators, we have the NYSE Advancing - Declining issues indicator. As a bull market powers on, you would like to see more advancing issues than declining ones, indicating mass participation in the rally. In the case of bear markets that are expected to continue lower, the opposite should be true. But again, the predictive power is in the turning points with non-confirmations, also called divergences. Notice how the S & P 500 in red made a low in March, but the Advance-Decline difference line made a higher-low. The breadth in the mid-March decline is drying up. Fewer stocks are being sold. Finally let's look at the NYSE TICK chart. This is the most advanced internal and measures the number of up-ticking stocks versus down-ticking stocks on the NYSE second-by-second. When you see a clustering of -700 to -1200 TICK readings, that means literally this second there are 700-1200 more down-ticking stocks than up-ticking ones. This detects when institutions are doing ""program sells,"" which is when they liquidate a basket of stocks in one big automated block trade. They could be selling S & P 500 , Nasdaq-100 , or even all stocks in the XLK (technology ETF). The same is true for extreme positive TICK readings in the case of program buy trades. Again, you're looking for non-confirmation divergences in NYSE TICK based on the 20-period moving average to smooth out the erratic readings. You'll see a nice TICK divergence in December and January that traced a higher-low as the S & P made a lower-low, to then reverse and rally into February. The same is happening again with the February low compared to the March 11 lows in NYSE TICK. Are these three market internals signaling that a tradable low is in place? My best guess is yes. As we turn to the S & P 500 daily chart with a 60-minute chart inset, we see the retracement levels that must hold relative to the March 13 low. We should hold above 5,579 and 5,545 to keep alive hopes of a sustained recovery. If I'm wrong, then 5500 breaks and we're probably headed down to the Q4 of '24 lows of 5,405 and from there we'll start the process over again. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC DISCLOSURES: Gordon is long the market in his holdings at Inside Edge Capital, but carrying SPX put option hedges.

"This private equity giant is primed for a rebound, according to the charts","Private market giants have struggled to start the year amid market uncertainty, but now appear poised to stabilize after a significant downturn. One of the biggest players, KKR & Co. (KKR) , presents an attractive short-term set-up and looks well-positioned to benefit from a rebound in the broader market. KKR has oversold 'buy' signals from the daily stochastics and the DeMARK Indicators, supporting a minimum two-week relief rally. Initial resistance can be found at the 200-day MA (~$132), while secondary resistance can be found at the daily cloud (~$154). KKR fell below its 200-day (40-week) moving average and is now into support from its weekly cloud model, near $115. This further increases the likelihood of a bounce and provides favorable risk-reward in the short term. However, intermediate-term momentum is negative, suggesting that there is more work to be done before we feel confident a significant low is established. An upturn in the weekly stochastics back above 20% would provide evidence to this end. Secondary support can be found at the bottom of the weekly cloud ~$94, a level we wouldn't be surprised to see tested before a more lasting low is established. The monthly chart shows headwinds that paint a less favorable picture for remainder of the year. A downturn in the monthly stochastics from overbought levels, coupled with a pinched monthly MACD on the verge of turning lower, indicates that KKR will face several months of corrective price action. This suggests the short-term bullish context should be considered counter-trend and give way to a lower high. Other stocks like Blackstone (BX) and Apollo (APO) share similar setups, with short-term signs of downside exhaustion supporting a snap-back rally after a steep sell-off. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

"S&P 500 has further downside ahead, according to three chart indicators","With the S & P 500 already about 10% off its February high, investors are anxiously awaiting some sign of a tradeable low. Based on our analysis of market breadth indicators in mid-March, investors may have to wait a bit longer for a meaningful market bottom. Today we'll break down three market breadth indicators that suggest further potential downside before this downtrend phase is exhausted. One of the simplest measures of market breadth, the cumulative advance-decline line, is created by calculating a running total of the daily data on advancers versus decliners. This allows us to chart the trend of the daily readings over time, and better understand when the breadth readings confirm the price action in the major equity averages. Here we can see the cumulative advance-declines for the New York Stock Exchange, S & P 500 large cap index, the S & P 400 midcap index, and S & P 600 small cap index. Note how the midcap and small cap A-D lines have already broken below their January lows, while the NYSE A-D line is very close to doing so. Basically, this chart tells us that since November 2024, breadth data has been deteriorating for all of these cap tiers. A breakdown in the NYSE advance-decline line could come as early as today, which would bring an additional bearish confirmation for stocks as we approach the end of Q1. Next, we can look at the percent of S & P 500 members that are above their 50 and 200-day moving averages. This chart provided a fantastic early warning in late 2024 of the weakness to come in early 2025. The bottom panel shows the percent of stocks above their 50-day moving average, which was up around 85% at the end of Q3 2024. This indicator plunged to below 20% by mid-December as the S & P 500 pulled back, and then only reached up to 60% when the S & P 500 made a new high in January. This bearish divergence suggested limited upside potential for the major equity averages due to a notable lack of breadth support. The panel above shows the percent of S & P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving average, providing a more long-term gauge of market breadth conditions. This week, the indicator has dropped below the crucial 50% level, a signal which usually only comes during a confirmed bearish phase for the S & P 500. The last time we observed this negative signal was in September 2023, when the S & P 500 declined another six weeks before achieving an eventual low. Finally, let's consider a market breadth indicator based on point and figure charts, known as the Bullish Percent Index. This indicator looks at the point and figure charts of all S & P 500 members, and determines how many of them have most recently posted a buy signal using the point and figure methodology. Based on our analysis of the indicator, there could be further downside for the S & P 500 before the traditional bullish signal can be reached. When the Bullish Percent Index goes below the 30% level, that tells us to prepare for a major low because over 70% of S & P 500 have registered a sell signal on their point and figure charts. When the BPI rotates back above the 30% level, it means that enough S & P 500 stocks are registering buy signals that the index should begin to rise as a result. We've highlighted with pink vertical lines when the Bullish Percent Index has reversed higher to confirm a bullish reversal. The last time we saw the BPI register a confirmed bullish signal was in November 2023, right after the October low. We did not observe any bullish reversals in 2024, as the market uptrend was so strong that the Bullish Percent Index never retreated down to that crucial 30% level. Given the fact that the Bullish Percent Index is finally approaching the 30% threshold, we would expect a decent countertrend rally opportunity if and when the indicator would push below 30% and then once again turn higher. Until that point, we see further downside potential as more S & P 500 stocks register bearish point and figure charts. The deterioration of market breadth indicators going back to the fourth quarter of 2024 has provided a fantastic confirmation of the bearish conditions affecting the major equity averages. Based on our analysis of the latest readings for these breadth indicators, investors may indeed need to brace for further downside for stocks. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

Time to buy the dip in Costco? Here's what the charts say,"Costco (COST) last hit a new all-time high on Feb. 14, a few days before the S & P 500 peaked on Feb. 20. From that high to Tuesday's intraday low, COST has dropped over 14%, compared to the S & P's 10% decline. From both viewpoints, COST has done worse than the market. However, technically speaking, COST has held up better. It has pulled back to a key support zone that has attracted dip buyers since late 2023. Importantly, COST has not undercut its January low or its 200-day moving average — unlike the S & P 500 , which pierced its January low last Thursday and closed below the 200-day on Monday. However, the decline has been harsh enough to trigger COST's first oversold 14-day RSI reading since January 2 — which, notably, marked a key trading low. Each of the biggest drawdowns since October '23 pushed the RSI into the low 30s, and each time, those levels led to successful buying opportunities. So, COST now is short-term oversold in a long-term uptrend. Of course, COST is not alone. Many other stocks now have gotten hit hard over the last three weeks but still are considerably higher than they were two years ago. The big question, then, is what happens if this dip only produces a small bounce (or no bounce at all)? Troubling pattern to watch out for COST, like the broader market, will bounce at some point. But if that bounce is quickly faded, it could result in a lower high — a key technical development. If this happens soon, the chart could begin to take the shape of a major topping pattern. This isn't a prediction, but structurally, it would resemble a bearish head & shoulders formation. Seeing a pattern of this magnitude emerge—especially as COST potentially tests its 200-day moving average — would be an ominous signal, particularly for a stock that has been a perennial leader. The last time COST broke below its 200-DMA after an extended period above it was May 2022 — right in the middle of a sharp two-month downturn. While that decline was painful for COST holders, the stock bottomed in mid-May, five months before the S & P 500 ultimately found its own low in October 2022. COST then flirted with reclaiming its 200-DMA for another 12 months before finally breaking above it for good. Ultimately, COST's 200-DMA breakdown in 2022 signaled a shift from a steady uptrend to a volatile, wide trading range. The silver lining was that even though COST didn't reclaim its all-time, 2022 highs until December 2023, short-term oversold conditions still led to solid buying opportunities along the way. However, traders had to be nimble, as rallies were quickly faded. Bottom line: Buying short-term weakness near key support has historically offered favorable risk-reward set-ups — and that could continue, whether or not COST returns to new highs anytime soon. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

"Trading Palantir as stock market sells off, according to the charts","Just before I left for vacation, I wrote about a possible hedge strategy in the S & P 500 against resistance levels. Since then , the S & P 500 is about 8% lower and we are carrying the hedge. From a technical point of view, I'm watching a possible support zone in the S & P 500 ranging from 5,675-5,400 as we trade right in the middle of that zone — around 5,540. So, we're possibly in the support zone confirmed by diverging market internals that suggests we've reached oversold status. That's despite the severity and pace of the headlines coming from Washington. Based on this analysis, we need to have ready our shopping list of stocks we would like to accumulate should this support zone hold. I ran a scan this morning I call ""20-for-2"". We're looking for at least 20% growth in all of the following: Average EPS and sales growth over the last two quarters Average EPS and sales growth over the last two years Average EPS and sales growth expected over the coming two quarters Market cap greater than $1 billion 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average Based on this scan some familiar names to this column appeared: Duolingo , DoorDash , Hims & Hers Health , Innodata , Nvidia , On Holding , Shopify and Palantir . Palantir is that one that's been playing hard to get in our holdings at Inside Edge Capital. Palantir is demonstrating leadership in the artificial intelligence software platform space and has the top- and bottom-line growth track record to prove it. Palantir is well positioned in the current administration's government efficiency mandate. The weekly chart shows the stock has pulled back more than 30% from the all-time high, which would on the surface be considered a bear market. But context is key, as the stock is up more than 200% in the last 12 months. The 20-week moving average in orange is holding support and looking at the annual and quarterly sale and earnings growth you see a stellar example of 30% growth across all time frames. In 2024, EPS increased 64% from 25 cents in 2023 to 41 cents in 2024. Moving to the daily chart, we see the depth of the pullback relative to the Jan. 13 low. Using Fibonacci restracements, we see the 61.8% retracement attempted to hold as support, but multiple efforts to run stops through this highly visible retracement level resulted in a push down to the 78.6% retracement level. This is what I refer to as the ""retracement of last resort."" If you don't hold this level ($73.34), you're probably heading down to a full 100% retracement, which is a full round trip back to the Jan 13 low. Bottom line, we see this zone in the S & P 500 as an opportunity to take off our short hedges and also deploy cash into strong names like PLTR. The accumulation zone is $82.23-$63.39. The risk on this trade can unfortunately only be determined by you and your financial advisor. How does PLTR fit into your investment horizon, risk tolerance, and financial plan? If it's a short-term trade, I would not want to see the stock below $63. If it's a long-term investment and you're ok buying an AI leader at 35%+ discount and letting it drop a bit lower, position size appropriately such that additional selling would not disproportionately impact your overall portfolio. Personally, and for investors at Inside Edge Capital, we'll be approaching it with the latter approach. -Todd Gordon, founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC DISCLOSURES: Gordon does not own PLTR yet, but intends to add to holdings in the near future and also reserves the right to take no action based on a deterioration of future market conditions.

"S&P 500 correction to deepen, 'Mag 7' names to underperform, according to Katie Stockton","The S & P 500 index shows a significant loss of long-term upside momentum from a technical perspective on its monthly chart. The monthly MACD histogram has ticked lower, and the monthly stochastics are poised for an overbought downturn at the end of the month. The set-up supports a digestion phase for much of 2025, characterized by increased volatility and a sideways-to-lower bias overall. The so-called Magnificent 7 stocks have collectively seen a significant loss of long-term upside momentum in both absolute terms and relative to the S & P 500 (referred to often as 'SPX'), suggesting they will continue to be a source of underperformance this year. The ratio of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) has broken its 200-day moving average. At the same time, there is notable deterioration in market breadth relative to last year, noting only 53% of S & P 500 stocks are above their 200-day moving averages. Zooming in on the weekly bar chart, the S & P 500 is undergoing a correction that we think will deepen in early Q2. This is supported by our weekly indicators, which point decisively lower. We will be watching the weekly stochastics for an upturn from oversold territory to indicate an intermediate-term low, which seems more likely later in Q2. In the near term, the S & P 500 is at a proving ground as it tests support in the 5733-5783 zone, based in part on the 200-day MA. Market sentiment is at bearish extremes per the Fear & Greed Index, which is a potential near-term contrarian positive indication, although price action is more important. If the SPX closes decisively below support this week, it would mark a confirmed breakdown suggesting sentiment can get even more fearful before a meaningful low is established. Secondary support for the SPX is in the 5365-5385 area, based on the cloud model and a Fibonacci retracement level. In a year that is likely to be characterized by heightened volatility, defensive positions and conservative strategies that are characterized by a low beta and low correlation to the SPX hold appeal.

"This Germany ETF has 'years of upside potential,' says chart analyst Cappelleri","As you may have heard, international markets have been leading the global performance landscape in 2025. Of the 45 global ETFs we track closely, 22 are up at least 10% year-to-date, and seven have already gained more than 20%. Those are impressive numbers for an entire year—let alone just a few weeks. The key question now is: Are these moves sustainable? And for investors, is it still a good time to buy? While many ETFs have shown remarkable strength, today we're focusing on the iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG) for two key reasons. First, it's among the top performers, already up over 20% this year. Second, Germany plays a critical role in Europe's economy, financial system, and geopolitical landscape, making it a market worth watching. Before diving in, it's important to note that EWG differs from the local German DAX index because it's priced in U.S. dollars. This means EWG benefits when the dollar weakens — and with the dollar declining for most of 2025, EWG has surged. Looking at EWG's long-term chart, the ETF has blasted through multi-decade resistance and is making new all-time highs in March's early trading sessions. This could mark a major breakout with years of upside potential. In other words, from a big-picture perspective, this setup looks undeniably bullish. It has taken quite a big move in a short amount of time for that breakout to take place. After flirting with its 200-day moving average since reclaiming it in late 2023, EWG finally used it as a launching pad this past December. That rally has continued uninterrupted through early March. In fact, EWG is now 20% above its 200-day moving average — the widest spread since early February 2023. While the ETF is much higher now than it was two years ago, history suggests that such an extreme move can lead to a period of digestion. Back in early 2023, a similar surge eventually lost momentum, with EWG stalling near new highs for months before rolling over in July. It didn't decisively reclaim those February 2023 highs until a full year later, in February 2024. Every situation is different, of course, but the odds of EWG maintaining this pace without some sort of cooling-off period are low. If nothing else, patience is recommended over chasing at these levels. Given all of this, it's no surprise that the EWG vs. S & P 500 ratio has spiked. In fact, its 14-week RSI is now at 80, one of the highest readings in EWG's history. This is an important chart because, more often than not, an overbought RSI in the EWG/SPX ratio has marked a key top. That was the case from late 2007 through early 2023—the very period discussed earlier. The same pattern also played out from 2000 through 2002. The common denominator in both of those periods? The EWG/SPX relative line was in a long-term downtrend. In other words, while EWG occasionally outperformed, those rallies were just mean-reverting moves within a broader decline. However, from 2003 through most of 2007, EWG was in a long uptrend versus the S & P 500. During that stretch, the four overbought RSI readings were actually bullish signals. While short-term pullbacks followed, they produced higher lows, and EWG's relative strength persisted. Bringing it back to today — we expect EWG's pace to slow down, and when it does, its overbought condition relative to the S & P 500 should ease. The key question then becomes: Will buyers step in on the dip, as they did from 2003-2007? If they do, it would be a strong sign that this latest breakout could have years of upside ahead. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https://cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

"Charts show that a recent Amazon sell-off is a big buying opportunity, says Carter Worth","(Check out Carter's worthcharting.com for actionable recommendations and live nightly videos.) Amazon's 19% sell-off from its 52-week high one month ago is seen as a buying opportunity. The stock is in a well-defined uptrend, and uptrends are characterized by countertrends (sell-offs). This pullback, as seen in the charts below, is very similar in terms of magnitude and duration to other countertrend moves in the context of Amazon's ongoing uptrend.

Three defensive plays with good-looking charts as markets shudder,"With the S & P 500 finally breaking below a key support level at 5,850, and the former high-flying ""Magnificent 7"" stocks trading more like the ""Meager 7"" in 2025, where can investors look to ride out this period of market uncertainty? We'll highlight three stocks with three factors in common: they are in defensive sectors that tend to do well during bear market phases, they have a dividend yield higher than the S & P 500, and they are featuring compelling technical profiles. First, let's look to the health care sector, which has actually been the top performing S & P 500 in 2025. While other stocks in the health care sector have experienced stronger gains so far in 2025, we're focused on Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) because it's currently working through a consolidation pattern. This sideways pattern started last October, soon after BMY broke above the $54 resistance level from earlier in 2024. With clear resistance around $61, a break above this price point would mean an upside resolution to this sideways trend, and BMY would then be sitting above two upward-sloping moving averages. With a dividend yield just over 4%, and a price trend close to a breakout point, we could see the powerful combination of strong price performance with a healthy dividend component for this emerging health care name. The second best performing sector in 2025 has been consumer staples, and the tobacco group has shown strong performance going back to mid-2024. While other tobacco names have experienced stronger price action, we see British American Tobacco (BTI) as a compelling option because of its recent downside gap to price support. BTI gapped higher in mid-January to achieve a new 52-week high, and traded just above $42 last month before a gap lower after their quarterly earnings call. The earnings miss pushed BTI down about 13% to its 50-day moving average, which once again held as key price support. This successful test of the 50-day came with an RSI value around 40, confirming that BTI remains in a bullish phase. Given the recent pullback, along with a dividend yield just above 7%, we see this as a compelling chart within a strong sector. Utilities became a growth trade in 2024, driven by the incredible power needs of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. Shares of American Electric Power Co. (AEP) have recently pushed to a new 52-week high while the S & P 500 and Nasdaq have dropped below key support levels, translating to a strong relative performance line at the bottom of the chart. The break above resistance at $102 last month suggested a new uptrend phase after a seven-month consolidation period. AEP now sits above two upward-sloping moving averages, along with strong price momentum, improving relative strength, and a dividend yield around 3.4%. When the broad market indexes show clear signs of fatigue, and the previous leadership names begin to struggle, savvy investors look for stocks demonstrating strong relative strength and a decent dividend yield. These three names in defensive sectors could provide opportunities to outperform amidst a period of market uncertainty. —David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

One group of stocks is off to a hot start this year. How to play it from here,"The insurance industry group is off to a strong start to 2025, with the KBW Insurance index (referred to as the 'KIX') having a year-to-date total return of nearly 10%. This is 8.61% higher than the S & P 500 Index . Intermediate-term momentum is weak for the S & P, and at the same time many insurers have positive technical catalysts on their charts, which differentiates them positively. Outperformance from insurers is likely here to stay in 2025 per the ratio of KIX to the S & P 500, which has a relative breakout confirming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This pattern often signals long-term bullish reversals, meaning that insurers are set up well to continue outperforming the S & P 500 in 2025. An individual stock we found compelling is the The Hartford Insurance Group (HIG) , which cleared initial resistance from its daily cloud model last week. Short-term momentum is to the upside, and there is room to resistance near $123, which goes back to the October peak. The daily stochastics are in short-term overbought territory, but we expect upside momentum to help HIG weather those conditions in the coming days. The rally in HIG has been meaningful enough to shift intermediate-term positive, evident in a bullish weekly MACD crossover. This is the first crossover since August of last year, and it suggests that a corrective phase has matured for HIG. Should HIG clear resistance, it would target an intermediate-term measured move projection of roughly $134. Initial support HIG is now defined by the daily cloud. The top boundary is near $115, but more important support is near the bottom boundary, near $110. This level holds greater significance since it is bolstered by the 50- and 200-day MAs. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

How to trade this retailer using options ahead of earnings this week,"Last October, I highlighted a pair trading opportunity. Long Lululemon (LULU) uses a long call spread, the March 28th weekly $280/$330 call spread, and short Nike (NKE) uses a March 28th $85/$70 put spread. Since that time, LULU has risen nearly 8%, and Nike has fallen roughly 14%. The LULU call spread is close to the maximum achievable profit (the short $330 strike is slightly over 2% out of the money), and the Nike spread has reached the peak achievable profit as the stock is now almost 3% below the lower strike for the put spread. Take profits and close both spreads in the pairs trade now. This is particularly important in the case of Lululemon because while Nike has reported — and the stock fell to lows not seen since 2020 — LULU will be reporting earnings on Thursday. The options market implies that LULU shares could move 10%, higher or lower, by the end of the week between $290 and $355. Most of the potential profits in the call spread have already been made. Why take a risk without potential reward? The question then is what to do now. Nike's earnings results illustrate that CEO Elliott Hill has his work cut out, turning around the athletic apparel and shoe company. While more sell-side analysts have a ""buy"" or ""outperform"" rating than a hold or a sell, several analysts reduced their price targets recently. The current average is 83.50, ~30% lower than a year ago. Lululemon's average price target has also fallen since March 2024. At its highs, it was ~$500 but is now just over $400. What I like about LULU is that Lululemon customers typically represent household incomes of $75,000-$300,000+ and an age range of 15-45, with a sweet spot at 25-34. Affluence and youth combined with a near cult-like loyalty, YoY anticipated sales and earnings growth of > 7%, and forward earnings multiple of less than 21x FY2026 earnings (for the FYE January 31st, 2026) is a very reasonable valuation. That said, Placer.ai data suggests YoY foot traffic is down 7.6% from February to the end of February. Placer.ai generates U.S. foot traffic estimates for retail stores by leveraging a sophisticated combination of mobile location data, advanced data science, and machine learning techniques. Placer.ai starts with a panel of tens of millions of mobile devices across the U.S. (reportedly around 30 million as of earlier statements). This panel is built by aggregating anonymized location data from smartphone apps with user consent to share geolocation information via software development kits (SDKs). These apps span various categories (e.g., weather, gaming, shopping), ensuring a broad population sample. A proprietary catalog of retail store locations, updated with details like store size and type, possibly supplemented by public records or partnerships. LULU 1Y mountain Lululemon, 1-year In fairness, some alternative data contradict this negative assessment. For example, Bloomberg's ""Second Measure"" data estimates observed sales are 3.2% higher YoY (well above the -8.2% YoY sales decline they estimate for the industry more broadly). However, 3.2% is well below the growth of prior years or the broad market. The trade I would, therefore, be more confident picking up LULU shares at a discount to where they're trading now - closer to the prices where LULU was trading back when I recommended it last October. One way to profit from a modest pullback, with the worst-case risk that one buys the shares at a net price of ~ $265, would be by using a zero-cost 1x2 put spread. I was looking at the May 2 weekly $315/$290 1x2 put spread, buying one May $315 put and selling two May $290 puts. Because the May 290s are half the price of the 315s, by selling two of them, the net cost of the trade is essentially zero as/of Friday's closing prices. Even if LULU falls modestly post-earnings, this trade could profit. Of course, if it falls sharply below $290 one would be compelled to purchase the shares at the strike, but because one would realize $25 in profits from the move between $315 and $290, the effective purchase price would be $265 or roughly the lows of Early October 2024. If the shares rally post-earnings, because there was no net outlay of premium, no harm no foul.

How to bet on a market snapback with less risk by using options,"Market sentiment soured quickly this month as investors endured an acute 10% correction in the S & P 500. With $4.6 Trillion in options expiring Friday, I want to approach the S & P 500 with cautious optimism. I am using SPDR S & P 500 ETF (SPY) to obtain upside capture in a possibly counter intuitive retracement higher in U.S. equities. SPY YTD mountain SPDR S & P 500 (SPY), YTD The about-face in equity markets has been attributed to the leadership in the Mag 7 deteriorating or repricing in recent weeks. The current skittishness in markets has been extra painful for investors with heavy tech exposure, specifically those owning Mag 7 stocks: Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple. They are all enduring dramatic declines from their recent highs: Tesla: -50% Nvidia: -25% Alphabet: -22% Amazon: -20% Meta: -20% Microsoft: -19% Apple: -19% Friday's option expiration is extraordinary and unusually massive with nearly $5 trillion of options expiring. Inside of this heavily influenced trading session, I believe the opportunity to retrace and reclaim the 200-day moving average in the S & P 500 exists. I want to define my risk in this option trade as markets will remain vulnerable until we vault over the trade tariff hurdle, supposedly April 2.

Trump administration tries high-wire act to solve debt crisis and not derail economy — how to trade it,"My conjecture is that traders are starting to digest what motivates the administration's DOGE and tariff proposals. And there's a particular trade that could benefit as more realize this: gold. The government's average interest rate on the massive Federal debt is currently 2.78%, but not for long. The problem is that a disproportionate percentage of the debt and carrying the lowest coupons is maturing soon. As the chart below shows, nearly $9 trillion matures this year with an average coupon of 0.9%, $3.8 trillion in 2026 with an average coupon of 2.8%, and $2.7 trillion in 2027 with an average coupon of 3.06%. So, the Federal government must refinance $15.5 trillion in debt by the end of 2027 at substantially higher rates. Additionally, the federal government continues to run a $2 trillion annual deficit. So, interest rates on existing debt will rise, and the debt will continue to rise as a function of the primary budget deficit. Here's a look at the impact on Federal interest expense through YE2027 These are very big numbers, but to put them into context, based on these projections, 2027 interest expense would be about $ $15,000 per taxpayer — just for interest on the Federal debt. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued short-term debt instruments like Treasury bills (T-bills) over longer-term securities during historically low interest rates which created enormous exposure to refinancing risk in the event that interest rates should rise. Aggressive government spending and money printing caused a sharp spike in inflation. By 2022, the Federal Reserve had to begin aggressively raising interest rates. As short-term debt was refinanced at these higher rates, interest expense exploded. With $9 trillion due in 2025, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent must issue new debt to pay off the old. The annual interest expense on this portion jumps from less than $90 billion to nearly $360 billion at 4%—a $270 billion yearly increase on that tranche alone. Flooding the market with new debt to refinance could push yields higher if demand weakens, compounding the problem. Some fear this could strain the Treasury market's capacity, risking a ""rate crisis."" Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, has been warning that this U.S. debt crisis could cause an ""economic heart attack"" within the next three years. The prior administration's unusual means of funding the government lit a stick of dynamite in the Federal budget, and the current administration must try to defuse it. There's an immediate need to make aggressive spending cuts to help offset sharply rising interest expenses resulting from the prior administration's funding mistakes and a need to raise revenue without cratering the economy. This isn't only because cutting government spending tends to inflame those who are cut, but because government spending is one of the inputs in the GDP formula (but not government interest expense). GDP = C (private consumption) + I (business expenditures) + G (government spending) + NX (net exports). To get to a sustainable fiscal condition, a 3% deficit according to Bessent, in addition to aggressive spending cuts, the government needs to raise revenue, but the administration cannot raise taxes nationally because the Constitution grants Congress the power to set taxes, regulate commerce, raise revenue, and impose import tariffs but Congress enacted statutes in 1930, 1962, 1974, and 1977 granting authority to the President to impose tariffs. Increasing tariffs is among the few revenue-enhancing powers the Executive branch has, but if you look at the GDP formula you'll notice net exports is also an input. If increasing tariffs reduces the trade deficit, that would be a potential offset to the negative GDP consequences of cutting government spending. We currently import ~ $4.1 trillion in goods annually and export perhaps $3.3 trillion or so. Assuming tariff increases reduced those imports to $3.5 trillion and raised $350 billion in tariff revenue, even if exports fell 5%, the trade imbalance would shrink $435 billion, helping GDP in addition to the tariff revenues helping the budget. If you don't believe the administration is trying to thread the needle of raising revenues, cutting spending, and maintaining sentiment with policies that help support GDP, look no further than Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's comments on March 2nd when he said, ""They count government spending as part of GDP. So I'm going to separate those two and make it transparent."" We might liken the administration's predicament to riding a unicycle across a high-wire while juggling during an earthquake while half the audience is throwing rotten fruit at them. I'm not even sure it's possible. What must one do if both parties fail to recognize the urgent need to reduce the deficit and hedge against the risk that the current efforts devolve into inconsequential spending cuts, inconsequential decreases in trade imbalances, inconsequential boosts to growth in the ""real"" (productive) economy and instead we experience the ""shocking"" developments Ray Dalio describes as ""imminent"" if we don't act? The trade Some folks are betting on this eventuality by purchasing precious metals. Gold recently breached $3,000/oz for the first time. In other debt crises in history, the local currency has often been significantly devalued. Gold has risen ~90% since the 2022 lows, as has silver and the miners, and there's a strong case for each. @GC.1 1Y mountain Gold futures, 1 year One way to play this with options is with calendar spreads. For example, one could buy a January 2026, slightly in-the-money 45 strike call in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) for about $5.90, or 13% of the underlying stock (ETF) price, and sell a nearer-dated April 25th weekly 50 strike call against it for ~$.50. Those willing to purchase GDX at a slightly lower price could supplement the premium collected by also selling a downside April 25th weekly 41.5 strike put for ~$.46. The premium on the ""short strangle"" in late April would offset 16% of the premium associated with the purchase of the longer-dated call. However, it does take on greater risk and capital requirements than the simple call diagonal would. If you've made it this far, you've absorbed a lot, but understanding the mechanics beneath the surface may make the things we see a bit more comprehensible, even if that understanding isn't particularly comforting.

A stock poised to break out as copper prices climb — How to play it,"Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is set for a potential breakout as copper prices approach their 52-week highs, driving renewed interest in the largest global copper mining company. FCX, which generates most of its revenue from copper, is starting to outperform both the S & P 500 and its sector, signaling a bearish-to-bullish turnaround. The company's recent earnings beat analyst expectations, reflecting strong operational performance and record production levels. FCX's focus on innovation, including AI-driven technologies in its mining operations, positions it to meet rising global demand for copper, particularly in electronics and renewable energy sectors. With strong forward guidance for FY2025, FCX offers a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to copper's rally. @HG.1 1Y mountain Copper futures, 1 year If we review a chart, FCX is approaching a critical $39-$40 resistance level, with increasing momentum as copper prices break out above its $4.80 resistance towards its 52-week highs. FCX's outperformance relative to the S & P 500 and its sector, combined with positive momentum, suggests a potential breakout, targeting $50 to the upside as the bearish trend reverses into a bullish phase. Bullish Thesis: Copper Strength: Copper prices approaching 52-week highs reflect strong global demand, particularly in electronics and renewable energy, benefiting FCX, which derives 72% of its revenue from copper. Operational Excellence: FCX's Q4 FY2024 earnings showed $6.5 billion in revenue and an EPS of $0.50, beating estimates, with record production and AI-driven innovations enhancing efficiency. Positive Outlook: Forward guidance for FY2025 revenue at $25-$26 billion and a consistently positive outlook in its growth trajectory, supported by global copper demand. The trade To capitalize on FCX's breakout potential, I'm suggesting a bull call spread that can capture the upside with a strong risk to reward ratio and limited risk. Buy the May 16, 2025 $40/47 Call Vertical @ $2.10 Debit. This entails: Buying the May 16, 2025 $40 Call @ $2.73 Selling the May 16, 2025 $47 Call @ $0.63 The maximum reward is $490 if FCX is above $47 at expiration. The maximum risk is $210 if FCX is below $40 at expiration.

Using options as a less risky way to bet on a comeback in a beaten-up tech leader,"Markets have been rattled by a sharp three-week correction since February 19, with the Nasdaq bearing the brunt of the decline, dropping 14%. While corrections can be painful, they serve an important purpose —resetting valuations, bringing stocks back to more reasonable levels, and laying the foundation for the next bull run. Two weeks ago, I shared a trade set-up on QQQ , the ETF that closely tracks the Nasdaq's price movement. In that post, I highlighted key signals to watch for the correction's end. Looking at the same chart now, the MACD crossover I previously pointed out has occurred, signaling that the worst of the sell-off may be behind us and the market could be shifting toward a recovery. While many tech stocks are following a similar pattern, the stock I've selected for this trade is Salesforce (CRM) . Like the broader sector, CRM was caught in the sell-off, tumbling an eye-popping 26% in just 43 days. However, just like QQQ, CRM is now showing early signs of a turnaround. For this trade set-up, I'm relying on two key technical indicators: RSI (Relative Strength Index): When RSI falls below 30, it indicates oversold conditions, often leading traders to watch for a potential reversal. In CRM's case, RSI dropped below 30 between Feb. 26 and March 12 before rebounding, suggesting that the stock may be in the early stages of a turnaround. MACD: Another reliable tool for spotting potential market reversals is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator. While the standard MACD settings (12,26,9) are commonly used, they often lag, generating signals after the market has already moved. To improve responsiveness, I've adjusted the settings to (5,13,5). A MACD crossover occurs when the blue MACD line crosses above the yellow signal line, signaling an early trend reversal—and that's exactly what we're seeing on CRM's chart. The Trade Setup: To take a bullish trade on CRM, I'm implementing a bull call spread strategy. With CRM trading around $281, I'm structuring the trade by buying a $280 call and selling a $285 call as a single unit. If CRM closes at or above $285 by April 11th, this trade will yield a 100% return on the capital risked. This setup provides a way to capitalize on a potential bounce while maintaining a defined risk-reward structure. With 10 contracts, this equates to risking $2500 to potentially gain $2500. Here is my exact trade setup: Buy $280 call, April 11th expiry Sell $285 call, April 11th expiry Cost: $250 Potential Profit: $250 Setups like this are detailed extensively in my book, Mean Reversion Trading, available here: https://25k.link/book You can find more similar trade setups and analysis on my website . -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradingextremes.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading Youtube, Twitter: @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: (Nishant has a CRM 280-285 call spread expiring on 4/11/2025.)

Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy is outperforming the crypto market. How to profit if it reverts back,"Heralded as the flagship cryptocurrency, bitcoin disrupts traditional finance as a decentralized, borderless currency immune to government control or inflation. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins — capped by code — positions it as ""digital gold,"" a hedge against fiat currency devaluation, especially as global debt rises and central banks print money. Adoption is growing: institutional investors like MicroStrategy (now known as Strategy) and Tesla have bought in, and countries like El Salvador made it legal tender in 2021. With unmatched network security, the blockchain's hash rate hitting all-time highs in 2025, making it nearly impossible to attack. (The hash rate refers to the computational power used to process and secure transactions on a blockchain network. The higher the hash rate, the more computational effort is needed to alter the blockchain.) The greater the hash rate, the more resistant the network is to attack by malicious actors. Plus, transaction volume keeps climbing, signaling real-world use. Thus, bitcoin possesses key attributes for use as money: scarcity, utility, and trust, which are not subject to government manipulation. Bitcoin's bullish narrative hasn't translated to its price lately, and this bearish outlook extends to MicroStrategy (MSTR) , a company whose aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy has tied its fate inextricably to the cryptocurrency's performance. Microstrategy was the second-best performing stock in the Russell 1000 in 2024, with a total return of 358.5% trailing only high-flying AppLovin. That eye-opening performance was roughly triple the performance of bitcoin itself , a function of the fact that MicroStrategy uses financial leverage (borrows money) to purchase bitcoin and the fact that investors were willing to award the company a premium to the value of bitcoin the company held on its balance sheet. BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin, 1 year Under Michael Saylor's leadership, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a bitcoin proxy by amassing a staggering number of BTC on its balance sheet, more than 499,000 as I write this, which is almost 2.4% of all the bitcoin that could ever be mined. While this strategy initially paid off during bitcoin's bull runs, it now leaves the company vulnerable to the cryptocurrency's downturns. MicroStrategy's stock price has become a leveraged bet on bitcoin, amplifying gains and losses. As bitcoin's price faces downward pressure, MicroStrategy's valuation will likely suffer disproportionately. But so far this year, it hasn't. Since Dec. 31 spot bitcoin has declined, but Microstrategy is outperforming both the cryptocurrency and the broad market, with a YTD total return of ~2.7%. As of Friday, March 14th, 2024, Microstrategy's 499,096 bitcoin were worth almost $42 billion, but the company's market cap was $77.4 billion, and the company's enterprise value, which captures net debt (remember debt holders are senior in the cap structure) was $84.6 billion. Effectively the company is trading for 2x the value of the bitcoin on the company's balance sheet. MSTR YTD mountain MicroStrategy (Strategy), YTD Investors give Microstrategy and CEO Michael Saylor a substantial premium to the value they assign to the cryptocurrency to which they've tied their future. While I believe in bitcoin's utility, and I'm impressed by Michael Saylor's conviction and financial creativity, I also recognize that Microstrategy's downside risk is greater than that of bitcoin itself. 1) The company has borrowed money to purchase Bitcoin, which introduces leverage. 2) The premium the stock holds to the cryptocurrency could evaporate. It's unlikely to trade at a significant discount to bitcoin net of debt — put differently, I do not expect Microstrategy to trade at a meaningful discount to book value. Still, it certainly could revert closer to it. 3) bitcoin itself has been under some pressure lately, and if Microstrategy merely ""caught up"" to the year-to-date decline it would be down ~30%. The trade A June $250/$200 1x2 put spread, where one would purchase one June $250 put (currently trading ~ $30/contract) and sell two June $200 puts (currently just under $15/contract), one would risk little if Microstrategy's outperformance continues to the upside. As of June expiration, if the stock fell between $150 and $250 one would see profits, with peak profits of $50/share achieved at the $200 short strike price. The risk is that because one is short two puts for every one held long, the holder of this position could be forced to buy the shares at that $200 strike price. Still, net of the profits on the $250 strike puts, the effective purchase price would be $150/share, or very close to the company's current book value based on their current bitcoin holdings.

50% declines are commonplace for Tesla shares. How to trade the stock from here,"Tesla (TSLA) , the electric vehicle giant led by Elon Musk, has long been a darling of investors seeking growth in the innovative technology and sustainable energy sectors. However, a recent sharp pullback in high-flying tech stocks has particularly hit Tesla shares. Tesla's stock price declined by approximately 50% from its peak. While this drop might alarm some investors, it presents a compelling opportunity for others. Now could be an opportune moment to consider buying Tesla shares. Tesla's stock has historically been volatile, with significant peaks and troughs driven by market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and company-specific developments. The recent drop — while notable — has happened before: 2016, 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2024 also saw drops of about 50% or more. The company remains a leader in the EV market, which is projected to grow exponentially as governments worldwide push for carbon neutrality and consumers increasingly adopt sustainable transportation. According to industry forecasts, the global EV market could reach a valuation of over $1 trillion by 2030 and Tesla is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth. Of course, EVs cannot be the only reason to buy the shares. The company's enterprise value, even net of the significant decline, is ~$ $775 billion as of today's close. Therefore, the valuation is more than three-quarters of estimates for the entire industry five years from now. What you're buying To believe the shares will rise, one must also see value in other future revenue streams and innovation, and Tesla has some good ones. For example, Tesla is diversifying into energy storage (Powerwall, Megapack), solar energy (Solar Roof), and artificial intelligence (AI) with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The FSD suite, in particular, could become a game-changer, potentially generating recurring software revenue akin to a subscription model—something analysts estimate could add billions to Tesla's top line in the coming years and is critical to the rollout of the company's promised robotaxi. While promising, Tesla's expansion into high-growth markets like China and India could face considerable competition. China-based BYD (Beyond Your Dreams) offers competitive EVs at even more competitive prices. That said, Tesla's new factory openings (e.g., the continued scaling of Shanghai Gigafactory) have strengthened its global footprint. Politics risk Elon Musk's leadership is a polarizing yet undeniable factor in Tesla's appeal for many. His unconventional style and ventures (e.g., X Corp, SpaceX) and track record of turning ambitious ideas into reality is remarkable. Historically, his efforts to advance more climate-friendly technologies, his socially liberal stances, and his entrepreneurship positioned him as a likable iconoclast by broad swathes of the population. However, more recently he has recognized that the federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path and joined the Trump administration as the head of the newly founded Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to root out government waste, fraud and abuse aggressively. While the need to do this has been repeated over the years by prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle, the effort has drawn out polemicists. President Trump is a polarizing figure, demonized in some quarters as is anyone who aligns themselves with him as Elon Musk has. Given his position as the CEO of a large publicly traded company whose products are everywhere and recognizable, alienating a portion of the population carries significant risks not just for Musk, but for all Tesla stakeholders including employees, shareholders and those who simply bought their cars. At best some folks who wouldn't usually concern themselves much with the political views of corporate management now refuse to buy Tesla cars merely because they don't like the CEO - one assumes they give little thought to the other stakeholders such as employees and shareholders. For example, the Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America owns 13.1mm shares, and has seen a > $3 billion decline in the value of their shares. The public employee pensions of California and New York are also large shareholders. At worst, it has prompted criminal behavior as those opposed to cutting government spending have vandalized Teslas, in some cases setting them on fire. In the Bay Area, where we live, posters denouncing Musk and Tesla cars hang on telephone and light poles. Tesla owners preemptively put bumper stickers on their vehicles to distance themselves from the company's CEO. We recently parked behind a Tesla with a bumper sticker that said, ""I bought it before we knew Elon was crazy."" Doubting that a bumper sticker would placate anyone who wanted to protect government waste and vandalize strangers' cars, we didn't put one on ours. However, my wife has told me that she's received unsolicited diatribes from strangers about Elon when they've seen her Tesla, and she has on a couple of occasions made a point to park it out of sight, which speaks to the tension this is causing. Baird analyst Ben Kallo said on Squawk on the Street "" When people's cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent might think twice about buying a Tesla. "" The trade I suspect the stock could remain volatile, but I also believe there are levels at which it could find a floor. Tesla deserves a meaningful premium due to its leadership position in the space, best-in-class technology, and significant lead in data, which will be hugely important as FSD becomes mainstream and as robotaxis goes from science fiction to an everyday reality. The consensus is that the company will earn ~ $3.86/share in FY 2026, representing YoY growth of about 35%, according to Bloomberg data. At a PEG ratio of 1 that works out to ~$135 share. Throw a 25% premium for the company's apex position gets us to ~$168/share as a base case valuation. An April 25th 225/195 1x2 put spread can be put on for about even money as of today's closing prices. Buying one April 225 put for $14.95 and selling two 195s against it for $7.10 each (a small net debit). This trade will essentially break even at any price above $225. If Tesla shares fall further, it will see profits of up to $30 if $TSLA falls to $195 as of April 25th expiration. Below that, profits will decline because the position holder is short two $195 puts for every $225 they own. Still, the downside risk is, effectively, that one would own the shares at $165, a more than 30% discount to the current share price and very close to the $168 valuation I previously identified while profiting from more potential pressure.

An options trade to bet on a possible Nvidia rebound,"As the market sell-off deepens, the Nasdaq has now endured a 14% correction in the last three weeks. Corrections are a natural part of market cycles, allowing valuations to reset and paving the way for a healthier bull market. Even the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks haven't been spared, including Nvidia , which has plunged more than 25% from its highs despite beating earnings expectations. Like many other stocks trading at a steep discount, this sharp decline appears overdone, presenting a potential buying opportunity that could materialize in the coming days. While oversold conditions create buying opportunities, the challenge lies in timing the dip correctly—and technical analysis can provide valuable insights. Below is a one-year daily chart of NVDA, where I'm tracking two key technical indicators for a potential trade setup: 10, 21, 34 EMAs (blue, yellow, and pink lines) - As long as these EMAs are pointing down, the downtrend remains intact, signaling that the sell-off isn't over yet. MACD – The MACD line and signal line help identify trend reversals. A crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, signaling a shift in momentum. Since MACD is a lagging indicator, I've adjusted the settings to 5,13,5 instead of the traditional 12,26,9, allowing for a faster signal. At the time of writing, neither the EMAs are turning upward nor has the MACD crossover occurred. This means, if one wants to play safe, it's a waiting game for now. However, with the tech sector primed for a sharp rebound, this trade could shape up in the coming days. The Trade Setup: NVDA bull call Spread To initiate a bullish position on NVDA, I am using an options strategy known as a ""bull call spread."" To construct this trade, I need to buy an at-the-money (ATM) call option and simultaneously selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option as part of the same trade. Here is an example trade setup assuming NVDA is trading at $115/share after market open. Buy $115 call, April 11 expiry Sell $116 call, April 11 expiry Cost: $50 Potential Profit: $50 Notes: Strike selection : Strikes will depend on NVDA's price at the time one is looking to enter the trade. The long call should be ATM, and the short call should be OTM, thereby allowing one to construct this bull call spread. Expiration : It is best to give these trades 24-35 days to play out in your favor, especially when dealing with deep corrections like the one we have just experienced. Profit target : If NVDA trades at or above the short strike by the expiration date, this trade will yield a return of 100% on the amount risked. With 50 contracts, this equates to risking $2,500 to potentially gain $2,500. go into many setups like these in my book, Mean Reversion Trading, available here .

The Apple bear case is still in place. Here's an options trade to capitalize on further downside,"I recently laid out a bearish thesis on Apple, which has played out as anticipated, with the stock pulling back and the April 4, 2025 $245/260 Call Vertical collecting over 70% of the maximum profit. However, AAPL continues to face significant headwinds that reinforce our bearish outlook. As consumer brands sour on their 2025 outlook, AAPL's lackluster iPhone 16 sales confirms a more selective consumer base. Additionally, competition in augmented reality from rivals like Meta Platforms and Snap continues to challenge the commercialization of Apple's Vision Pro future. Lastly, AAPL's progress in artificial intelligence remains underwhelming, with the Apple Intelligence trailing competitors like META, Microsoft and xAI — who are setting the pace in AI innovation. With this, AAPL's valuation remains hard to justify given growth metrics that lack optimism. As these challenges persist, we are taking profits on our trade and rolling our credit spread to seek further bearish exposure and re-center our position. The chart of AAPL continues to support our bearish view, as AAPL has underperformed the S & P 500 since its December peak, forming a pattern of lower lows and lower highs. This indicates ongoing weakness and potential for further correction to its next major level of support around $200. AAPL's valuation remains my primary concern, trading at an 83% premium relative to its peers, despite growth metrics that are only in line with industry standards. While its superior profitability has historically supported a premium, the recent slowdown in revenue, EPS growth and consumer spending trends introduces significant downside risk: Forward PE ratio: 33x vs. industry median of 18x Expected EPS growth: 11% vs. industry median 13% Expected revenue growth: 6% vs. industry median 6% Net Margins: 24% vs. Industry Median 8% Warning signs: Disappointing iPhone 16 Sales: AAPL continues to struggle with underwhelming iPhone 16 sales, reflecting a more selective consumer base. AR competition: Rivals like META and SNAP are intensifying competition in augmented reality, putting pressure on AAPL's Vision Pro future. AI shortfalls: Apple's Apple Intelligence has failed to deliver meaningful advancements, lagging behind competitors in AI. China's economic slowdown: The economic downturn in China, a critical market, continues to dampen AAPL's sales growth. To maintain our bearish exposure, we're rolling our credit spread to a lower strike with a call credit spread: Sell the April 25, 2025 $230/245 Call Vertical @ $5.85 Credit. This entails: Selling the April 25, 2025 $230 call @ $9.48 Buying the April 25, 2025 $245 call @ $3.63 The maximum reward is $585 if AAPL is below $230 at expiration. The maximum risk is $915 if AAPL rises above $245 at expiration. The breakeven point for this trade is $235.85. View this Trade with Updated Prices at OptionsPlay . This adjusted call vertical strategy re-centers our bearish position, leveraging AAPL's continued technical weakness and overvaluation to capture further downside potential. With persistent headwinds and a lack of immediate catalysts, this trade aligns with our bearish thesis, offering a way to profit from a further potential pullback with defined risk.

"A way to capitalize on a potential decline in inflation, using options","Government waste can contribute to higher costs and inflation in several ways. Fraud and abuse act like a tax on the system. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates improper payments cost taxpayers between $233 billion and $521 billion annually — more than $3 trillion since 2003. This money gets siphoned off, reducing funds for legitimate needs or increasing borrowing, fueling inflation by injecting cash without corresponding output. A large government footprint, often measured by federal spending as a percentage of GDP (around 24% in 2023), competes with the private sector for labor, capital and resources. This competition can lead to a phenomenon known as ""crowding out,"" where government hiring workers or borrowing reduces the availability of these resources for private investment. Less private sector innovation and production mean slower supply growth which, paired with sustained demand, drives inflation. The federal workforce (excluding the military) has hovered around 2.1 million civilian employees, and government employee compensation is higher than the private sector on average, raising overall labor costs. Compounding these issues, the government relies heavily on deficit spending. The fiscal deficit 2024 exceeded $2 trillion, or 6.86% of US GDP. When financed by borrowing, this can pressure the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low or buy bonds (quantitative easing), expanding the money supply. Too much money chasing too few goods is a classic inflation recipe. The M2 money supply grew by over 25% from 2020-2022 during pandemic spending, a spike that correlated with the 9.1% peak inflation in June 2022. A larger government leads to additional regulation, adding compliance costs that businesses pass on to consumers. The Competitive Enterprise Institute pegs the annual cost of federal regulations at 8% of GDP, again stifling productivity and raising prices, as firms must spend more time and money on lawyers and paperwork and less on innovation or expansion. The problem is that, while it's clear that government waste is inefficient, it still involves expenditures that inject money into the economy. Aggressive cost cutting could reduce aggregate demand, as businesses and workers tied to that spending lose income, lowering GDP. The psychological impact could compound this. Job resignations have slowed as workers perceive (and data supports) getting another job is more challenging. Massive government layoffs will likely increase the anxiety of the labor force, and government spending also props up specific industries (e.g., defense, infrastructure) and many nonprofits. Even if these payments are inappropriate, ending them could destabilize the recipients and others downstream if they have little time to adjust. Many hope fiscal cuts may be offset by easing monetary policy, possibly rate cuts, in the short term. That's why this week's consumer price index data is so important. While the Fed may wait to see the PCE data later in the month, CPI will likely serve as a bellwether. TLT 1Y mountain TLT one-year chart My take is that the disinflationary impact of slackening consumer demand will begin to rein in inflation, but those impacts may not be reflected in the CPI data this week. Consequently, I want to take a longer-term bullish position in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) but sell a nearer-dated strangle against it to help finance the cost as follows: Buy June 30 $92 call Sell April 25 $95 call Sell April 25 $86.50 put DISCLOSURES.

Tariff uncertainty has created a buying opportunity. How to use options to capitalize,"Investor sentiment has drastically changed in recent weeks as tariffs — or the threat of tariffs — have been introduced to the markets. Last month's discussion of awakening animal spirits and multiple analysts racing to readjust their 2025 S & P 500 targets served as a warning, as the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) crashed under 15. The Invesco QQQ Trust , which tracks the Nasdaq-100, and the S & P 500 have been dropping precipitously — even dipping under their 200 day moving averages for the first time in roughly 400 trading days. I believe now is the time to add U.S. equity exposure. I want to use options to potentially establish a long position and capture a snap back in the SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) in this newly elevated volatility landscape. Per friends at Bespoke Investment Group: The average U.S. stock is now 30% below its 52-week high, which on average was made on Sept. 21. I do not believe market fundamentals have changed despite the uncertainty of tariffs dominating the daily headlines. One interesting component of the market that should serve as a shock absorber once tariffs are hashed out is the move lower in interest rates. The 10-year note dropped from its recent high of 4.8% down to 4.12% earlier this week. This coupled with a weakening dollar should fuel equities higher once investors digest the ultimate status of tariffs. The last bit of optimism is crude oil prices have tucked down into the 60's, this should help lower inflation. An old adage I learned in my years of pit trading in Chicago is to ""be greedy when others are fearful"" and conversely ""be fearful when others are greedy."" I believe the recent injection of market uncertainty, which has produced some significant investor fear, presents opportunity. An investor has to be on board with owning the market in this options trade, as there is risk of being put to a long position in SPY. However, by using a risk reversal an investor has the ability to finance the upside call which will become profitable in the event the March Madness subsides, and equities resume their trajectory inside of this bull market. The trade Sold the 3/28/2025 $560 put for $8.00 Bought the 3/28/2025 $580 call for $7.80 This risk reversal will allow an investor to collect $0.20 or $20 per one spread This was filled when SPY was roughly trading $571.50 An investor will sell a cash-covered put at $560 and will own SPY at $559.80 in the event SPY is below that price upon expiration. An investor potentially is long SPY above $579.80 looking to capture unlimited upside profitability. DISCLOSURES: Kilburg owns the spread and is short $570 SPY puts as well. He is also long SPY.

A market hedge traders use if volatility spikes and the sell-off gets worse,"The Cboe Volatility Index (known as the ""VIX"") measures the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 days as implied by a weighted strip of S & P 500 Index options. When investors are nervous, options premiums, and therefore the VIX tends to spike, reflecting heightened uncertainty. A very high reading often signals panic or extreme fear. Such spikes sometimes suggest that the market may have overreacted, potentially offering buying opportunities. The problem with using the VIX alone as a buy or a sell signal is that while sometimes fears are overblown, sometimes they're not. For example, during the so-called ""Taper Tantrum"" in 2018, in the first 10 days of October the S & P 500 fell more than 6.7% while the VIX more than doubled from ~12 to ~25. . However, that did not prove to be an exceptional buying opportunity, the S & P lost almost another 14% through the lows that December. .VIX 5Y mountain Cboe Volatility Index, 5 years A VIX level in the 20s suggests the market is fearful but does not indicate panic. The VIX around 22 is approximately the 72nd percentile — above average but not extreme. So what constitutes extreme? To give VIX levels some context, I broke it into deciles. In the chart below, along the x-axis are the respective deciles. 0-10 is the lowest decile - the bucket with the lowest 10% of all VIX observations and 90-100 is the top decile, the highest 10% of all VIX observations. The columns represent the average return over the subsequent 30 days. So when the market is extremely complacent, the bottom decile, the average 30 day return looking forward is .72%. The second decile average return is .8% and so on. As of Wednesday's close, the VIX was at the 71.5%ile for all data, the decile represented by 70-80 along the x-axis in the chart. As you can see, the average return for the S & P 500 over the subsequent 30 days is anemic .07%, and well below the 30-day average return for all data of .81% (the straight blue line). That ""bucket"" represents VIX levels between 21.59 and 24.28. Does that mean the market will have below-average returns over the next 30 days? Not necessarily, but it's a dangerous area when considering a couple of other factors. One issue is valuation. While valuation is not a market timing tool, well-above-average valuations present additional risk. The S & P 500 is trading at a 25-30% premium to the average forward earnings multiple over the past 35 years. Second, the VIX is trading at a ~25% premium to the average over the past 30 days. Why does this matter? Volatility is a mean-reverting process, that is, it is much higher than the average of the past month suggests it is currently moving away from the mean, whereas if the prior 30 day average VIX level was higher than the current level it would indicate it is moving back towards the mean. Incorporating those additional factors where the current VIX level is above the rolling 30-day average, and the forward PE is above 18, the average returns over the subsequent 30 days is -.73% This type of data analysis can be sketchy because the more filters one imposes, the sparser the dataset becomes. In 35 years, only 219 trading days, or 2.47% of the data, meet these criteria. The trade If you're concerned that the rising VIX is a sign that things could get worse before they get better, a hedge might help you avoid the panic, if that's what's coming. Using SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a portfolio proxy, one could construct a ""zero-cost put spread collar."" This collar is so named because the objective is that the premium collected from selling an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the-money call will offset the cost of purchasing a closer-to-at-the-money put.

A China play that's cheap and has little risk from the trade war — How to play it with options,"As a trade war with China escalates, Baidu Inc. (BIDU) stands out as an opportunity to gain exposure to a global leader in AI at a compelling valuation, with minimal risks from tariffs. As China's leading search engine, BIDU has evolved into a powerhouse in AI innovation, with initiatives like the Ernie Bot chatbot, Baidu AI Cloud, and autonomous driving projects gaining significant traction. These efforts position BIDU to capitalize on China's aggressive push to compete globally in AI, supported by recent deregulation that is unlocking value for Chinese tech firms. BIDU's AI Cloud reported 26% growth in Q4 2024, and its venture capital fund for AI startups emphasizes its commitment to leading this space. Trading at a significant discount to its industry, BIDU offers an attractive risk to reward for investors seeking exposure to the AI revolution with a long-term growth horizon. Using the chart If we examine the chart, BIDU made a new 52-week low at the beginning of 2025 which started to show exhaustion from sellers. Since then, the stock has made a series of higher highs and higher lows, suggesting that the multi-year downtrend is potentially starting to reverse in the other direction. Lastly, the recent pullback to its $84 support level provides an attractive risk to reward entry point in this directional shift with an upside target of $150. Looking at the business, BIDU trades at a significant discount to its industry, despite EPS growth and profitability metrics that are in line with or exceed industry averages. China's deregulatory push and BIDU's leadership in AI further enhance its investment case. Forward PE Ratio: 8.51x vs. Industry Average 20.89x Expected EPS Growth: 12.85% vs. Industry Average 14.43% Net Margins: 17.88% vs. Industry Average 7.89% BIDU's AI Leadership: AI Leadership: BIDU's AI initiatives, including the Ernie (handling 1.65 billion API daily requests last quarter), Baidu AI Cloud (26% growth in Q4 2024), and Baidu Apollo (leader in smart transportation), position it at the forefront of China's AI ambitions. Deregulatory Tailwinds: China's recent relaxation of tech regulations is unlocking value for BIDU, allowing it to focus on innovation and growth. Investment in AI Ecosystem: BIDU's $145M venture capital fund for AI startups and up to $2B investment in biotech highlights its commitment to expanding its AI and tech footprint. The trade To capitalize on BIDU's long-term growth potential, I'm suggesting that we use a cash secured put to generate income as a stock acquisition strategy. This entails selling the Apr 4, $85 Put @ $3.20 Credit. This strategy involves selling the April 4, 2025 $85 put, collecting $320 in premium per contract. The maximum reward is $320 if BIDU is above $85 at expiration. This strategy carries the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a net price of $81.80 if BIDU closes below $85 at expiration, offering a 3.91% discount to the current price. View this Trade with Updated Prices at OptionsPlay This strategy positions you to potentially acquire BIDU shares at a discounted price for a long-term play, while collecting premium income if the stock remains above $85. With BIDU's robust AI exposure, technical breakout, and undervalued fundamentals, this cash-secured put offers a strategic way to gain exposure to a leader in China's AI revolution with lower risk using options.

A way to bet on a tech stock bounce with less risk using options,"Markets have been under significant pressure since February 19, with the tech sector leading the decline. The one-year daily chart of the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) illustrates this pullback. Despite the current sell-off, we remain in a bull market, and it's well known among market technicians that the 200-day moving average serves as a strong long-term support in such conditions. Notably, during the last two visits to this level, QQQ experienced sharp rebounds, and we are seeing similar price action again. With QQQ approaching the 200-day exponential, it could be setting up for another bounce. One effective way to identify potential market reversals is by using the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator. The standard MACD settings (12,26,9) are widely used, but they tend to lag, generating signals slightly after the market moves. To make MACD more responsive, I've adjusted the settings to (5,13,5). In the chart below, the blue line represents the MACD line, while the yellow line is the signal line. I've also highlighted past instances where a MACD crossover (when the blue line crosses above the signal line) has effectively signaled the end of pullbacks or corrections. While this crossover hasn't occurred yet, it could happen as soon as next week, making it an important signal to watch for this potential trade setup. These setups are detailed extensively in my book, Mean Reversion Trading, available here: https://25k.link/book You can also find hundreds of similar examples on my website: https://tradingextremes.com The trade: QQQ 490-491 bull call spread To take a bullish position on QQQ, I'm utilizing a bull call spread. With QQQ trading around $488, this setup involves buying a slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) $490 call and selling a further ORM $491 call as a single unit. As QQQ moves, one can scale into the position by adding multiple spreads. For example, if QQQ dips to 480, a 483-484 spread could be added to take advantage of the price move. Here is my exact trade setup: Buy $490 call, April 11th expiry Sell $491 call, April 11th expiry Cost: $50 Potential Profit: $50 If QQQ reaches or exceeds the short strike ($491) by expiration, this trade has the potential to return 100% on the capital risked. For instance, with 10 contracts, the trade involves risking $500 to potentially gain $500. As QQQ rebounds, traders can ladder into the position, gradually increasing exposure to capitalize on these rare pullbacks in the indices. -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradingextremes.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading Youtube, Twitter: @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

A bitcoin trade using options if Trump's reserve puts a floor under crypto,"Through Friday, bitcoin had fallen 28% from its intraday highs on January 20th. This swoon mirrored the post-election rally between early November and mid-December, when the crypto trade soared on hopes that the incoming administration and a Republican Congress would establish a crypto strategic reserve, an idea he floated during his second Presidential campaign. However, the flurry of executive orders, President Donald Trump signed over 70 within a month of the inauguration, did not include the hoped-for reserve. That combined with some mixed inflation data, mediocre consumer data, and sales guidance from the likes of Walmart, and a bumpy road in the AI trade after the provocative DeepSeek and Alibaba LLM announcements during the Chinese New Year caused a negative investor sentiment shift which hit the crypto complex hard. Bitcoin maverick Michael Saylor's company Microstrategy fell more than 56% from the peak through Friday in the sell-off. However, the space rebounded sharply over the weekend after President Trump posted on Truth Social that the administration is moving forward on a ""Crypto Strategic Reserve,"" anchored by BTC and ETH , including XRP, SOL, and ADA. This rebound brings a resurgent hope for the future of the cryptocurrency space. Analyzing crypto Cryptocurrencies tend to be volatile and sensitive to investors' general risk appetite in the short term. However, fundamental drivers will drive them long-term, including adoption and a supportive regulatory environment. This announcement confirms that the new administration is taking a very different stance on crypto from the previous one. It can feel overwhelming for those interested in getting involved. Which cryptocurrency? Can they trust the crypto wallet platforms? Should they self-custody? Stories of hacks, thefts, scamcoins, and the discomfort of opening new accounts on unfamiliar platforms may discourage participants who otherwise believe in the technology and see a broader, legal role for cryptocurrencies in the future. Michael Saylor's company, now called Strategy (MSTR) , exposes investors to bitcoin, but the business's capital structure does confuse some people. The company issues debt to purchase Bitcoin, which introduces leverage, and its market capitalization exceeds the book value of the Bitcoin held less debt. Additionally, the bonds the company has issued are convertible, meaning that some of the potential future upside in the shares, if any, would belong to the convertible bond holders. So while investors may be impressed with Saylor's conviction and creativity in financing his incremental bitcoin purchases as I am, they might prefer the simplicity of a security that trades like a stock, with valuation that trades more like the underlying asset, bitcoin. The trade For those investors, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) , operated by Blackrock, presents a promising option. With a $50 billion market cap and operated by the world's largest asset manager, the ETF's objective is to reflect the performance of spot bitcoin. If one trades stocks and options in a brokerage account, this security is as accessible as any ETF, and very active and liquid options are also listed on it. Buying IBIT as a proxy for bitcoin in a promising approach for those who want to trade it like a stock in a conventional brokerage account. For those that believe bitcoin will likely find support at the recent lows now that the crypto reserve has been more formally announced, but also acknowledge it could bump into near-term resistance at the prior late January highs, one could buy longer-term calls financed in part by the sale of a nearer-term strangle as follows: Buy Jan. 16 2026 $50 call Sell Apr. 17 2025 $45 put Sell Apr. 17 2025 $60 call DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

I want to embrace the volatility and produce income based upon the higher premiums investors are now paying for downside protection.

Nvidia, the leader in the AI chip space, has been the backbone of the Mag 7's performance over the past couple of years, with its stock surging nearly 1,800% over five years due to the AI boom. The ""repricing"" of the Mag 7 reflects the market reassessing their valuations which in turn is creating opportunity on the high beta stock Nvidia.

How to use market volatility to trade popular AI stocks such as Nvidia and Palantir,"Some of the biggest artificial intelligence plays have sold off dramatically during the recent market turmoil, and here's how to trade them right now according to Quint Tatro, founder and president of Joule Financial. Tatro broke down his views on Nvidia , Snowflake and Palantir on Friday on CNBC's ""Three-Stock Lunch."" Nvidia Nvidia has fallen 12.7% week to date, on pace for its third down week in a row. Tatro believes investors could start selling on any future relief rally as an oversold bounce is due. ""If you are caught in this name and you have watched it decline and you are hoping and praying for a relief rally when it comes, I think you should consider lightening the position here,"" Tatro said.

""This is a little difficult because you're looking at a company that's trading [at] 100 times forward earnings like, why would you ever touch that? But the earnings are accelerating the beat, top and bottom,"" he said. Tatro said Snowflake is in a sweet spot, assisting companies storing and working with large amounts of data and helping them to implement AI to improve customer efficiency and profitability.

Palantir For Palantir, Tatro said he continues to be an owner of the stock. Palantir said Friday it is rolling out its first two AI-enabled systems to the U.S. Army.

There will be a better opportunity and Palantir is best-of-breed going forward,"" Tatro said. ""It's going to be a standout stock for a long time but a very tough buy at this level.""

"Buy the dip in these two 'best-in-class' names, strategist Jay Woods says","Recent pullbacks in Amazon and Goldman Sachs may provide a golden opportunity for investors, according to Jay Woods of Freedom Capital Markets. The firm's chief global strategist appeared on CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Thursday, offering his takes on some of the day's biggest market stories. Here is what he had to say during ""Three-Stock Lunch."" Amazon Shares of the dominant e-commerce platform fell almost 4% Thursday, leaving it off 5.5% for the week and on pace for its fifth straight weekly loss on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff developments . ""We're afraid of tariffs. We know that concern, but overall, you look at what they've done consistently over time, it's best in class,"" Woods said. AMZN YTD mountain AMZN, year-to-date While the stock has fallen nearly 9% year to date, it has still risen almost 16% over the past 12 months. Woods also highlighted Amazon shares holding above their 200-day moving average, now around $200, according to FactSet. ""I want to put money to work here,"" he continued. ""I want to get in the stock. If you've not been in Amazon, you have a time to get into it right now, because $200 is a great level. And then, if this market accelerates, I think anything cheaper [is a] great opportunity."" Goldman Sachs Like Amazon, Woods views Goldman Sachs – which also fell more than 4% Thursday – as another best-in-class stock giving new investors an opportunity to buy. ""Mergers and acquisitions are going to happen,"" he said. ""Now, we're living through tariff season, which I didn't know was a season until just recently, and we are focused on that, and M & A has been pushed to the side.""

""I know the price at the pump has been going down and the sector has been beaten down, but if you can stay long the stock above $102, $103, you can manage that risk,"" the strategist said.

"Here’s why Uber could rally 31% in the next year, Girard CIO says","Shares of Uber have already surged 27% to start off the year, but Girard Advisory Services' Timothy Chubb believes there's more upside ahead for the ride-sharing stock. The firm's chief investment officer joined CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" on Wednesday to share his take on the name, along with a pair of other market movers. Here's what he had to say. Uber Despite its year-to-date outperformance, it has been a choppy time for Uber stock. Last month, shares lost nearly 8% in a single day after the company guided for softer-than-expected gross bookings in its first quarter. Uber also missed on analysts' earnings expectations, although it posted a fourth-quarter revenue beat. Still, Chubb highlighted Uber as one of his highest conviction ideas. ""I think Uber is a perfect example where the fundamentals of the core business are doing extremely well,"" he said. ""I think the market is still really underappreciating just how much more activity they're having with their users on the platform as compared to a Lyft, for example, and how much free cash flow they're generating."" On Tuesday, Uber began offering robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, through a partnership with Waymo. The companies are planning to launch in several other U.S. cities this year. Chubb added that shares of Uber could ""certainly"" trade above $100 at some point within the next year or so. If the stock crosses this threshold, that would mark a 31% gain from Uber's Wednesday close. CrowdStrike On the other hand, Chubb highlighted cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike as a pass. The stock tumbled 6.3% on Wednesday after issuing a disappointing earnings forecast . The company said it expects its full-year earnings, excluding some items, to come in between $3.33 and $3.45 per share. This fell short of the $4.42 analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected. CrowdStrike's first-quarter earnings are expected to range between 64 cents and 66 cents per share, below the average estimate of 95 cents. Last July, a CrowdStrike update led to a major IT outage , impairing businesses including airlines and banks. Shares of CrowdStrike have recovered more than 80% since hitting a 52-week low of $200.81 last August, and are up nearly 7% so far this year. ""It's a wonderful business with a lot of stability with that subscription model, but really, one doesn't have that attractive of a valuation,"" Chubb said. Instead, the investor prefers CrowdStrike competitor Fortinet . ""They're a more well-rounded platform and not just end-point detection, and ultimately will benefit, I think, from potentially seeing enterprises shift spending here as [they] potentially streamline things a little bit further,"" he added. Citigroup Finally, Chubb was resoundingly bearish on Citigroup . The stock ended Wednesday slightly higher, but it is nearly 9% lower on the week. Alongside other bank stocks, Citigroup has been dragged lower by tariff uncertainty and fears of an economic slowdown. Chubb said expected deregulation under the Trump administration could provide a ""pretty strong tailwind"" for banks. However, Citigroup still has ""a lot of issues"" to deal with to improve its business efficiency, he said. ""Overall, we're much more attracted to some other areas within the financials, especially those who are going to be a bit more exposed to M & A activity as valuations continue to fall,"" the investor said.",2025-03-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/heres-why-uber-could-rally-31percent-in-the-next-year-girard-cio-says.html,cnbc
"Why investors should stay away from Tesla and Moderna, according to one financial advisor","The tough run in Tesla and Moderna shares so far this year isn't ending anytime soon, according to Courtney Garcia, senior wealth advisor at Payne Capital Management Garcia appeared on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Thursday to give her hot takes on some of the market's biggest movers. Here is what she said during ""Three-Stock Lunch."" Tesla Garcia said she would stay on the sidelines with Tesla, citing the electric vehicle maker's sky-high valuation and a stiffer auto market. According to the financial advisor, the assumption that Tesla will benefit from CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with President Donald Trump and from its lower-priced EV expected later this year is not enough to bolster a bull case for the stock. Autos remain Tesla's core business and the industry is slowing, and also facing price cuts in regions like China with competitive EV markets, she said. ""My biggest problem with Tesla is just the valuation. It trades[at] over 105 times earnings, which is not only expensive to the overall market, but that's even more expensive than its own historical average,"" Garcia continued. ""Whether I find another place to add my money or I wait for a better entry point, I would not jump in with two feet in Tesla right now."" Tesla shares are down 42% from their all-time high in December, hurt by a slowdown in sales. The stock is down about 30% so far in 2025, erasing its election-related euphoria. Moderna Vaccine maker Moderna is another sell for Garcia as the stock continues to garner pushback. The advisor noted Moderna's main source of revenue is from its Covid vaccine, and that bets on the company's mRNA pipeline have not yet been profitable. ""I think there could be some long-term opportunity with other uses of mRNA, but in the meantime, again, I'd stay on the sidelines here,"" she told CNBC. ""It's way too concentrated in Covid vaccines, which I don't think there's a huge opportunity [for] in the short term."" Moderna shares slid 7.5 Thursday after reports that federal health officials under the Trump administration are re-evaluating the company's $590 million contract to help develop a bird-flu vaccine, which was awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services in January during the Biden administration. The stock is down 25% this year as sales of its vaccine have fallen amid a drop in Covid-related demand. Shares have slumped 68% over the past year. Ebay Garcia thinks e-commerce platform Ebay is a stock to buy, even after the company's quarterly report disappointed Wall Street. Shares of Ebay tumbed 8.2% on Thursday after the company forecast first-quarter revenue below analyst estimates, citing consumers scaling back discretionary spending. The stock is up 2.5% year to date, and has soared 43% over the past 12 months. Despite the latest downbeat sentiment, Garcia is bullish on Ebay's future growth opportunities. ""This is a company that has, I think, really been showing that they're willing to innovate,"" Garcia said, making the stock worth buying in the short term. Garcia mentioned Ebay's recent partnerships with Facebook Marketplace and OpenAI and its success with collectibles and luxury goods as growth catalysts that will have a more lasting impact than one quarter's disappointing forward guidance, which she partly blamed on fee changes for eBay's UK sellers.",2025-02-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/investors-should-avoid-tesla-and-moderna-one-financial-advisor-says.html,cnbc

Maley is also optimistic on the company's effort to lift international sales. Workday gets 75% of its sales domestically, and is seeking to broaden that inside the U.S. to include more small- and mid-size companies, as well as internationally, he noted. ""If they can grow that kind of earnings growth from overseas, that's gonna be very bullish, especially because the stock is kind of fairly right in the middle of its five-year range in terms of price to earnings ratio,"" Maley said.

How much consumers are prepared to pay ""for this kind of grocery and food delivery is a concern for me,"" Maley said. ""I love the concept, but they're talking about making it more affordable. Are they going to be able to do that and still maintain their margins? So this is one I want to avoid and not buy on a dip."" Shares slid more than 12% Wednesday after Instacart posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and gave downbeat guidance for the current quarter. The stock is still roughly 36% higher over the past year, but faces stiff competition ahead. Investors are also weighing the effect of Amazon's new artificial intelligence-powered Alexa Plus model, which would be able to complete tasks such as placing grocery orders with Instacart. Lowe's Maley is a fan of home improvement retailer Lowe's, but only as a long-term holding. ""Housing stocks have been getting beaten up completely,"" Maley said, noting recent weak housing starts data and Wednesday's worse-than-expected new home sales. That data ""does make me concerned, but longer-term, I do like the stock and I think that you may not necessarily want to chase it on this bounce, but it's okay to buy over time,"" he said. A couple of positive trends still support the stock, Maley said, including the rebuilding of Los Angeles after its wildfires and continued interest among homeowners looking to improve their existing dwellings rather than taking on a higher-rate mortgage to trade up or downsize.

Here's what he had to say. Alibaba Shares of Alibaba ended Friday almost 6% higher and reached a fresh 52-week high following a report in The Wall Street Journal that GameStop CEO and billionaire investor Ryan Cohen upped his personal stake in the company to about $1 billion. The stock gained 15% on the week and is ahead 45% in February alone. Despite the rally, Nations sees room ahead for Alibaba. Capital spending will increase in coming years, but those assets will ultimately boost its artificial intelligence business.

Block will roll out Afterpay on its Cash App debit card this week. ""The company is going to essentially change itself into essentially a lender,"" Nations noted, adding that's ""a better business to be in than the point-of-sale, point-of-purchase systems."" However, given Block's ""not particularly good"" first-quarter guidance, Nations cautioned that he views the stock as a buy at the level around where it is currently trading, $68, with a stop loss at $60. ""Trade with a stop because if the company can't pull out of this nosedive, then you don't want to be along for that ride either,"" he added. UnitedHealth Group Finally, Nations was resoundingly bearish on UnitedHealth Group . The stock sank 7% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the insurer's Medicare billing practices , citing people familiar with the matter. The investigation is centered around examining UnitedHealth's protocols for recording diagnoses that could lead to extra payments for the company's Medicare Advantage plans. Nations said this was just the latest in a series of challenges for UNH. ""This is a relatively slow-growth, low-beta name,"" the investor said. ""It now has a bunch of legal and PR problems, and this isn't its only legal problem. There also some antitrust problems. A quick resolution of the news about Medicare might be impressive but it doesn't mean that it's going to be smooth sailing, and investors just don't have to be along for this ride. So it's a sell,"" Nations added.",2025-02-21 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/why-alibaba-is-the-ultimate-ai-play-according-to-investor-scott-nations.html,cnbc

All-Weather stock list update: Some odd duck equities that have no correlation to the economy,"We're adding three more stocks to our All-Weather Stock List . These three are odd companies that dominate niche industries, allowing their revenues to steadily grow with no correlation to the overall economy. CNBC Pro created the All-Weather list back in late February after seeing some worrying signs in the market. We'll be adding stocks to the list over time with a goal of finding durable companies that allow investors to win in any type of economy. We'll be creating more lists this year. CNBC Pro is building them using analysis, screening techniques and research used by the pros. You can view updates on our stock lists here . New addition: A play on legal fees Our first addition is Burford Capital (BUR) , a company which practices litigation finance. Companies and law firms use Burford to ""pay fees and expenses, accelerate expected claims, judgments and awards,"" according to the company's website. It was brought to our attention by Deutsche Bank financial industry analyst Mark DeVries, who last week named it one of three stocks to buy for an uncertain macroeconomic environment. ""Given Burford's business of financing commercial litigation, which occurs throughout the business cycle, their core demand drivers are inherently uncorrelated to the performance of broader markets,"" wrote DeVries. BUR YTD mountain Burford Capital, YTD Plus, the analyst believes the stock will do more than just weather any economic downturn. He said there's still a backlog of legal cases delayed from the pandemic that should ""provide a revenue tailwind through at least 2025."" He has an $18 price target on the stock. One note of caution from DeVries. The share price could be hurt if an appeal by Argentina in a case versus investors represented by Burford is successful. The case involves the nationalization of energy company YPF SA. Next addition: Death services Just like our addition of Waste Management was based on trash hauling being recession resistant, we have another new member from an industry Wall Street has long believed to have the ultimate durability: death. Service Corporation International (SCI) is North America's biggest provider of death care products and services. It operated more than 1,400 funeral homes and nearly 500 cemeteries as of the end of 2023. The stock has remarkably consistent returns. Over the last 15 years, it has only three down years and its worst performance of those three was a 2.6% decline during 2022. Considering that it pays a 1.6% dividend, then investors pretty much never lost money in 15 years in this name. Its bottom line is consistent with net income at the company growing at a 7% annual rate the past five years, according to FactSet. SCI 5Y mountain Service Corp. International, 5 years Because of the nature of its business, there aren't may analysts who cover the stock. But Wall Street is generally bullish and believes Service Corp. will see revenue accelerate as the baby boomer population ages. Analysts, on average, see 11% upside for the stock the next 12 months. Next addition: Market data As market turmoil continues and the slowing economy forces companies to restructure debt, demand for our next company's services will likely increase. That next addition is S & P Global (SPGI) , a financial data, analytics and ratings company. Goldman Sachs just highlighted S & P Global to clients as part of its hunt for defensive growth stocks trading at cheap prices. The investment bank looked for companies that have consistent sales growth, low share price volatility and cheap multiples based on their history, and S & P Global fit the bill. ""Reflecting benefits of diversification, SPGI's non-Ratings businesses are collectively tracking to grow high-single-digits this year, driven by secular tailwinds, market share gains and wallet penetration,"" Goldman said in a recent report. ""The company expects billed debt issuance volumes and Ratings revenue to sustain positive growth in 2025 driven by ongoing debt refinancing needs and improving M & A volumes."" The stock had only two down years in the past 15 and pays a small dividend to boot. UBS recently called it one of the best large, quality stocks in the U.S. market.

All weather stocks: Two more names to ride out this rough market,"There are two more stocks to consider for riding out the stock market storm of 2025. One sits atop a mountain of trash and the other atop a pile of cash. These are part of our new stock lists at CNBC Pro, which we launched with the All Weather Stock List near the end of last month. As stated on Feb. 26, we started the All Weather list because of some troubling signs in the markets and economy, including the too-low Cboe Volatility Index level and Walmart's poor forecast. This was cause enough for a look at stocks and funds that are durable and can provide income. We are creating the lists using stock analysis methods, screening techniques and Wall Street research used by the pros. (You can view updates on our stock lists here .) Update on All Weather list First, a quick update on how the first member of the All Weather list is doing: The VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF (DURA) . So far, the exchange-traded fund is living up to its name with a return of about 1% versus an S & P 500 decline of about 6% since we wrote about it in Feb. 26. DURA 1M mountain VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF, 1 month Its top holdings include defensive shares such as Johnson & Johnson and Altria , which are enjoying strong months as investors dump their ""Magnificent 7"" holdings for shares with steady cash flows. New addition: Waste Management Our next addition to the list is Waste Management (WM) , the trash and recycling giant that scored highly in our screen of low-beta and low-volatility stocks that are weathering the market so far this year. Waste Management has a beta of 0.5, meaning it is one of the steadier names in the S & P 500 as the benchmark fluctuates. The shares are basically flat for the last month during this market turmoil. It also sports a small dividend. WM YTD mountain Waste Management, YTD Trash, along with some other industries like funeral services and tobacco, have typically been looked at on Wall Street as recession havens because they are services that are always needed. That's actually backed up by some strong results during the toughest economic periods. ""The industry has defensive qualities with recurring and predictable revenue streams,"" wrote Deutsche Bank in a favorable note on the waste industry last year. ""Peak-to-trough MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) generation declined under 5% during the Great Recession,"" stated the Deutsche Bank note, which pointed out the waste stocks outperformed the S & P 500 by a large margin from 2007 to 2009. We are likely not headed into another one of those kinds of dire periods, but there are signs that the consumer and companies are pulling back. Delta Air Lines' lowered forecast this week was the latest signal . Next addition: Berkshire Hathaway Our next addition to the list is the iconic Berkshire Hathaway . Have you noticed which stock is flat this week while the market is reeling? It's Warren Buffett's conglomerate. I don't think there's ever been a U.S. company that's more of a fortress than Berkshire is right now. It has a $334 billion cash pile that's bigger than the market value of all, but about 23 companies in the S & P 500. Berkshire gets nearly a third of its revenue from the defensive insurance business, according to FactSet data. Buffett has trimmed down the stock portfolio for the last 9 quarters, making it no longer as beholden to the moves in, say, Apple shares. ""We continue to believe BRK's shares are an attractive stock in an uncertain macro environment, while insurance fundamentals remain strong and with good margin visibility,"" said UBS after Berkshires' earnings last month. UBS has a buy rating and $557 price target for the stock. BRK.B YTD mountain Berkshire Hathaway, B-shares I don't believe Buffett has been selling stock and amassing cash steadily as some sort of expectation of an imminent stock market crash. I think it's more about market valuation that's been steadily creeping into the stratosphere over the last two years. I think when valuations get out of control, he starts to take a more defensive posture. And since Buffett apparently hasn't been able to find anything at a reasonable price for years, a sizable cash mountain has resulted. Buffett sort of gave a nod to the lack of values out there in his annual letter last month: ""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities."" I think the 94-year-old legend is also building this fortress to give his successor, Greg Abel, the strongest footing when he eventually takes over. And that's the reason to be optimistic about Berkshire beyond whatever economic or market setback may come. If a slowdown or recession hits and market valuations come down, Buffett and/or Abel will not hesitate to finally deploy that capital at bargain prices. And like during the Great Financial Crisis, Buffett will be among the few firms in a position to do so. Buffett in the annual letter reiterated his commitment to equities and I believe him. He's just waiting for the right chance, which may come after this latest washout is over. The list So here's where are All Weather Stock List stands now: This is not a portfolio, but a starting point for research by investors with a particular macro or industry view. We'll be adding to this list and creating others as the year goes on.",2025-03-11 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/all-weather-stocks-two-more-names-to-ride-out-this-rough-market.html,cnbc
An all weather investment that's consistently positive for those tired of the market roller coaster,"The first member of the CNBC Pro All Weather Stock list is a surprisingly resilient exchange-trade fund that offers high dividend income to boot. The timing is right for this list in particular because of the precarious set-up of the stock market so far in 2025. We'll be adding to it periodically as the year goes on. Consider: It's extremely rare for the S & P 500 to notch a third year in a row of 20% gains. We are due for a period of mild-to-down returns for equities where other kinds of investments besides momentum stocks perform. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is not matching the reality of the market's outlook. Fiscal and monetary policies here and abroad that will impact the macroeconomic environment are near high levels of uncertainty. Yet Wall Street's fear gauge (before the last few days) was mostly trending lower again in 2025. We are due for a volatility spike that typically hits Wall Street every few years. Signs of slowing economic growth are starting to emerge, from Walmart's poor forecast last week to the recent declines in consumer sentiment surveys. Dividend investing has been completely forgotten over this bull run and is due for a snapback. Here's how we found the first member of our All Weather List. We screened thousands of exchange-traded funds to find ones with extraordinary stability. Just 10 funds have posted positive returns in each of the last five years, as well as so far this year. From there just one fund had a dividend yield above 3% and an expense ratio below 0.3%. (The data we used was from FactSet.) New list member: VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF (DURA) The ETF is the VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF (DURA) , which tracks the performance of the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Valuation Index. Here are the key reasons why we added the fund: The fund had solid returns the last five years in bull and bear market environments. It returned 2.4% in 2022 when the S & P 500 tumbled 19%. Last year, it returned 9% as the market soared. The ETF has a 12-month yield of 3.27%, allowing you to get paid to wait if the market goes through a correction or volatile period. Top holdings include AbbVie , Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer and Altria , all stocks that have dependable cash flows and are relatively immune to a lot of the changes going on in Washington. The ETF has never had a down year in its six years of existence. The fund will still appreciate in a bull market and throw off stable income. The ETF is up 4% already this year in price return alone, beating the market. The index it tracks tries to find high-yielding companies with strong financials that are cheap. DURA YTD mountain VanEck Durable High Dividend ETF (DURA), YTD The risks to this investment, which charges 0.29% in fees, are: The bull market led by momentum stocks continues unabated despite recent threats to the economy, leaving dividend and value investing in the dustbin. What this fund gives up for stable returns punishes it over the long term. It's returned only 7% annually the last five years. So, this bet will likely only be successful if the market underperforms its recent history. The fund's two biggest holdings are Chevron and Exxon Mobil . If there is a recession, these stocks could fall with the price of oil and wipe out any benefit from their dividend yields. If a vicious bear market ensues instead of a run-of-the-mill correction, it could drag down most stocks significantly, even defensive ones like those held in this fund. But this ETF should be expected to outperform. This is the first addition to the All Weather List: This is not a portfolio, but a starting point for research by investors with a particular macro or industry view. We'll be launching more PRO stock lists to give investors with a particular view some tangible strategies to consider. The lists will be formed from screening techniques used by the pros, along with our access to some of the best research on Wall Street.",2025-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/an-all-weather-investment-thats-consistently-positive-for-those-tired-of-the-market-roller-coaster.html,cnbc
A key report on inflation also could provide an important view on how consumers are doing,"A Commerce Department report Friday could tell two important stories: that inflation isn't going away, and that consumers are taking steps to brace for the coming impact of more price increases courtesy of President Donald Trump 's tariffs. Wall Street will give close watch to the double-barreled release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which will show the levels of personal income and spending for February, as well as the latest reading on personal consumption expenditures prices. The latter metric is the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge it uses when deciding where to set interest rates . While the inflation part of the release has been garnering more interest for the past few years, the spending portion could become the more interesting aspect in coming months as the tariff impact weaves through the U.S. economy. Worth watching in the February report is whether households moved to get in under the wire before more widespread duties take effect. Spending is projected to increase a solid 0.5% on the month after declining 0.2% in January , according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. The increase, though, could be more consumers trying to get ahead of the tariffs rather than a secular sign of strength. After all, recent surveys show consumer sentiment at multiyear lows , indicating a looming pullback amid the tariff-induced uncertainty. ""Producers and consumers have pulled forward economic activity to avoid potential tariffs, which has skewed hard data and dampened soft sentiment data,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at tax consultancy RSM. ""With another round of tariffs set to take effect on April 2, American households, flush with income gains, may be pulling forward purchases of durables that will see higher prices in the near term."" Recent data lends some credence to the pull-forward narrative. Bank of America credit card monitoring showed spending last week up 1.5% from a year ago. Moreover, the areas that benefited included some tariff-sensitive sectors such as online electronics, which jumped 7.3%, and online retail, which saw a 3.9% gain. Spending for those sectors came at the expense of gasoline (-9.2%), airlines (-7.2%) and entertainment (-6.8%.) The trend is significant as consumer spending accounted for 68% of all economic activity in the U.S. during 2024, a year during which the economy grew at a 2.8% rate compared to the prior year. Inflation, though, also will be on investors' minds for the Friday release. The data is expected to show little change in the recent pace, with both headline and core rates for the PCE price index rising 0.3% in February and the respective annual rates at 2.5% and 2.7%. If the core forecast is correct, that would represent a 0.1 percentage point gain from January — small, to be sure, but moving in the wrong direction. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said Tuesday that he's leery of taking the view that inflation price hikes will be temporary. ""The indirect, second-round effects on non-imported goods and services could have a more persistent impact on underlying inflation,"" the central bank official said. Markets expect the uncertainty of tariffs and the persistence of inflation will keep the Fed on the sidelines until at least June, with a likelihood of two or three total rate cuts this year.

"Options market is pricing in a disruptive, but not catastrophic, response to April 2","The April 2 tariff deadline could be a disruptive, but not catastrophic, event for stocks, according to the options market. The S & P 500 may end next week up or down 2.5%, according to options expiring Friday, April 4, according to Michael Khouw, chief strategist at OpenInterest.Pro. A typical move for the broad market index is a move of less than 2% to end the week — possibly 1.9%, or less. But while a move of 2.5% or more in either direction would be above average, it certainly wouldn't count as wild compared with history, Khouw said. That suggests traders expect the final decision on reciprocal tariffs will be far less stringent than the Trump administration initially indicated. ""The way I read the options market, most people's expectation is it's going to be disruptive — mildly so — but probably over the course of time, there will be some kind of a normalization where we reach a compromise, and it's not going to be that severe,"" said Khouw. ""That's what's currently priced in."" Other Wall Street strategists are concerned that investors underestimate the potential for April 2 to serve as a market negative. Wolfe Research's Tobin Marcus expects the final level of reciprocal tariffs will be high next week, and ""likely more severe than markets expect."" This week, Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius said the event might act as a starting point for negotiations and ""incentivizes the administration to propose higher rates at the outset."" Still, the recent concerns around April 2 may have eased somewhat as President Donald Trump walked back some of his tough stance on trade. On Tuesday, he told Newsmax that tariffs will likely be ""more lenient than reciprocal."" Another signal of potential softening came later from a White House official, who told CNBC's Eamon Javers that the Trump administration will no longer take into account nontariff barriers raised against the United States by other countries to determine the reciprocal tariff rate. ""It looks more like a disruption than it looks like a catastrophe,"" Khouw said. On the other hand, Trump late Wednesday said he would place 25% tariffs on ""all cars that are not made in the United States."" So, if nothing else, trade conditions remain fluid.

Concern about a major market decline is growing,"Between tariffs, sticky inflation and uncertainty around the future of U.S. monetary and fiscal policy, people are getting more and more worried about what is next for the stock market. An online survey conducted by Allianz Life Insurance found that 51% of respondents ""worry that another big market crash is on the horizon."" That is up from 46% at the end of the fourth quarter. The company surveyed 1,004 people ages 18 and older. The survey also found that only 26% of respondents are comfortable with current market conditions, down from 31% at the end of 2024. Indeed, the market action in 2025 has been a departure from what investors experienced the past two years. The S & P 500 is down nearly 3% year to date and briefly dipped into correction earlier this month, trading 10% below a record set in February. In contrast, the benchmark rallied more than 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. The latest downdraft comes as President Donald Trump moves forward with a slew of tariffs on imported goods. Late Wednesday, he announced a 25% levy on ""all cars that are not made in the United States,"" set to take effect next week. He has also unveiled duties targeting products from key trading partners such as China, Canada and Mexico. There are other indications of souring sentiment on the market and the economy. The Conference Board's confidence report for March showed consumers turned negative on the stock market for the first time since the end of 2023. Specifically, a little more than just 37% of respondents see stock prices rising over the next year. On top of that, a Deutsche Bank survey showed that roughly 43% of respondents expect a recession in the next 12 months. The choppy market moves are unlikely to abate. Stocks sold off again on Wednesday ahead of the latest tariff unveiling. ""While part of this de-risking could be driven by a slew of negative news in AI/Tech, including NVDA's China environmental curbs, sell-side report on MSFT lease cancellation, BABA's comments on AI bubbles, the broad anxiety around tariffs also drove more appetite on de-risking ahead of April 2,"" wrote traders at JPMorgan. ""Does this mean the end of a tradable bounce?

The analyst note that helped fuel the tech sell-off Wednesday,"TD Cowen's note outlining Microsoft' s abandonment of two data center projects added fuel to the sell-off in Big Tech shares Wednesday. According to analyst Michael Elias, Microsoft walked away from the two data centers — which were expected to have more than 2 gigawatts of capacity — in the U.S. and Europe over the past six months. The Windows and Xbox company has also delayed or canceled data center leases over the past month, he added. Microsoft traded 1.3% lower Wednesday, snapping a three-day rebound, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped more than 2%. Artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 6%, bringing its one-month decline to more than 13%. Vertiv Holdings, a provider of infrastructure and services for data centers, slid 11% on Wednesday, its worst day since July. ""In our view, the pullback on new capacity leasing by Microsoft was largely driven by the decision to not support incremental Open AI training workloads,"" Elias wrote in a research note published Wednesday. ""However, we continue to believe the lease cancellations and deferrals of capacity points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast."" According to Elias, Google parent Alphabet is stepping in to take over some of the backfill capacity Microsoft's canceled leases have left globally, while Meta Platforms is assuming the void in the U.S. market. ""Both of these hyperscalers are in the midst of a material Y/Y ramp in data center demand,"" Elias said. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange! Uncertain markets?

"Bank of America sees gold rising to $3,500 on central bank, China buying","Gold could hit $3,500 per ounce within the next two years with central banks and China's insurance industry driving demand, according to Bank of America. Gold has gained 14% this year to break $3,000 per ounce for the first time as geopolitical tensions and President Donald Trump's trade war pushes some investors into safe-haven assets. Bank of America now sees gold averaging $3,063 per ounce this year and $3,350 in 2026. ""Uncertainty around Trump Administration trade policies could continue to push the [U.S. dollar] USD lower, further supporting gold prices near-term,"" commodity analysts led by Michael Widmer told clients in a Wednesday note. Prices can go even higher to $3,500 if investment demand grows 10%, according to the bank. China's insurance industry can invest 1% of its assets in gold, which is equivalent to about 6% of the annual gold market, according to the commodity analysts. Central banks, meanwhile, are already holding about 10% of their reserves in gold and could increase this figure to 30% or more, the analysts wrote. Retail investors are also increasing their exposure through physically backed exchange-traded funds, with assets under management rising 4% year over year in the Americas, Europe and Asia, according to the bank.

"Stocks may still be too expensive even after the recent sell-off, Deutsche Bank warns","Stocks have been on the backfoot for weeks, leaving many investors in search of a silver lining. One of those may be that equities are now trading at a discount to the levels they were when the S & P 500 was at an all-time high in February. But Deutsche Bank warns that U.S. stocks may still be expensive. ""We remain close to the most expensive U.S. equity valuations in history seen back in 2000,"" strategist Jim Reid wrote, citing the S & P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE). CAPE compares current prices to earnings over the past 10 years. By that measure, the S & P 500 is trading at more than 35 times earnings. For context, CAPE peaked at about 45 during the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. ""At face value, it looks like a bubble; however, you could argue the tech sector has the potential to see a structural shift in U.S. earnings relative to the long-term trend,"" Reid wrote. Technology was the market leader in 2024, as investors scooped up shares to gain exposure to artificial intelligence beneficiaries. This year, tech is struggling, losing more than 7%. The near-term outlook for the overall market looks grim, unless tech is able to regain its mojo down the road. Barclays lowered its 2025 S & P 500 target to 5,900 — lowest on the Street — from 6,600 as pressure from rising trade tensions dents investor sentiment. The bank's forecast implies little to no upside from where the benchmark began the year. ""Our base case assumes that earnings take a hit as tariffs (higher China tariffs stick but do not escalate, reciprocal tariffs amount to 5% on [the rest of the world]) contribute to material slowing in U.S. activity that nonetheless stops short of outright recession,"" strategist Venu Krishna wrote . ""Given significant uncertainty around trade policy, our bull and bear case EPS estimates hinge upon the final scope and severity of tariffs (60% probability)."" Elsewhere Wednesday morning on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley initiated Tenet Healthcare with an overweight rating and a price target that implies upside of more than 26%. ""A significant business model and balance sheet transformation has yet to be captured in THC's multiple,"" analyst Craig Hettenbach wrote to clients . ""Risks of government spending cuts likely remain an overhang near term, providing entry points for patient investors in what should emerge as a much cleaner story and durable business.""",2025-03-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/stocks-may-be-too-expensive-even-after-sell-off-deutsche-bank-warns.html,cnbc

"Why there's likely more pain ahead for U.S. stocks, according to HSBC","HSBC says high levels of uncertainty surrounding the economy mean U.S. assets will stay under pressure. Questions about the level of tariffs on which products from which countries ahead of the April 2 start date set by President Donald Trump have led to a ""confidence shock"" in households and businesses, the London-based bank said. It noted that consumer sentiment has weakened, price expectations have risen and consumer expectations regarding the labor market have worsened. ""Uncertainty around the 2 April deadline may also be very high. But what matters most to us is the probability of these unusually high levels of uncertainty disappearing entirely beyond 2 April. That probability seems pretty low, in our view,"" Max Kettner, HSBC's chief multi-asset strategist, wrote in a research note Tuesday. ""We, therefore, continue to think U.S. assets will remain challenged in the near term,"" Kettner added. Against rising doubts about the U.S., stocks in Europe have scored their largest-ever quarterly gain compared to the S & P 500 in records going back to 1991.

Tracking this gauge allows you to trade the stock market roller coaster,"Traders' most widely cited measure of fear is currently pointing to cause for confidence, according to Wall Street veteran Nick Colas. The Cboe Volatility Index , an options-based measure of expected market gyrations, has drifted below its long-term average after previously spiking, which Colas said in his overnight market note Monday is often an attractive time to buy stocks. Specifically, he pointed out that the fear gauge closed at 27.9 on March 10, or more than one standard deviation above its long-term average of 19.5. That close, he said, ""proved to be a good entry point to buy the S & P 500 ."" .VIX 3M line VIX movements ""Even though US large caps wobbled for a few days after, the index is now 2.7 percent higher,"" added Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""This is exactly what should happen. Investors and traders who buy unusual levels of uncertainty, expressed as expected stock price volatility (i.e., what the VIX measures), expect to see a near term gain for their troubles."" In more recent moves, the VIX closed at around 17.5 on Monday and edged down even more in Tuesday trading. Should the index hold below 19.5, it will send a message that the recent volatility, induced by President Donald Trump 's tariffs plans and worries about economic growth , has been largely priced into market activity, Colas said. ""It's too early to declare victory over policy-related uncertainty and the stock market volatility it creates, but today was a big step in the right direction,"" he wrote. ""Simply put, the bulls needed not just an outsized rally but also the decline in the VIX to lay the groundwork for further gains."" While the near-term figure he said to watch on the VIX is 27.3, Colas noted that a move past 35.1, or two standard deviations above the norm, would be an even stronger short-term buy signal.

U.S. stocks may be setting up for a comeback against global rivals,"The vibes have been off for U.S. stocks in 2025. The S & P 500 is down about 2% year to date, even after hitting an all-time high last month. In contrast, the rest of the world seems to be doing great. The iShares MSCI All-Country World Index ex-U.S. ETF (ACWX) has popped 8.9% this year. Europe's Stoxx 600 index is up 9.3% so far in 2025 and hit an all-time high earlier in March. This year's underperformance by U.S. stocks comes amid uncertainty around the Trump's administration's trade policy and tariff plans — and how that may affect the economy. This trend, however, could see a reversal in the near term, according to some on Wall Street. .SPX ACWX,.STOXX YTD mountain SPX vs ACWX and STOXX 600 year to date ""While we have seen the rotation out of U.S. into EU YTD … yesterday's price action suggests a pause or reversal in this rotation may be coming soon,"" traders at JPMorgan wrote.

Mag7 valuation now looking 'cheap' vs historic; 2) Europe benefited from exodus from U.S. tech, U.S. tech as a sell is significantly less obvious here; 3) Mkt was too extreme in pricing U.S. exceptional on DJT win, that's already unwound; 4) CTA / technical setup (CTA now long EU vs U.S. top end of historic range); 5) Huge month end / Q End buying to come is +ve US vs EU,"" they added, referring to hedge funds using commodity trading advisor strategies. U.S. stocks are showing signs of fighting back. Over the past week, the S & P 500 is up 2.7%, while the Stoxx 600 is flat. The ACWX has fallen 0.8% over the past week. A look at the charts also points to a bounce for U.S. equities against their international counterparts, according to Wolfe Research. ""It looks like the U.S. is setting up for a little near-term outperformance vs. the rest of the world following a tough 4-month stretch. We flagged the parabolic advance and overbought condition of the U.S. back in mid-November and following a violent unwind, we are now seeing the mirror image develop on a few different fronts,"" wrote strategist Rob Ginsberg. Specifically, he noted that Chinese tech stocks are now overbought relative to the Nasdaq 100 index, while the S & P 500 recently teetered near oversold territory. The benchmark's 14-day relative strength index reading sits around 30, near the level that has preceded sharp rebounds in the index. Elsewhere Tuesday morning on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas upgraded Carvana to overweight from equal weight . ""While Carvana remains more exposed to a lower strata of auto credit relative to the rest of our auto coverage, the company has demonstrated execution with profitable growth and addressed leverage concerns,"" Jonas said in a note.

'Magnificent 7' has a notable up day after struggling for 3 months,"The "" Magnificent Seven "" stocks rallied along with the broader market on Monday, raising hopes for a turnaround after a monthslong rout in the biggest technology names. All seven stocks in the Magnificent Seven rose in the session, with CNBC's index of the group adding about 3.7%. Tesla led the way, soaring more than 11%, the most since November. Meta followed, climbing nearly 4%. That marks an about face after the megacap tech stocks underperformed in recent months. The Magnificent Seven lagged the broad market S & P 500 in 11 of the past 12 weeks, according to data analyzed by Raymond James. ""I can think of no better simple measure to determining hedge fund de-leveraging and global equity flight from the U.S.,"" Tavis McCourt, institutional equity strategist at Raymond James, wrote to clients in a Sunday note. ""There has been no panic, just very consistent underperformance for essentially a quarter,"" he added. ""One gets the sense the global rotation out of U.S. equities has not stabilized until this trend reverses."" .MAG7 .SPX 3M mountain CNBC's Magnificent 7 index vs. the S & P 500, 3 months In McCourt's view, Monday's Magnificent Seven performance can be a reason for optimism in the broader market. But Wall Street is divided on what to expect out of this closely followed group in coming months. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson said earnings revisions for Magnificent Seven companies appear to be bottoming. That can encourage investors to rotate back into U.S. stocks, he said, given that a key overhang has been underperformance by the high-tech leadership. On the other hand, Mislav Matejka, head of global and European equity strategy at JPMorgan, dissents. He said the Magnificent Seven's recent ""respite"" from oversold territory will likely not last and that investors should look instead to defensive names. ""Growth style, U.S. Tech & Mag-7 are unlikely to sustainably rebound this year, in our view, due to still elevated positioning, concentration risk and high expectations,"" Matejka wrote to clients in a Monday note.

How we'll know this comeback is more than just an oversold bounce,"Here's how we'll know if this comeback rally is more than just an oversold bounce, according to technicians. Stocks surged Monday to kick off the trading week, with the major averages all up more than 1%, following reports that President Donald Trump could take a softer stance on tariffs . This comes after the S & P 500 on Friday snapped a four-week losing streak , posting a 0.5% weekly advance. But technicians are watching key levels to see if the rally is sustainable, or if it represents just a temporary bit of relief after the pullback over the last month, during which the S & P 500 dipped into correction territory . .SPX 1M mountain S & P 500 ""If this bounce is more than a simple oversold move, we should expect the S & P 500 to retain 5,825,"" JC O'Hara, chief market technician at Roth Capital Partners, wrote Sunday. ""The first move which should be celebrated by the bulls is a successful close above 5,700 as that is the level where sellers have become very aggressive. The ability to break above that line will be a partial indication of seller's exhaustion."" A move to 5,825 would be a 2.8% advance above where the S & P 500 closed Friday, at 5,667.56. A close above 5,700 would be a less than 1% gain. On Monday, the S & P 500 was at 5,762 at noon. Similarly, Oppenheimer's Ari Wald said he's waiting for the S & P 500 to reclaim resistance at 5,750, which also represents the 200-day moving average for the benchmark. He noted 5,500 is a critical support level for the broader index, while resistance is more ""formidable"" at 5,900, which also represents the 50-day moving average. In fact, he noted that risk leadership, in particular, is oversold, meaning this is an area where investors can add exposure. ""In regards to attractive tactical conditions for risk, the High-Beta vs. Low-Volatility ratio is trading 10% below its 200-day average,"" Wald said. ""While we believe longer-term leadership trends are reversing toward low-volatility defensives, this oversold deviation indicates current conditions are unfavorable for risk-off, and conversely, favorable for risk-on."" Other technicians expressed more skepticism stocks could meaningfully break out from here. BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky said he anticipates a ""tactical bounce, but medium-term trouble"" for stocks. Elsewhere, Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said it's critical for the current stock rally to show it has some legs. ""This past week was disappointing, as the S & P was unable to punch above 5700, try as it might,"" Ginsberg wrote over the weekend. ""If upside momentum fails to gain traction in the coming week, this powerful rally so many are banking on, may be a lost cause."" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

Why Goldman Sachs believes stocks could be due for a contrarian bounce the next three months,"Goldman Sachs believes the stock market is poised for a rebound over the next three months as its proprietary sentiment indicator is flashing a contrarian buy signal. The Wall Street firm's U.S. equity sentiment indicator, or SI, which tracks institutional, foreign and retail investor positioning, has declined to a reading of -0.6, the sharpest move in a six-month period since 2020. ""Sharp drops in our SI have historically preceded above-average gains in the S & P 500 during the subsequent 3 months,"" wrote strategists led by David Kostin.

The stocks that are working as the market struggles over the past month,"A handful of sectors have emerged as standout winners in the market turmoil of the past month: utilities, health care, real estate and financials. It hasn't been an easy month for stocks, with President Donald Trump's ramping trade war and economic releases ringing alarm bells of a potential recession at the forefront of investors' minds. Indeed, the S & P 500 is down more than 5% over the past month. These stocks within the broad market index are holding up against the market tumult of the past month, and they're up the most in that period. Most stocks — and sectors — that outperformed this month had a defensive tilt. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, pointed out that these more defensive sectors have fared well for much of the year so far. Notable groups that made CNBC's list include utilities, health care and insurance. Within these categories, dividend payers also put on a standout performance in the period: Utility AES is up 23% over the past month and has a dividend yield of 5.4%. Insurer Allstate offers a dividend yield of 1.9%, and shares are up 11% during the period. Indeed, income from dividends can help buffer portfolios from market volatility. ""It just makes sense that in this risk-off environment that investors are feeling uncertain about, that you're going to see a tendency to seek out more defensive names and defensive sectors,"" Hogan told CNBC in an interview. ""And that's been a clear pattern — not just for this month — but on a year-to-date basis,"" he added. ""It's a big change from how we exited the year, and certainly a big change from the last couple of years, where everything seemed to be about technology and communication services."" Going forward, Hogan thinks it is unlikely that investors will rotate back toward riskier assets until they receive more clarity around the end game of Trump's tariff policy. ""If some of that clears, then those sectors that are the worst performing, they will be able to see a significant rebound,"" he said. Hogan added that more than likely, this defensive positioning will persist until at least into the second quarter. A potential play on rates Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, thinks this defensive tilt has more to do with the interest rate backdrop. He pointed out that the utilities and real estate sectors are two that are particularly sensitive to interest rates due to their dividend yields. ""The 10-year Treasury yield has come down pretty markedly year to date, so it's provided a bit of juice to the yield-sensitive names,"" he said to CNBC. When the yields on risk-free Treasurys come down, dividend stocks become more attractive to income investors. Additionally, Mayfield believes the sectors poised to grow earnings have also been given an advantage. For instance, first-quarter expectations indicated that the utilities and health-care sectors were two that were expected to have strong earnings growth. ""It's a challenging macro environment. There's going to be a bigger dispersion between winners and losers, and that's increasingly going to be about who's able to grow earnings in this sort of environment,"" he added. ""With valuations stretched in most sectors — even the defensive ones — you kind of come back to what does the earnings backdrop for 2025 look like?"" Mayfield said. ""By and large health care, utilities and tech are expected to be leaders there, so that's kind of where I would be looking toward.""",2025-03-21 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/stocks-that-are-working-as-the-market-struggles-over-the-past-month.html,cnbc
How Trump policies weigh on higher education — and why these tax-free bonds could suffer,"The outlook is getting darker for one part of the municipal bond market. The higher education sector was recently downgraded by Moody's Ratings to negative from stable amid potential policy changes from President Donald Trump 's administration. Higher ed and K-12 education are the only two muni sectors Moody's rates negative. The catalyst for the outlook change was a shift in public and private colleges' operating environment, primarily related to growing uncertainty, explained Susan Fitzgerald, managing director of public finance at Moody's Ratings. ""The sector already had a fair number of stresses that it was addressing — particularly on the enrollment side, but also inflation and labor,"" she added. ""You add onto that a shifting federal policy environment, a lot of which is uncertain at this point, and that just makes it much more difficult for these institutions to operate."" Municipal bonds, in general, are favored by the wealthy because they are free of federal taxes. They may also be exempt from state tax if the holder resides in the state in which the bond was issued. Still, investors will need to distinguish between sectors of the muni bond market, as well as specific issuers. Within higher ed, that means taking an institution by institution look to determine how well positioned they are in this evolving environment. Policy impacts on higher ed There are several areas of impact from potential policies coming from the White House, according to Moody's. For one, a 15% cap for National Institutes of Health funding of indirect costs for research will negatively affect operating results of many colleges and universities, Fitzgerald said. ""They would either have to absorb that in their budget … or they would have to significantly scale back on their research if they weren't able to fund it themselves, or they would have to find new donors for that research,"" she said. The NIH announced the cap in early February, but a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction earlier this month. If enacted, the reduced funding could result in more than $100 million per year in cuts for some of the largest highest-tier research institutions that spend at least $50 million on research and development and award at least 70 doctorates annually, Moody's calculates. In addition, there is the possibility that federal financial aid programs, which are run by the Department of Education, could be disrupted as the department is cut back and potentially shut down, Fitzgerald said. That raises a possible credit risk, she said. Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at dismantling the department , although only Congress can eliminate it. The move came after the Education Department laid off nearly half of its employees . The White House said it expects to continue running federal student loans out of the reduced agency. Lawsuits have been filed to stop the closure. Moody's also noted that a possible increase in the excise tax on university endowments would hit more wealthy institutions' budgets. Currently, only about 50 to 60 institutions pay the 1.4% tax on net investment income, which is for private colleges and universities with at least 500 students and wealth of over $500,000 per full-time student, the firm said. If increased to a tax rate above 10% or the base was broadened, it would ""place a far greater strain on financial reserve growth for many more private universities,"" Moody's team said in a note last week. Higher ed institutions also face challenges to operations and enrollment due to possible immigration cuts and enforcement actions against diversity, equity and inclusion programs , Moody's said. Winners and losers Any impact won't necessarily be felt across the board. While wealthier institutions may be in the crosshairs of some of the policies, they are well positioned to come up with solutions, Fitzgerald said. The ones most at risk are smaller private colleges and regional public universities, who are reliant on students who use federal financial aid programs, she said. Those institutions ""have potentially limited wealth and reserves so that they can't really absorb any volatility in their operations,"" she added. Bank of America agrees that top-rated institutions with significant financial resources and strong demand should weather the storm. ""The bifurcation of credit quality continues as the 'Haves' maintain the liquidity and resources to handle the challenges ahead while the 'Have nots' may find the potential drying up of federal funding and additional actions more taxing on operating margins,"" strategist Yingchen Li wrote in a note Friday. Dan Close, head of municipals at Nuveen, has also noted the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" in higher ed, which began before the latest policy announcements. Challenges with enrollment and expenses, as well the drying up of Covid funding has hit the sector, he said. ""If you're a smaller institution that just doesn't have that endowment, doesn't have the resources, this is just going to put that much more pressure on you,"" he said. ""The student aid — those loans and the Pell grants — have been able to drive tuition higher, and not having those, or at least having those maybe in a more limited capacity, is really what could affect top line. Close believes public schools will be OK because state coffers are fairly full, while elite schools will continue to get stronger. For instance, the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond Fund (NHMRX) has a 0.22% holding in American Musical and Dramatic Academy University, based in New York. Its Short Duration High Yield Municipal Bond Fund (NVHIX) has 0.69% of its assets in Ohio State University General Receipt Bonds. Paul Malloy, head of municipals at Vanguard, believes the current headlines are ""just additional noise."" ""This bifurcation has been happening for many years,"" he said, noting that higher ed has been facing rising dilution rates, demographic issues and affordability concerns for some time. Malloy said big universities with strong pipelines to employers or that have a niche program will do just fine despite challenges, while smaller schools with declining enrollment could struggle.

"Cushion your portfolio in rocky times with these buy-rated dividend payers, Goldman says","Shaky tariff policies and tumultuous markets mean investors may have to take a defensive stance and find steady income to shield their portfolios — and Goldman Sachs has a few names that might fit the bill. Even as the three major averages were higher on Monday, the past month hasn't been kind to stocks. The S & P 500 is off nearly 4% in the past month, while the Nasdaq Composite is down by nearly 6%. ""As policy uncertainty (particularly around tariffs) weighs on market sentiment and growth expectations, investors have been increasingly looking to play defense as evidenced by recent outperformance of lower volatility stocks,"" wrote Goldman's Deep Mehta in a report last week. To that end, his team drew up a list of buy-rated names with estimated 2025 dividend yields of at least 2.5% and strong growth in dividends per share and free cash flow/earnings per share – that is, an expected compound annual growth rate of at least 5% in 2024 through 2026. The names also must have an estimated dividend coverage ratio of at least 1x EPS (for financials, real estate and utilities) or free cash flow (for all other sectors) in 2025 and 2026. This metric, also known as dividend cover, is equal to the company's net income divided by the dividend paid. Here are the stocks that turned up in Goldman's search. Zions Bancorporation made the cut. The stock has a current dividend yield of 3.4%, and shares are down nearly 7% in 2025. Wall Street is largely ambivalent on the stock, with 16 out of 22 analysts rating it hold, per LSEG. Still, consensus price targets call for 22% upside from current levels. Fourth-quarter earnings came in at $1.34 per share, topping consensus estimates for $1.26 per share, according to StreetAccount. Net interest income – or the difference between revenue generated by interest and the interest expenses paid out to depositors – of $627 million also surpassed the Street's expectations of $620.8 million. ""ZION increased its [net interest income] outlook to 'moderately' increasing in 2025 vs. 2024,"" wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Peter Winter in a late January report. ""The margin increased throughout 2024 to 3.05% in 4Q vs. 2.91% in 4Q23 and is expected to continue expanding throughout the year driven by fixed asset repricing and lowering deposit costs,"" he added, lifting his price target to $69 per share from $66. Beverage and snacking giant PepsiCo was also on Goldman's list. Last month, the company announced that it would hike its annualized dividend by 5% to $5.69 per share, starting with the June 2025 payment. That marks the company's 53rd consecutive annual dividend increase. Shares are down 4% in 2025, and the stock has a current dividend yield of 3.7%. Goldman Sachs is in good company on its buy rating for Pepsi: Bank of America also deems it a buy. On Monday, the firm dialed back its expectations for Pepsi's first-quarter organic sales ""from slightly positive to slightly negative, but still rounding to flat for the quarter."" That change reflects lowered expectations for Frito organic sales, according to a report from Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane. Analysts largely rate the name a hold, per LSEG, but consensus price targets see more than 11% upside from current levels. Finally, NextEra Energy also emerged on Goldman's list. Shares are down more than 2% in 2025, and the stock has a dividend yield of 3.2%. Last month, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5665 per share, reflecting a roughly 10% increase from the year-ago period. Mizuho's Anthony Crowdell is neutral on NextEra, but notes that renewables offer a ""bridge to gas and nuclear"" – the energy sources data centers will need in order to proliferate. ""NEE's experience operating and developing renewables, gas-fired, and nuclear generation makes them the ultimate 'all forms of energy' company,"" he wrote in a March 19 report. ""While gas plants provide the 24/7 energy that data centers require, NEE noted gas-fired and nuclear generation cannot meet demand in the near-term (2025-30) because both supply chains will need to be rebuilt,"" Crowdell added. Analysts are largely bullish on the name, with 15 out of 23 rating it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Consensus price targets suggest upside of about 20% from current levels. Other names on Goldman's list include Citigroup , SLB and Brixmor Property Group .",2025-03-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/cushion-your-portfolio-in-rocky-times-with-these-buy-rated-dividend-payers-goldman-says.html,cnbc
Wells Fargo spotted three 'bargain banks' worth buying — and they pay sweet dividends,"There are three buying opportunities among beaten-up regional bank names, according to Wells Fargo. The stocks also pay solid dividends. The sector has been facing pressure this year as concerns over the economy weigh on investors. The SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) has lost about 5% in 2025. ""Banks are a proxy for economic uncertainty, but we believe the pendulum swung too far,"" analyst Timur Braziler said in a March 11 note. In particular, the analyst likes ""bargain banks."" KRE YTD mountain SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF In fact, there are three catalysts ahead for regional banks, he said. First, Braziler expects an inflection point in earnings per share. ""We look for EPS growth to turn positive for the first time in 3 years, as largely the entire group benefits from fixed asset repricing and further reduction in funding costs,"" the analyst wrote. ""Timing is still for 2Q25, as the coming quarter deals with typical seasonality on both sides of the balance sheet, but the recent pullback in the group warrants being early."" He also expects valuation improvement alongside EPS growth, with potential upside of at least 30% if the group retains its historical multiple. ""As the EPS inflection plays out and the economic outlook becomes less volatile, regionals stand to benefit the most from new generalist or long-only interest,"" Braziler said. Lastly, he expects mergers and acquisitions to pick up around the same time of the anticipated EPS inflection. ""Higher uncertainty is a negative, yet there are material tailwinds for bank M & A, with the best regulatory inflection in 3 decades and the recent decline in yields helping purchase accounting,"" he said. A trio of bargain basement bank stocks Braziler's top picks include BankUnited , which is down 9% year to date and has a 3.3% dividend yield. The company is now at 89% of tangible book value and has a management team that is pragmatic about a potential partnership, the analyst said. More than half of the analysts covering BankUnited rate it a hold, according to LSEG. However, consensus price targets call for 25% upside from current levels. BKU YTD mountain BankUnited Webster Financial also makes the cut, with Braziler noting that there aren't many banks with a sustainable 17% return on tangible common equity that are trading below eight times EPS. This name will also benefit from more M & A, he added. The stock, which pays a 3.1% dividend yield, is down 6% so far this year. Webster is well-liked on Wall Street, with 13 out of 15 analysts rating it buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Consensus price targets call for nearly 35% upside. WBS YTD mountain Webster Financial Lastly, Banc of California is ""too good a deal to pass up"" with its tangible book value of 85%, Braziler said. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.8% and has lost 8% year to date.

These income-generating stocks are currently beating the market and offer rich yields,"An income-producing asset class made its way into the spotlight this month – and it may be attractive for investors who are willing to take some risk in exchange for hefty dividend yields. Mortgage real estate investment trusts hold mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They lend money to developers and other parties on a range of real estate properties, and they invest in mortgage loans. They're different from equity REITs, which purchase real estate and collect rents from tenants. Earlier this month, mortgage REITs got a shoutout from legendary investor Bill Gross, who posted on social media platform X , ""I own [mortgage] pass-thru REITs like AGNC yielding 13% that will do well at 4.25 on the 10 year but it's hard to believe that yields go lower without visible progress on inflation."" Indeed, AGNC Investment is touting a current dividend yield of 14%, and the stock is up about 12% in 2025 – tempting in a year when the S & P 500 is down more than 3%. But investors should resist the urge to merely rush into the space as they seek outperformance and income at a time when markets are rocky. ""You have to understand what you're buying,"" said Philip Blancato, chief market strategist at wealth management firm Osaic. ""There are scenarios where you can get whipsawed in these things."" Greater risk, richer yields Mortgage REITs have a different risk profile compared to their equity REIT cousins. For starters, they can be highly levered, meaning they use a lot of debt to buy up mortgages. While this leverage can amplify returns, it can also raise their risk profile, Blancato said. Mortgage REITs can be five to seven times levered – that is, five parts debt to one part equity, said Matthew Malone, head of investment management at Opto Investments. Interest rate risk, or duration, bring in another element of risk. Long mortgages offer the prospect of higher yields, but they're also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. This sensitivity to swings in rates is known as duration. Credit quality is also another big consideration. A mortgage REIT can opt to snap up agency mortgages – which tend to be higher quality – or in a bid for higher yields, they can snap up mortgages that are riskier and have higher default risk. Scenarios in which rates are rising can be dangerous for mortgage REITs, Blancato said. ""There are some train wrecks out there – companies that made the wrong interest rate bet, they went too long in duration and had to go down to zero income payments because they had to recoup their principal, reset and then lever up again,"" he said. Those hazards should make investors think twice before they play in the space, particularly if they need that portfolio income. An environment in which interest rates are moving sideways is one that works well for mortgage REITs, Blancato said. Right now, the 10-year Treasury yield is trading at about 4.2%, well off January's high of about 4.8%. Mortgage REITs that are faring well thus far in 2025 include Annaly Capital Management , which is up nearly 19% and offers a dividend yield of nearly 13%, and Dynex Capital , which is up 11% and has a dividend yield of 14.5%. Malone noted that names like Annaly and AGNC are trading at premiums to their net asset value, and that's another consideration for prospective investors. ""If you can buy at a discount to NAV, you might have some appreciation built in,"" he said. ""It's more like: Are you a yield buyer or are you looking for appreciation and getting the yield?"" Who's using them? Mortgage REITs can be dangerous for individual investors to snap up, but institutional investors – including firms that design portfolios for wealth managers – may tap the space as a diversifier alongside other income-generating investments. Those who participate in the space need to understand the underlying portfolio of a mortgage REIT, with an eye toward quality credit, shorter duration and reasonable yields. ""Make sure they own Treasurys, look for duration that's relatively short, and don't go for the biggest yield,"" said Blancato. ""Each one has its own little niche to it that makes it interesting. If you get it wrong, who cares if you have an 11% dividend yield if you lost 80% of your value in a couple of years."" These REITs shouldn't make up a sizable portion of any given portfolio, based on their risk characteristics. ""It's a sweetener to the coffee, but it's not the coffee,"" said Blancato.",2025-03-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/these-income-generating-stocks-are-beating-the-market-and-offer-rich-yields.html,cnbc
"Rethinking the 60/40 portfolio in an era of volatility, according to Morgan Stanley Investment Management","Investors who rely on a traditional portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds may want to switch their strategy in this environment, according to Jim Caron, Morgan Stanley Investment Management's chief investment officer in the portfolio solutions group. The market has been dealing with bouts of volatility all year, as traders assess the state of the United States economy and the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade policy and increased tariffs . The 60/40 portfolio has mostly worked for the past 10 to 15 years because it is a passive strategy — and one that performs well when bonds have a low correlation to equities, Caron explained. But that has now changed, he said. ""Based on a three year rolling correlation between equities and bonds, correlations for returns are as high as they've ever been in 115 years,"" Caron said. When the correlation is high, bond returns and equity returns move down or up at the same time, he noted. ""What you should be trying to do is match off the volatility of bonds with the volatility of equities,"" he said. ""You should think of that as an active process where it's not '60/40 is the golden ratio.' It could vary."" That could mean 40% bonds and 60% equities , 80/20 or even a 20/80 portfolio, depending on the current environment. By sticking with a passive 60/40, investors could be missing out on returns, Caron warned. For instance, the strategy gave investors about a 7.5% annual return, on average, from about 1981 to 2021, he said. However, if rates move sideways, a bond's return is largely due to the coupon payment rather than price improvement from the duration, he noted. If equities make an estimated 7% return on average, the 60/40 will give you a total return closer to 5%, he said. ""If you compound that over time, if you make a 7% return pretty consistently over time, then by compounding, you would double your money every 10 years,"" Caron explained. ""If you make a 5% return, then you would double your money every 15 years."" How Caron is invested now Right now, Caron's preferred portfolio allocation is 55% stocks and 45% fixed income — but what is in those buckets is just as important. Equities are primarily in the equal-weighted S & P 500, an outlook available to individual investors through the equal-weighted S & P 500 ETF (RSP). ""By definition, we are taking an underweight to large-cap tech, and we're putting an overweight to large-cap value, to mid caps, to the broader segments of the market,"" he said. RSP YTD mountain Invesco S & P 500 Equal Weight ETF in 2025. Mega-cap tech stocks have been battered this year, with the Nasdaq down about 12% from its December record high. Caron also likes European equities right now, which are roughly a large-cap value play. He moved into an overweight position in February after he saw indications of pro-growth policies and deregulation coming from European political leaders. That aggressive rhetoric from politicians is a ""major game changer,"" he said. ""The reindustrialization of Europe is what I see,"" Caron said. ""If you have a reindustrialization, you need energy and you need energy security."" In fixed income, he is taking a barbell approach with high-quality, short-duration bonds and some high-yield exposure. Net/net, the firm is investment grade, he said. Caron sticks with Treasurys, short-term investment-grade corporate bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in his high quality bucket. He also likes non-agency MBS and bank loans.",2025-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/rethinking-60/40-portfolio-in-a-volatile-era-according-to-morgan-stanley.html,cnbc
"These stocks are contenders to start dividends — and have plenty of cash, Morgan Stanley says","Dividend stocks reward investors with the potential for enhanced returns over time, and a few companies may have the wherewithal to start offering the payments, according to Morgan Stanley. A few big names joined the ranks of dividend payers in 2024, led by tech giants Meta Platforms , Alphabet and Salesforce , that began making cash payouts. The income payments themselves were modest to start with — dividend yields remain well below 1% — but Facebook parent Meta already announced a 5% dividend hike in February, to roughly 53 cents per share. Dividends reward long-term shareholders, who have the option of reinvesting them over time, which has the effect of compounding returns . To that end, Morgan Stanley called out a list of companies that may be poised to start spinning out income to investors. ""With the goal of generating new ideas and capturing additional alpha, we've identified companies that should have the ability to pay a dividend (and therefore potentially earn outsized returns),"" strategist Todd Castagno said in a March 6 report. He and his team identified companies that have the potential to soon initiate dividend payments — names that have a net cash position that is greater than 5% of their market capitalization and that generate a free cash flow yield that exceeds 3%. Managed care provider Molina Healthcare made Morgan Stanley's list. Shares are up 8% in 2025, outperforming the S & P 500's decline of nearly 5%. Molina has a free cash flow yield of 10.9%. The stock has come into focus recently as Republican lawmakers weigh cutting spending on Medicaid . However, analysts at Wells Fargo upgraded Molina to overweight from equal weight this month, hiking their price target to $372 from $295. The team thinks major cuts to Medicaid may not be the most likely outcome of efforts to control government spending, and that work requirements for the program ""would not appear problematic for the industry."" ""We think risk/reward has improved, as there are increasing indications that the most disruptive cuts to Medicaid are unlikely to be politically viable and our analysis leaves us comfortable that the more realistic changes would prove manageable for Medicaid [managed care organizations],"" said analyst Stephen Baxter in a March 5 report. Wall Street is largely split on the stock, with seven of 17 analysts rating it the equivalent of a buy, while eight deem it a hold, per LSEG. Cloud communications company Twilio also emerged on Morgan Stanley's list. Shares are off more than 8% in 2025. The company has a free cash flow yield of 4.7%, the bank found. Despite Twilio's difficult start to the year, analysts like the stock. Eighteen of 30 analysts rate it a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG. Late last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall upgraded her rating on Twilio to overweight, lifting her 12-month price target to $160 from $144. She said a sell-off in the stock on the heels of its latest quarterly results was ""overdone"" and that it created an ""attractive buying opportunity"" for investors. ""We see opportunity for both multiple expansion and estimate revision across FY25 as [a] reacceleration story is proven out,"" she wrote in a Feb. 24 report. She pointed to improved cross selling, as well as traction in channels and product innovations, including artificial intelligence. Finally, Morgan Stanley highlighted identity management company Okta . Shares are already up roughly 43% in 2025, and the company has a free cash flow yield of 5.4%, the firm found. Earlier this month, Okta posted fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, and issued first-quarter revenue guidance that surpassed analysts' expectations. ""Okta should be able to reaccelerate growth over the next several quarters as renewal headwinds abate, [Go to Market] strategy is further refined and new products continue to gain traction — driving our positive view on the shares,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a Tuesday report. He also noted that fourth quarter results were ""strong,"" adding that he sees ""a favorable setup through CY25."" Weiss is largely in good company, as 23 out of 41 analysts rate Okta the equivalent of a buy, according to LSEG.

These fixed income assets have yields that top 5%. How to get the most out of them,"As investors hunt for solid yields, many are turning to collateralized loan obligations. The products, which are pools of floating-rate loans to businesses, have seen an uptick in interest. A record $25.6 billion poured into bank loan and CLO exchange-traded funds last year, according to State Street . While the bulk of the market is focused on AAA-rated CLOs, investors may want to think about expanding exposure to other areas within the investment grade category, according to investment management firm VanEck. Assets with a rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or Baa3 or better by Moody's, are considered investment grade and have a lower default risk compared to assets with lower ratings. ""Given that the macro environment and the corporate corporate fundamentals are still strong in the U.S. in particular, there is a case to go into double As, single As, even triple Bs to an extent, to get the additional carry,"" said Bill Sokol, director of product management at VanEck. A recent analysis by the firm found that over the past decade, A-rated CLOs outperformed AAA CLOs by 142 basis points per year — with lower volatility than investment-grade corporate bonds. BBB-rated CLOs beat AAAs by 147 basis points, the analysis found. One reason why CLOs are less volatile than corporate bonds could be tied to CLOs' short duration. That is, their prices are less sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. ""With still getting a super attractive yield versus other investment-grade options, but lower volatility than a lot of high-yield or leveraged-finance options, we think CLOs are still in a sweet spot for this environment"" said Fran Rodilosso, head of fixed income ETF portfolio management at VanEck. Individual investors have largely been drawn to ETFs that hold AAA-rated CLOs, like the Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) . The fund has $22 billion in total net assets. It has a 30-day SEC yield of 5.37% and an expense ratio of 0.2%. However, the AAA-rated CLO ETF space has become crowded, said Kirsten Chang, senior industry analyst at data and analytics company VettaFi. ""There are only so many that you can invest in. So I think people are looking farther along the spectrum,"" she said. A number of issuers have been looking at the space, including VanEck and Eldridge Structured Asset Management, Chang noted. Janus Henderson also has a B-BBB CLO ETF (JBBB) , which as a 30-day SEC yield of 7.34% and 0.48% expense ratio. It has $1.86 billion in total net assets. VanEck's CLO ETF (CLOI) has nearly 18% in AAA-rated CLOs and nearly 22% in AA-rated. It has about 10% in A-rated and less than 8% in BBB. The ETF has a 30-day yield of 5.65% and an expense ratio of 0.4%. ""You can get much better yield potential and better total return opportunities by taking a more active approach that focuses on still high quality,"" Sokol said. CLOI YTD mountain VanEck CLO ETF In the fall, the firm launched the VanEck AA-BB CLO ETF (CLOB), which invests primarily in the AA- to BB-rated tranches. It has a 6.6% 30-day SEC yield and a 0.45% expense ratio. There is some more risk involved as you move down in ratings. However, moving below AAA but staying within investment grade isn't necessarily a big risk, VettaFi's Chang said. ""Considering how stable certain aspects of the market still are, despite the concerns about tariffs and rising inflation and the jobs market, I think we're still at a decent point in the economy where you don't have to worry about credit risk in a big way moving just slightly down that spectrum,"" she said. For the team at VanEck, selectivity is key, especially with the uncertainty in the markets right now. The firm's active approach focuses not only on relative value within the tranches, but also on individual security selection by looking at areas such as managers and underlying portfolios.

"This ETF is a ‘standout’, according to Morningstar — and provides tax-free income","Investors looking for tax-free income have a variety of choices when it comes to municipal bond funds — but Capital Group Municipal Income ETF (CGMU) is among the top performers, according to Morningstar. The exchange-traded fund, which launched in 2022, has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.35% and an expense ratio of 0.27%. The income earned by investors is exempt from federal taxes. In fact, municipal bonds' tax advantage makes them a favored investment of the wealthy. ""So far, this core-plus approach to the muni market has been a standout,"" Morningstar associate director Elizabeth Foos wrote on Feb. 28 . She praised its ""seasoned management team and a well-articulated, research-heavy investment strategy."" CGMU YTD mountain Capital Group Municipal Income ETF The ETF is ranked in the top quartile in Morningstar's muni intermediate fund category year to date, and was as well in 2023 and 2024. There are three managers on the fund, including Courtney Wolf, CGMU's principal investment officer. They all have different areas of expertise and each expresses their highest conviction ideas for the ETF, Wolf said in an interview with CNBC. They also lean on a team of analysts and traders to help in individual security selection, she said. Morningstar said the fund's ample resources are solid. ""The team has access to efficient data, research, and trading coordination, which allows it to be nimble when positioning the portfolio,"" Foos said. ""Yet a few long-standing themes add stability: The portfolio favors revenue bonds with strong, consistent cash streams and it avoids leverage, which can add to volatility."" These days, muni investors are getting paid solid yields. A muni bond with yield of 3.5% is going to have a taxable-equivalent yield north of 6% for those in the highest tax bracket, Wolf explained. ""The muni market is on sound footing, largely speaking, from a fundamental standpoint, and that's a result of what's been a strong economic environment,"" she said. While markets have been rocky in the face of uncertainty around the Trump administration's tariffs and the economy, Wolf looks beyond the near-term volatility. ""Volatility helps us generate alpha because it gives us opportunities,"" she said. ""As active managers, we don't mind volatility, but we really think long term and build portfolios for clients with that long-term horizon in mind."" Finding opportunity Credit spreads in the muni market have narrowed a lot, similar to what is happening in the taxable market, Wolf noted. ""I like this up-in-quality tilt, because you can move into higher quality and you don't give [up] a lot of yield,"" she said. She also looks at bond structure, in other words, those with a feature that makes it slightly quirky or difficult to analyze. ""It might be the coupon, the call, the maturity, the combination of things that make bond structure, something where you get compensated a lot for that,"" Wolf said. For instance, CGMU has holdings in planned amortization bonds, which provides exposure to the housing market largely through agency mortgage-backed securities, Wolf said. ""It's double A, triple A quality, but you pick up that extra compensation because there is a little bit of uncertainty around cash flows."" she explained. ""It's a little bit complicated to manage."" Wolf noted that housing is one area that is interesting right now from a relative value standpoint. Yet, it is just one part of the larger pie. The fund managers make a lot of small relative value decisions that add up over time, she said. ""It's going to be an interesting year,"" Wolf said. ""I suspect there will be a lot of opportunities to add value for active managers, which I think is super exciting.""",2025-03-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/this-etf-is-a-standout-according-to-morningstar-and-provides-tax-free-income.html,cnbc
Morningstar likes these solid dividend payers when markets get choppy,"Investors seeking solid dividend income as the S & P 500 continues its retreat from record highs may want to take a closer look at a few select real estate investment trusts. The real estate sector is little changed in 2025, beating the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors that are down by double digits. ""I think real estate is showing up as a bright spot because the 10-year Treasury yield has come down,"" Morningstar senior equity analyst Kevin Brown told CNBC. ""When rates have come down, the real estate sector has outperformed. When they have gone up, the sector has underperformed versus the S & P 500."" Indeed, the benchmark yield was around 4.8% in January, but on Thursday was trading at about 4.27%. Real estate investment trusts are particularly sensitive to interest rates because higher rates raise borrowing costs for REITs, and make REITs' dividend yields less attractive to income investors compared to the risk-free rate on Treasurys. But investors should be aware that not all REITs equal. They'll have to discern among different corners of the sector, with some areas having stronger tailwinds than others. ""The health-care REITs in particular [and] senior housing REITs have done very well over the past two to three years,"" Brown said. ""They have gone from not just recovering from the pandemic, but they've also seen very strong growth as the boomer generation ages into the target demographic for the sector."" On the opposite end of the spectrum, some subsectors of REITs have seen earnings slow. ""Self storage – they were reporting double-digit net operating income growth [NOI] in '22, and now it's negative NOI growth. They have fallen off,"" Brown added. The analyst shared three names that he likes – and that income-oriented investors may come to appreciate in today's rocky market: Realty Income , Federal Realty and Healthpeak Properties . A pair of dividend aristocrats Realty Income and Federal Realty made the grade because of their solid track record of dividend payments. Both names are dividend aristocrats, meaning they've been raising their dividends each year for at least the past 25 years. ""They have a historical precedent of 'Hey, we pay a consistent, growing dividend. We have a track record of doing this every single year. We've gone through the pandemic, the financial crisis of '08 and '09, and we're still able to pay a dividend and grow it,'"" Brown said. ""They aren't anywhere close to having that dividend get squeezed, and we think those two are trading at a 20% to 25% discount to their fair value,"" he added. Realty Income is a triple net lease REIT, meaning its tenants are on the hook for real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance expenses. The company's tenants include 7-Eleven and Dollar General. In the fourth quarter, Realty Income's adjusted funds from operations — a REIT's equivalent of earnings per share — came in at $1.05, short of the $1.06 per share anticipated by analysts polled by FactSet. But revenue of $1.34 billion topped the expected $1.28 billion. ""Management provided guidance that was relatively in line with our expectations,"" said Brown in a recent report. ""Same-store [net operating income] growth is expected to be approximately 1.0% in 2025, which is slightly below our 1.5% estimate but not materially different."" Shares are up about 5% in 2025, and Realty Income offers a dividend yield of 5.7%. Most analysts covering the stock have a hold rating, according to LSEG. Federal Realty, whose tenants include TJX Companies ' HomeGoods unit, and Starbucks , has a dividend yield of 4.6%. Shares are down about 15% in 2025, but the REIT is liked on Wall Street, with 13 of 17 analysts rating it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Management recently highlighted two new projects: A redevelopment of a residential property in Hoboken, N.J. and a redevelopment of the Andorra Shopping Center in Philadelphia. ""We are encouraged by the projected yields on the projects, given that we assume the company can achieve 7.0% yields on future development projects,"" Brown said in a recent report. Health-care trends Healthpeak Properties, whose portfolio includes Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and the Hayden Research Campus in Lexington, Mass., offers investors a dividend yield of 6%. Shares are about flat in 2025, but analysts largely deem it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Brown said that giant pharmaceutical companies will likely still want lab space even if there were a recession, although net operating income growth may not be as strong in that scenario. ""Healthpeak is offering stable NOI growth – that isn't exciting – but all of a sudden when sectors start looking at decelerating NOI growth, stable looks attractive,"" Brown said.",2025-03-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/morningstar-likes-these-solid-dividend-payers-when-markets-get-choppy.html,cnbc
"Boost your portfolio returns with stocks that pay special dividends, Morgan Stanley says","Dividend-paying stocks are getting some attention from Wall Street as recession worries and anxiety over President Donald Trump 's tariff policy rattles the market. This is only the second week of March, but the S & P 500 is already off more than 5% in the month, while the Nasdaq Composite is toting a 6.5% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below its 200-day moving average on Monday for the first time since November 2023. Dividends can give investors some cushioning when tumultuous markets shake up their portfolios. ""Dividends can help reduce volatility in a time of greater uncertainty and geopolitical risks,"" wrote Todd Castagno, a strategist for Morgan Stanley. ""In periods of slow growth, dividends become more important and make up a larger percentage of investors' total returns."" In particular, special dividend issuers – that is, companies that can make one-time payments to shareholders outside of their regular dividend cycle – can also offer investors a boost. This cohort has beaten the market by 4.1% in the six months following the announcement of the special dividend, Castagno found. This outperformance grew to 7.8% in the 12-month period following the news. That effect is magnified for small cap names, as those that announced special dividends beat the market by 5.7% in the six-month period following the news and by 11.1% in the 12-month period after. ""Committing to a consistent, ordinary dividend sends a positive signal to the market, conveys management's confidence in the business, and opens the stock to income oriented investors,"" Castagno wrote, ""while special dividends are a bonus – implying optimism attributable to M & A synergies, secular tailwinds and/or an extraordinary series of events."" Morgan Stanley shared a list of stocks that paid special dividends over the last 12 months. Here are a few of the names. Paccar , a designer of large commercial trucks, made the grade. In December, the company's board of directors declared an additional cash dividend of $3 a share, payable on Jan. 8. It has a current dividend yield of 1.2%, and shares are down about 7% over the past 12 months. Wall Street is largely neutral on the name, with 12 of the 21 analysts covering the stock rating it hold and seven deeming it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Bank of America is among the shops that are upbeat on Paccar, upgrading it to buy in January. ""We forecast PCAR delivering a new peak EPS of $10.25 in '26e ($1 above consensus) as freight conditions recover & customers purchase trucks ahead of EPA27 [an emissions regulation],"" wrote analyst Michael Feniger, adding that the PCAR dividend is ""likely to screen quite attractive in 2026."" Insurer American Financial Group was another highlight on Morgan Stanley's list. In late February, the company announced a special dividend of $2 a share , payable on March 28. That payment is in addition to AFG's regular dividend of 80 cents a share. The insurer also said that it repurchased about $50 million of its common stock year to date through Feb. 27. AFG has a dividend yield of 2.5%, and shares are off roughly 2.5% in the past 12 months. Analysts largely deem the name a hold, according to LSEG. Piper Sandler's Paul Newsome, who is neutral on the stock, last month noted that AFG ""is an example of a company with a high class problem."" ""Its underwriting profitability and [return on equity] are excellent, but it is difficult in an increasingly competitive market to maintain those returns,"" he said. The analyst added that while his team thinks returns on an absolute basis should be ""very good,"" AFG ""likely has limited earnings growth for the foreseeable future."" Other names that made it to Morgan Stanley's list include timberland real estate investment trust Rayonier , which has a dividend yield of 4%; property casualty insurer RLI , with a dividend yield of 0.8%; and CNA Financial , with a 3.8% current dividend yield.",2025-03-11 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/boost-your-portfolio-returns-with-stocks-that-pay-special-dividends-morgan-stanley-says.html,cnbc
Where Janus Henderson sees opportunity for income in 2025,"Allocating to fixed-income sectors that are trading at cheaper relative valuations will be key for investors this year, according to Janus Henderson. That means looking beyond investment-grade credit, Treasurys and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, said John Lloyd, lead of the firm's multi-sector credit strategies and portfolio manager. ""Yields are still compelling overall, but spreads are very tight across a lot of sectors,"" he said. Spreads measure the difference in yield between Treasurys and other fixed income assets of the same maturity. Securitized credit and bank loans were among the outperformers in fixed income last year, according to Janus Henderson. Still, even with that strong showing, yields remain solid versus historical yields, inflation expectations and the forward earnings yield of the S & P 500 , Lloyd noted. ""Over a year period, even if you do hit rough spots, it's much harder to get a negative return with those starting yields,"" Lloyd said. Among the funds he manages is the Janus Henderson Multi-Sector Income Fund (JMUIX) , which seeks high income with lower volatility than a high-yield strategy. It has a 30-day SEC yield of 6.39% and a net expense ratio of 0.68% JMUIX 1Y mountain Janus Henderson Multi-Sector Income Fund Corporate bond alternatives Lloyd would look at collateralized loan obligations and asset-backed securities instead of investment-grade corporate bonds. CLOs are securitized pools of floating rate loans to businesses, although not all are investment grade. So-called ABS are backed by a pool of income-generating assets such as auto loans and credit card receivables. Within CLOs, Lloyd prefers the higher-rated securities, such as AAA, AA and A ratings. Investors can get 120 basis point spreads on new issues these days, he said, noting that this surpasses what investors might see with investment-grade credit. ""You're getting almost double the spread for very similar volatility,"" he said. In addition, AAA has a higher rating than that of the investment-grade index, which is a BBB, he said. The Multi-Sector Income Fund has roughly 13% of its allocation in CLOs, as of Jan. 31. The firm also has its Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) , which currently has a 5.37% 30-day SEC yield and a 0.2% expense ratio. JAAA 1Y mountain Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF In general, Lloyd invests across the ABS market, although he hasn't focused on student loans and solar. Overall, the consumer is still pretty healthy and underwriting has remained stringent in the space, he noted. The assets also tend to have shorter durations than investment-grade credit, Lloyd said. Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates, and longer-dated issues tend to have greater duration. ""Even if unemployment starts slipping, you're still paying those down and they're shorter in maturity, so you're pretty well protected there,"" he said of the ABS market. The Multi-Sector Income Fund has roughly 15% of its allocation in these assets. In 2024, AAA-rated CLOs had a total return of 7.1% and ABS had a 5% total return, according to Janus Henderson. In contrast, investment-grade corporates had a total return of 2.1% Opting for loans over high yield Bank loans look attractive over high-yield bonds because investors are getting spreads that are a little bit wider in loans for the same level of ratings, Lloyd said. ""The tradeoff there is convexity, because in the loan market, at the beginning of the year, you had a 70% of loans trading above par, and you can get repriced,"" he said. ""Our view is, if high yield is trading at the first percentile and there's not much spread outside there, that convexity doesn't matter as much. So let's pick up the spread."" Convexity is a measure of the relationship to bond prices and bond yields. Loans also have lower volatility than high-yield bonds, he added. Both asset classes performed well last year, with bank loans seeing a total return of 8.75% and high-yield returning 8.2%. Agency MBS Instead of allocating to Treasurys, investors can add exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities, which are also backed by the government, said Lloyd. The agency MBS asset class had a ""perfect storm"" over the last couple of years as the Federal Reserve started reducing its holdings in them and banks largely excited the market as well, he pointed out. They are also cheap compared to corporate bonds, he added. ""You're picking up some really good carry versus corporates that we historically haven't had in the mortgage market,"" Lloyd said. ""Our view is we'd see a little bit of tightening,"" he added. ""Even if the agency market didn't tighten, in this type of environment where spreads are really tight, you're not taking credit risk and it provides a good diversification benefit as well in a multi-sector income portfolio.""",2025-03-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/where-janus-henderson-sees-opportunity-for-income-in-2025.html,cnbc
Money market funds have grown to a record $7 trillion. Here are the biggest ones and the yields they're paying,"Americans are flocking to cash amid the market turmoil, with money market fund assets hitting a record $7.03 trillion as of the week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute . Markets have been rocky of late as investors grapple with uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariffs and their impact on the economy. ""Recent strong inflows may be a response to the spike in volatility in the financial markets we've seen lately,"" said Shelly Antoniewicz, ICI chief economist. ""With short-term interest rates still at elevated levels historically, money market funds — which pass earned interest on to their shareholders — are relatively more attractive to both institutional and retail investors."" Retail investors added $30.35 billion to money market funds in the week ended Wednesday, bringing their total assets to $2.84 trillion, according to ICI. Institutional money market funds saw assets rise during the period by $20.8 billion to $4.19 trillion. Yields on money market funds — which once topped 5% — are down from their highs, but they still remain attractive. The annualized seven-day yield on the Crane 100 list of the 100 largest taxable money funds is currently 4.16%. Peter Crane, founder of money market tracking firm Crane Data, thinks the inflows into money markets have largely been driven by a shift away from lower-paying bank deposits. Here are the largest taxable money market funds for retail investors, according to Crane. Optimizing cash holdings Still, investors should mind their cash allocations carefully, UBS said in a note Friday. Rates on cash-equivalent assets can drop sharply if there is surprise weakness in economic data, strategist Vince Heaney warned. ""Amid falling interest rates in Europe and potential risks to economic growth in the US, we believe investors holding excess cash should seek more diverse and durable sources of portfolio income,"" he wrote. In fact, cash underperforms other asset classes on a long-term basis, he said. Stocks have beaten cash in 86% and 100% of all 10- and 20-year holding periods, respectively, Heaney noted. Equities have topped cash by more than 200 times overall in terms of returns since 1926, he added. In a 12-month holding period, bonds have outperformed cash 65% of the time. That rises to 82% over a five-year period, 85% over 10 years and 90% over 20 years, Heaney said. People should have money stashed in a cash-equivalent account for any liquid needs, including an emergency fund and any potential big purchases coming up. Money market funds and high-yield savings provide liquidity, but have rates that can fluctuate. Investors can lock in rates with certificates of deposit, but they should be aware that there are penalties for early withdrawals. One way to stagger liquidity is to build a CD ladder of varying maturities. How to boost income There are several ways investors can increase income in their portfolio right now, UBS' Heaney said. First, high-grade and investment-grade bonds offer a compelling risk-reward, he said. Heaney expects mid- to high-single-digit returns for medium-duration bonds in U.S. dollar terms over the next 12 months. Investors can also spread exposure to higher-yielding fixed income, private credit , senior loans and equity income while managing risks, Heaney suggested. For those who need money in more than a year's time, short-dated fixed income may be an option that could offer better risk-adjusted returns than cash, he said.",2025-03-07 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/money-market-funds-have-grown-to-a-record-7-trillion-in-assets.html,cnbc
BlackRock says investors should look beyond the noise and grab attractive income in these assets,"Investors looking for income should block out the ""noise"" rocking the markets these days — and look beyond traditional fixed-income holdings for attractive yields, according to BlackRock's Russell Brownback. Concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs have caused market volatility and some teetering in the 10-year Treasury yield. However, the underpinnings of the economy are still profoundly solid, he said. ""You've got a structurally tight labor market. You've got a private sector balance sheet that is pristine. You've got wealth levels at record highs outright and versus incomes,"" said Brownback, head of BlackRock's global macro positioning team within fixed income. The artificial-intelligence revolution is causing infrastructure build out, which should continue through the rest of the decade, and productivity enhancements are in early innings, he said. ""There's going to be noise about policy implementation, but we feel pretty good about the underpinnings of the economy today, in ways that will keep the credit cycle fairly benign,"" Brownback said. Income rather than duration He prefers looking outside of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index, which tracks U.S. investment-grade bonds, because the fixed-income regime has changed. Brownback also noted that the Treasury market faces risks due to policy and inflation uncertainties. ""Fixed income, to us today, is about income as opposed to duration,"" Brownback said. ""These strategies that can move away from these traditional benchmark holdings are really the way to optimize the regime."" Duration is a measurement of a bond's price sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates. Longer-dated bonds tend to be more sensitive to sharp swings in rates. Brownback has been at BlackRock since 2009 but his working relationship with Rick Rieder , the firm's chief investment officer of global fixed income, goes back even further. The pair has worked together for 30 years, first at Lehman Brothers and then at R3 Capital Partners before coming to BlackRock. In addition to working on the firm's multi-sector fixed-income strategies, Brownback is a portfolio manager on the BlackRock Strategic Income Opportuniti es Fund (BASIX) . The fund has three stars and a gold rating from Morningstar. It has a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47% and a net expense ratio of 0.99%. The fund's institutional shares has four stars and a gold rating from Morningstar. BASIX 1Y mountain BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (A shares) High-quality securitized assets More than a quarter of the fund's assets is in securitized products, Brownback's favorite area to invest right now. Some 6.8% of the assets are in non-agency mortgage-backed securities and 6.1% is in commercial MBS . Another 5.7% is in asset-backed securities , and 8.5% is in collateralized loan obligations . ""There is so much idiosyncratic opportunity there,"" he said. Brownback takes a barbell approach when investing in securitized products. ""By and large, very high-quality, short-dated, triple-A parts of the cap stack across all those sub-asset classes screen very cheaply to us relative to corporate credit,"" he said. On the lower-rated side, he sticks with single-asset, single-borrower positions within commercial mortgage backed securities. ""That is really going to be geography dependent. It's going to be property dependent,"" he said. There are also select opportunities in high-yield bonds in the U.S., Europe and Asia, Brownback said. These corporate bonds have become an increasingly high-quality asset class, particularly in the United States, he noted. The ICE BofA US High Yield Index was composed of about 35% BB-rated bonds and 20% in CCC about 15 years ago and today, it is over 50% BB and only 10% CCC, he said. While he isn't allocating much to investment-grade credit , he has some holdings in European investment grade. The currency conversion to U.S. dollars can be very attractive and the technicals are very good, he said. The fund also has about 22% in agency residential mortgages. They look cheap historically compared to investment-grade credit, but they are suffering from some negative technicals, he said. The asset class has negative convexity, which is a measure of the relationship to bond prices and bond yields, he said. ""We don't think rates are going too far in either direction, so that negative convexity won't be realized,"" Brownback said. ""We actually think there's a little bit better value in what is a highly liquid sector than the investment-grade market. But of course, we're going to dynamically pivot back and forth between those opportunistically.""",2025-03-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/blackrock-says-investors-can-grab-attractive-income-in-these-assets.html,cnbc
These funds offer investors attractive income – if they’re willing to make a few tradeoffs,"A high-yielding play is getting its moment in the sun as investors look to beef up their ability to generate income and aim to minimize volatility. Enter the interval fund , a structure that holds private credit and other income-generating assets that are less liquid than what's found in an exchange-traded fund. Because of the nature of their holdings, these funds can't be sold at will — instead, they have windows of liquidity through share repurchases typically offered once a quarter. The funds can also use leverage to help boost their income, resulting in yields that are in the 9% to 11% range, according to Brian Moriarty, principal, fixed income strategies at Morningstar. ""More recently, people realized these are potentially a perfect vehicle to offer private credit and other private assets to retail investors – regular investors who otherwise don't get access because if you want to buy into a private credit fund, you have to be an accredited investor,"" he said. Accredited investors need to have a net worth over $1 million, excluding their private residence, and income over $200,000 (individually) or $300,000 (with a spouse or partner) in each of the past two years. Asset managers have been taking steps to democratize investing in private credit lately, with State Street and Apollo Global Management recently launching the SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) . On the interval fund front, Capital Group and KKR have teamed up on two prospective interval funds , having recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer them. An illiquidity premium The difference between offering regular liquidity via an ETF versus quarterly liquidity in an interval fund can result in a premium for investors who are willing to stay put. ""We think about private credit and private markets as a way to generate additional income, a premium to what you can get in the public market,"" said Matthew Bass, head of private alternatives at AllianceBernstein. The firm offers the AB CarVal Credit Opportunities Fund (ABAYX) , an interval fund that invests in different private credit opportunities, ranging from specialty finance to aviation leasing. ABAYX is a new offering, launched in February 2024 and paying a distribution yield of 7.29%, but it also has an adjusted net expense ratio of 1.98%, according to the fund's website. Financial advisors have also been interested in private credit exposure, according to Peter Blue, head of alternative solutions with Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. ""Advisors are seeking interval funds as an operationally easier way to access less-liquid markets,"" he said. The firm offers the Franklin BSP Private Credit Fund (FBPAX) , which debuted in 2022. The fund has a distribution rate of 7.89% and a net expense ratio of 4.78%. Financial advisors who have dipped a toe into the space said that interval funds can be an effective tool for income-focused clients who bring a long-term mindset to their portfolio and have ample assets elsewhere for liquidity needs. ""I think of it as a couple years' commitment to the fund,"" said Thomas Balcom, certified financial planner and founder of 1650 Wealth Management in Lighthouse Point, Florida. ""Most people say they're long-term investors and that's fine, but there is always a case where the client might need money: death, divorce, the loss of a job,"" he said. ""You want to make sure they're aware of the lock up."" Be sure to kick the tires As more interval funds hit the scene, investors will need to perform some due diligence before they hop in. ""If you have, for example, a 1% to 5% allocation to an interval fund, are you going to need that in the next three months?"" said Ben Loughery, CFP at Lock Wealth Management in Atlanta. ""I would imagine your financial advisor has the other 95% of your portfolio or other parts of your portfolio earmarked for immediate cash needs."" The fees can also be on the hefty side versus mutual funds and ETFs. A 2024 study co-authored by Morningstar's Moriarty found that the average prospectus adjusted expense ratio across all interval fund share classes is 2.49%. That compares to 0.58% for ETFs and 0.99% for mutual funds. ""The math works the same there as it does elsewhere: If there are higher fees, it's more likely ... the total return will be lower,"" Moriarty said. He also recommended investors dig through the marketing materials and understand what they're buying into – and know why they're buying it. ""You can't make that investment on a whim; you're stuck with it for at least a quarter,"" Moriarty added.",2025-03-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/these-funds-offer-investors-solid-income-but-come-with-a-few-tradeoffs.html,cnbc
Goldman Sachs rolls out suite of downside protection ETFs as market volatility picks up,"s Goldman Sachs Asset Management has thrown its hat into the ring of increasingly popular buffer exchange-traded funds, just as the stock market is showing some signs of fragility. On Tuesday, the firm announced the launch of the Goldman Sachs U.S. Large Cap Buffer 3 ETF (GBXC). That follows two similar funds that launched in recent months. Each fund resets on a quarterly basis, meaning investors now have a fresh version to choose from every month. Buffer funds fall into a category called defined outcome products that has attracted billions of dollars from investors in recent years. Buffer funds use derivatives, often in the form of equity-linked notes, to trade off some potential upside in the market for downside protection. There is a wide variety of buffer funds on the market, with various levels of protection and upside participation. In the case of the new Goldman funds, they will protect against losses from 5% to 15% in the market, represented by the underlying SPDR Portfolio S & P 500 ETF (SPLG) . In exchange, the funds have upside caps of between 5% and 7%. Brendan McCarthy, global head of ETF distribution at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the firm believes that the 5% to 15% range is the ""sweet spot."" ""The feedback we were getting from clients was, I'm in the marketplace. I can live with down a few percent. That's kind of like what I expect. It gets painful when I'm talking down 5 to down 15,"" McCarthy said. Two key differences with the Goldman funds from other buffer funds is that most of the competitors reset annually instead of quarterly, and the Goldman funds have an additional floor built in. In addition to the 5%-15% protection band, the funds have an extra buffer that kicks in when the market is down roughly 25%, limiting total possible losses in each outcome period to approximately 15%. How the funds work Buffer funds are designed to be bought on or very near to the reset date and held throughout the entire period. The price of the fund can fall by more than the buffer zone indicates during the interim period, based on how options pricing changes over time. ""You could show a loss in your position, but as long as you hold on to it to the next reset, then you'll get the published parameters,"" said Stuart Chaussee, a registered investment advisor based in Beverly Hills, California, who regularly uses buffer ETFs from multiple fund issuers. While the funds are designed for each outcome period, their impacts can compound over time if investors hold them through multiple resets. For example, if the market falls sharply one quarter but rallies the next, the rally in a buffer fund would come from a higher starting place. ""These are meant to basically kind of help you to sink less deeply to help you recover faster,"" said Oliver Bunn, portfolio manager and global head of the quantitative investment strategies alternatives team within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Of course, the same is true in the opposite case. The performance of a buffer fund would suffer over time if the market was steadily climbing and exceeding the upside cap. Some of the biggest other players in the buffer fund space are Innovator, First Trust and Allianz. The new Goldman Sachs funds have a 0.50% fee, which is cheaper than many of the largest buffer funds already on the market.

The index is now 4.84% below its record highs. .SPX YTD mountain The S & P 500 is off to a rough start in 2025. Chaussee said clients often come to him asking about buffer funds when volatility picks up. ""With all the uncertainty that we have now and the fact that stocks are trading at lofty multiples, that's when you may well have some protection on,"" Chaussee said.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management has thrown its hat into the ring of increasingly popular buffer exchange-traded funds, just as the stock market is showing some signs of fragility. On Tuesday, the firm announced the launch of the Goldman Sachs U.S. Large Cap Buffer 3 ETF (GBXC). That follows two similar funds that launched in recent months. Each fund resets on a quarterly basis, meaning investors now have a fresh version to choose from every month.

Buffer funds fall into a category called defined outcome products that has attracted billions of dollars from investors in recent years. Buffer funds use derivatives, often in the form of equity-linked notes, to trade off some potential upside in the market for downside protection. There is a wide variety of buffer funds on the market, with various levels of protection and upside participation. In the case of the new Goldman funds, they will protect against losses from 5% to 15% in the market, represented by the underlying SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) . In exchange, the funds have upside caps of between 5% and 7%. Brendan McCarthy, global head of ETF distribution at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the firm believes that the 5% to 15% range is the ""sweet spot."" ""The feedback we were getting from clients was, I'm in the marketplace. I can live with down a few percent. That's kind of like what I expect. It gets painful when I'm talking down 5 to down 15,"" McCarthy said. Two key differences with the Goldman funds from other buffer funds is that most of the competitors reset annually instead of quarterly, and the Goldman funds have an additional floor built in. In addition to the 5%-15% protection band, the funds have an extra buffer that kicks in when the market is down roughly 25%, limiting total possible losses in each outcome period to approximately 15%.

How the funds work

Buffer funds are designed to be bought on or very near to the reset date and held throughout the entire period. The price of the fund can fall by more than the buffer zone indicates during the interim period, based on how options pricing changes over time. ""You could show a loss in your position, but as long as you hold on to it to the next reset, then you'll get the published parameters,"" said Stuart Chaussee, a registered investment advisor based in Beverly Hills, California, who regularly uses buffer ETFs from multiple fund issuers.

Private credit is becoming more accessible to retail investors. What to know about this booming asset class,"A new exchange-traded fund is bringing private credit to the masses and could open the door to more products following suit. The ETF from State Street and Apollo Global Management, SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) , launched last Thursday . It aims to have at least 80% of its assets in investment-grade private and public debt securities. Still, there are some lingering questions about the fund and what it means for access to private credit moving forward. After the ETF started trading Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission in a letter on its website highlighted ""significant remaining outstanding issues"" on the fund, including the use of Apollo's name in the title and the ability to comply with valuation rules. On Friday, State Street said it would revise the name of the fund as soon as practical. The company also explained the ETF's illiquid products won't be exclusively tied to Apollo and that its net asset value will be calculated daily. State Street told CNBC it would have no further comment at this time. Morningstar said the ETF represents a ""seismic shift"" in the industry. ""We eagerly await what sort of firms will follow suit and try to launch some sort of copycat vehicle,"" said Ryan Jackson, senior manager research analyst at Morningstar. ""This is truly a first-of-its-kind product and I think one can safely assume there's a lot of latent demand for true private assets in an ETF vehicle."" Sizing up liquidity The roadblock to this sort of product has been the illiquid nature of private credit. ETFs are typically allowed to have up to 15% in illiquid investments. With PRIV, private credit can range between 10% and 35% of its assets, although it can go below or above that. In order to provide the liquidity needed for the fund, Apollo not only provides the assets but will also repurchase them if needed. ""What we're most interested in is what kind of precedent does that set for ETF providers moving forward to who want to flip some private investments,"" Jackson said. ""If State Street and Apollo can do it with sort of a soft cap, does that same set of rules apply to every other provider?"" Investors should also be aware that the liquidity comes at a price, said Neal Epstein, vice president of private credit at Moody's Ratings. ""If Apollo is setting the prices and making the market, it seems like there could be, implicitly, a conflict. It may not be the fairest outcome, but if people really want liquidity, you do expect prices to change dramatically in favor of the acquirer,"" he said. ""That's what it means to seek liquidity. You're willing to give up the price."" Still, he called the fund ""a big, incremental step"" in the expansion of private credit as an asset class. With an expense ratio of 0.70%, it is a lot cheaper than traditional private credit allocations, Jackson said. ""Anytime the price tag is cheaper, that's great for investors. But you have to wonder, are they getting the third, fourth, fifth best ideas, while the absolute best deal available for any given private credit provider kind of goes to their top-paying clients,"" he said. Appetite for private credit Moody's predicts global private credit assets under management (AUM) will reach $3 trillion by 2028. While that is largely from institutional investors, individual investors have been showing more interest in recent years. ""Expansion of retail private debt AUM has been accelerating and, while still less than 20% of total private debt AUM, is growing at a faster pace than institutional AUM,"" Moody's Ratings wrote in its global private credit outlook for 2025. Separately, an MSCI report released in January said that 82% of wealth managers globally expect to make larger allocations to private assets, including private credit. The firm surveyed 20 wealth industry professionals in June 2024. Consider that the BondBloxx Private Credit CLO ETF (PCMM), which launched in December, offers liquidity because it focuses on private collateralized debt obligations. The ETF, which has a 30-day SEC yield of 7.44% and a 0.68% expense ratio, has since grown to $63.5 million in net assets . Investors in the ETF also get the benefit of diversification, said Tony Kelly, co-founder at BondBloxx. The ETF currently owns 42 CLOs. ""There's also diversification, even like the next layer down, that each CLO owns, on average, about 100 different loans,"" he said. ""So you're looking at about 4,000 different different loans."" PCMM has about 80% of its assets invested in private credit. The weighted average rating is an A and duration is only about a quarter of a year, Kelly said. Investors can also get private credit exposure through interval funds and other ETFs, like Virtus Private Credit Strategy (VPC) , said Morningstar's Jackson. The latter tracks the Indxx Private Credit Index, which provides passive exposure to private credit. The index holds assets such as business development companies (BDCs), which lend money to businesses, and closed-end funds. These assets are ""one layer removed from the real deal,"" Jackson said. Meanwhile, BondBloxx registered for another ETF in December that will offer private credit exposure to consumer-type loans, or fin-tech loans, Kelly said. It is awaiting approval from the SEC. On the equity side, investors can buy shares of the BDCs themselves. They include names like Blue Owl Capital , Oaktree Specialty Lending and Ares Capital . —CNBC's Bob Pisani contributed reporting.",2025-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/03/what-to-know-about-investing-in-private-credit.html,cnbc
"Earnings season is winding down, and these S&P 500 companies have hiked their dividends","Stocks have been on a rocky ride to start the year, but income investors have a silver lining: Companies have continued to announce dividend increases. The S & P 500 limped through February, losing 1.4%, with concerns over inflation, President Donald Trump's impending tariffs and worsening geopolitical risks weighing on investor sentiment. On Friday, the broad-based index briefly slipped into negative territory for 2025. Still, companies have been reporting their fourth-quarter reports – providing another market catalyst. As of Friday, about 97% of the S & P 500 reported earnings, with more than 75% surpassing analysts' estimates, per FactSet. Several of those S & P 500 names were bearing good news for income investors. In the week ended Feb. 25, there were 20 S & P 500 companies that announced dividend hikes, according to data from JPMorgan. There were no new cuts or suspensions announced in that time, the firm said. Heavy hitters announcing dividend hikes include Coca-Cola , which boosted its payout by about 5.2% to 51 cents per share. ""Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend, as we've done for 62 consecutive years,"" said John Murphy, chief financial officer of Coca-Cola, on the company's Feb. 11 earnings call. ""Our dividend is supported by our long-term free cash flow generation. In 2024, dividends paid as a percent of adjusted free cash flow was 73%,"" he added. Other big names that have joined the ranks as of late include Occidental Petroleum , Home Depot and General Motors . Dividend raises in 2025 Year to date through Feb. 18, more than 80 S & P 500 companies announced dividend increases, according to data from S & P Dow Jones Indices. See below for a few of the names that raised their income payments. Semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices lifted its quarterly dividend payment by 8% to 99 cents a share . The stock is holding up in what's been a rough patch for tech names, up more than 6% in 2025. The tech sector of the S & P 500 is off 6% year to date. This hike marks the 21st consecutive year of higher dividends for Analog Devices. The stock has a current dividend yield of 1.7%. Benchmark Equity Research initiated coverage of the stock earlier this month with a buy rating and a price target of $245, reflecting more than 9% upside from Thursday's close. ""We believe ADI is one of the most attractive opportunities across the high-performance analog semiconductor landscape, uniquely positioned to drive sustained growth, margin expansion and compelling shareholder returns,"" wrote analyst David Williams. ""Significant cash generating model and generous capital allocation strategy targets return of 100% of [free cash flow] to shareholders,"" he added. Of the 32 analysts covering Analog Devices, 20 rate it a buy or strong buy, and consensus price targets call for upside of 13%, according to LSEG. Walmart , a dividend aristocrat – that is, a name that raised dividends for at least 25 years, announced a 52nd year of dividend hikes. The big-box store lifted its dividend by 13% to 94 cents a share – or four quarterly payments of $0.235 per share. The company posted beats on the top and bottom lines in the fiscal fourth quarter, but it warned that profit growth will slow . This cued a 6.5% slide for Walmart shares after the retailer issued its results. ""Cash flow remained strong. And as we announced this morning, we're pleased to raise the dividend by 13% this year, the largest increase in over a decade, reinforcing our commitment to strong cash returns to shareholders,"" said CFO John David Rainey on Walmart's earnings call. The Street was also unfazed by the post-earnings slip in shares, with JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers calling it a ""Near-Term Buying Opportunity."" He rates it overweight, saying its U.S. same-store sales growth is ""high quality"" as Walmart continues to gain market share. Analysts are sticking by the stock, with 41 out of 43 rating it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Consensus price targets see 12% upside from current levels. Walmart shares are up more than 8% in 2025, and the stock has a current dividend yield of 1%. Shopping for the right names Investors who are willing to do the due diligence for individual dividend-paying stocks will want to keep an eye on companies' balance sheet and free cash flow. They will also want to track the consistency of a company's earnings and get into the details of its dividend payout ratio. Indeed, a high dividend payout ratio suggests that a company is paying out more of its earnings toward shareholders, rather than reinvesting in the business. High dividend yields are also worth watching, as they may suggest that a company's share price is on a downward trajectory. For investors who'd rather take a diversified approach toward adding dividend payers, the S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) could be a good place to start. Household names including Emerson Electric , Clorox and Walmart are among its holdings.",2025-02-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/earnings-season-is-winding-down-and-these-sp-500-companies-have-hiked-their-dividends.html,cnbc
What's hot in ETFs? Bond funds are in demand as investors flee the Nasdaq 'QQQ',"The Sphere is seen during opening night with the U2:UV Achtung Baby Live concert at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas on Sept. 29, 2023.

About 2,000 asset managers and investment advisors are here at the Exchange ETF conference in Las Vegas.

A small ETF crowd arrived Saturday night to see Dead & Co. at the Sphere, who put on an amazing light show on top of an amazing music show. (What did you expect from the Dead?)

Musical entertainment aside, this is a gathering of asset managers like Blackrock and Vanguard along with investment advisors who buy the ETFs. The advisors want help in three areas: 1) understanding the recent market chaos, 2) investing strategies using ETFs, and 3) how to more efficiently grow and manage their business.

That third area, broadly known as ""practice management,"" is an Increasingly large part of the focus of these conferences: it will get roughly 35% of the content focus at this conference. That's because the wealth management business is growing fast, even as it focuses on a smaller group of wealthy investors who have profited from the growth of both real estate and the stock market.

ETF flows in 2025: Fixed income is strong

It's often said that ""flows follow price,"" that is, many investors are largely trend followers who buy what others are buying.

ETF flows year to date have been choppy. The main trend is inflows continue into equities, but there have been strong inflows into fixed income, particularly in ultrashort funds. Precious metal funds have seen surprisingly light inflows, given the recent highs in gold.

ETF inflows YTD

Equity $135 billion

Fixed income $92 b

Fixed income Ultrashort $40 b

Precious metals $8 b

Source: ETF Action

For equities, the biggest chunk of inflows (about half) remains into passive index funds, a trend that has been going on for many years. Until recently, there has been modest inflows into large cap growth funds like Vanguard Growth Index ETF (VUG). One warning sign for this category: outflows in the last 30 days in Invesco QQQ Trust , a sign some tech momentum investors are getting nervous.

More importantly: there are significant inflows into fixed income, almost on a level with equity inflows.

This makes sense on two levels: 1) the recent market volatility has driven some to the safe haven of bonds, and 2) the population is getting older.

""Investor demographics are another long-term driver of the shift towards bond funds, as investors in or approaching retirement de-risk their portfolios and place a premium on reliable sources of income,"" Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar told me.

Much of the recent bond flow has been going into ultrashort Treasuries, and evaluating those flows is a major focus for the conference.

""We think advisors are looking to make sense of the fixed income market and understand how to position client portfolios amid market volatility,"" Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at TMX Vettafi, which is running the conference, told me . There are several sessions focused on where asset managers like BondBloxx and F/m see the best opportunities in fixed income.

Private equity and private credit in ETF wrapper

Getting private credit and private equity into an ETF wrapper is proving tricky.

The recent launch of the SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) was met with only modest demand from investors, but interest in the space still remains high.

""There are a lot of industry discussions underway about the SSGA offering and what else might be coming from the industry,"" Rosenbluth said. Bondbloxx has previously launched a Private Credit CLO ETF (PCMM) that will be discussed on stage.

The takeaway is investors want access to private equity and private credit, but it's tough to provide in an ETF wrapper.

""There's an important liquidity mismatch,"" James Thomas from Ropes & Gray told a panel at the conference.

""Getting illiquid asset classes to work in an ETF wrapper can require watering down the stuff that investors want — in this case, exposure to private assets,"" Johnson at Morningstar told me.

""This is a category where there's already entrenched leadership and stiff competition in the semi-liquid space where specialist firms like Blackstone, Apollo, and Cliffwater have already made significant headway with non-traded BDCs and interval funds,"" Johnson said, referring to business development companies. ""These evergreen fund structures don't have to water down the 'good' stuff the way an ETF does and many of them are offered in a wrapper that's generally still convenient for most investors.""

Bottom line: it's still unclear if ETFs will be the dominant space for trading private capital products.

Actively managed ETFs

Actively managed ETFs represent less than 10% of the assets of the nearly $11 trillion ETF business in the United States, but they have been punching above their weight for some time. This year, nearly 30% of the total amount of new cash going into ETFs has swung to the active models.

Active ETF managers like Cohen and Steers (which recently introduced an actively managed real estate ETF), TCW and T. Rowe Price will be presenting their best active ideas.

One active trend worth mentioning: option income and buffer products.

Option income products are tapping a desire for funds that provide regular income. The largest ETF in this area, the JP Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), sells covered call options on the S&P 500. This caps some upside potential but also provides a monthly income.

Buffered products like the FT Vest Laddered Buffer ETF (BUFR) and the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) provide exposure to the S&P 500 up to a limit and provides a buffer against some losses. These products have proven very popular with investors who want to stay in the market but also opt for some downside protection.

Leverage/inverse, single-stock bets are hot

There is a small but substantial group that enjoy placing outsized bets on the market. Leveraged and inverse ETFs have grown substantially in the last few years, from roughly 2% of ETF assets under management to about 7%.

This group was previously hot on leveraged and inverse bets on indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100. Many have since shifted their attention to single stock ETFs that are bets on high volatility tech stocks like Tesla , Coinbase Global , Strategy , Nvidia and even Apple .

Leverage/inverse: single-stock bets are hot

(YTD flows)

Single stock leverage/inverse $6.5 billion

Indexed leverage/inverse $607 million

Source: ETF Action

Most of the holders of these ETFs hold them for only short periods of time (often a day or so), and with good reason: in downtrends the daily reset that is built into these products can produce results that are disastrous in a very short period of time.

Single stock ETFs in March

Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2x (TSLL) -33%

GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily (CONL) -28%

Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2x Shares (AAPU) -20%

GraniteShares 1.25x Long Tesla Daily ETF (TSL) -20%

ETF share classes of mutual funds

Vanguard pioneered this structure, which allows an ETF to be used as a share class within a mutual fund. The ETF structure is more tax efficient because it allows for better management of capital gains.

Now that the Vanguard patent has expired, roughly 50 other firms have filed to offer ETF share classes of their mutual funds and are awaiting SEC approval.

""This is going to happen fast,"" Joe Mannon from Vedder Price told a panel at the conference on Sunday. ""I could see the SEC going light speed on this.""

Ben Johnson at Morningstar agrees.

""I think that SEC approval is a matter of when and not if,"" he told me. ""Tacking ETF shares onto existing mutual funds has the potential to benefit all fund shareholders, and it is also a structure that's been successful for all involved in other markets outside the U.S., like Canada.""",2025-03-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/etf-conference-draws-2000-managers-and-advisors-to-air-latest-trends.html,cnbc
It's time to buy when markets reach 'peak uncertainty.' Are we there yet?,"Every investor knows, or should, that the moment of maximum uncertainty is a time to buy. The only trick, then, is discerning when we've reached peak uncertainty. The stifling lack of clarity about the breadth or severity of the Trump administration's promised ""reciprocal"" tariffs due on April 2 is the obvious eye of this uncertainty storm. But swirling around it are immigration restrictions, headlong and haphazard reductions in Federal spending and a separate but related confidence shock weighing on consumer behavior. Friday's midday rally in the S & P 500 from an early 1% decline to a minimal gain by the close came after President Trump said there would be some ""flexibility"" in the application of those April 2 trade measures. A vague and entirely reversible utterance, but the upward twitch in the index sends the message that after a month of volatile trading and universal fixation on policy risk, the potential for a relief trade is ample. .SPX 5D mountain S & P 500, 5 days Renaissance Macro Research has consistently pointed out that when the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index is near an extreme high (in the top 10% of all readings since 1985), forward equity performance is better than average. Over the ensuing three months, the S & P 500 has been up 80% of the time with an average gain of 8.8%. And perceived certainty is bearish: The lowest 10% of policy-uncertainty readings were followed by a positive stock market performance only 36% of the time. Currently, it hardly needs to be said, this index is at a record, eclipsing even the peak of the Covid panic. This Sunday is the fifth anniversary of that crescendo of fear in the market, marking the low of a violent V-bottom that launched stocks to a 100% gain over the next 22 months. No confidence in forecasts The suspense over the tariff details — and apprehension about how they will interact with the fragile confidence evident in recent surveys of consumers, business leaders and investors – has drained conviction from economic handicappers, including those who work at the Federal Reserve. After the meeting last week in which the Fed left interest rates unchanged and preserved a tentative outlook for a half-percentage-point worth of cuts the rest of this year, Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""I don't know anyone who has a lot of confidence in their forecast."" Here's a visual illustration of this collective shrug of the shoulders. JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli plotted the ""risk bias"" of FOMC members, or which direction they believe their inflation and GDP-growth forecasts are in jeopardy of being wrong. Nearly all say the risk on core PCE inflation is to the upside, and to the downside for real GDP growth. So there is no peace on either of the two fronts that define the Fed's mandate. Is this inherently negative for the economy and markets, though? Look at the last time those lines gapped apart to a similar degree. It was in late 2022, just as reported inflation was peaking, recession expectations were near-universal — and the S & P 500 bottomed after its nine-month, 25% bear market. Hindsight is unfailingly comforting in clarifying such market proclivities. What's tricky right now is not simply that perceived uncertainty can always go to more extreme extremes for a while. It's also that the market itself has not shown anything like the degree of panic or repriced fundamental expectations evident in the uncertainty gauges or experienced in early 2020 and late 2022. What we've had is a sharp little correction in the S & P 500 that kissed the 10%-loss threshold before bouncing a week ago Friday, having started from elevated valuations and ebullient investor expectations following consecutive 20% annual gains. When perceived uncertainty rages (yes, perceived; the world is inherently uncertain even when we're all sure of what comes next), it is helpful to anchor to what we know about the probabilities. Recession is what matters Warren Pies, founder of 3Fourteen Research, dissected the 52 S & P 500 corrections since 1950 (which works out to around one every year and a half or so.): ""Once the market falls into a correction, a 'serious correction' of at least 15% becomes a probability (30 out of 52 cases). However, within those 52 corrections, 28 occurred with no recession ahead in the next 12 months. Out of these cases, only 12 went on to become serious corrections."" Simplistic as it sounds, the odds of a decline something much deeper and more long-lasting hinges on whether the slowdown underway sags into an economic contraction. Of course, non-recession bear markets occur, we just had one in 2022, but we're talking probabilities here. This is why tariffs are more than simply a psychological overhang on the market, because at some level of severity and in certain escalation scenarios they are much more potentially damaging in undercutting economic activity than in mechanically resetting some prices higher. For now, the hesitant but still healthy corporate-credit market is doing a lot of the work in holding off a recessionary setup. Weekly unemployment claims remain at benign levels. Consumer activity has slowed and retail and travel stocks have taken lumps for it, but household balance sheets aren't badly stretched in aggregate. Industrial production was reported at a record high, something that has never immediately preceded an economic contraction. Even still, about 40% of all 10% setbacks in stocks slide at least to a 15% total decline even without a recession. And in any case, corrections and bottoms are a process not a moment. Ned Davis Research U.S. equity strategist Ed Clissold points out that after an initial rebound rally, there is typically a period of churn and retesting. ""The duration of the retesting phase can be roughly proportional to the original decline,"" he says. ""The Feb. 19 peak in the S & P 500 to the March 13 low was 16 trading days. Another 16 days would bring us to April 4, near President Trump's April 2 deadline for instituting reciprocal tariffs. Since tariff concerns were the main catalyst for the selloff, the April 2 deadline could bring a resolution, one way or the other."" Levels to watch I won't argue too strenuously against the assertion that tariff concerns are the proximate headline driver of the downside chop. Yet the heaviest pressure on the market has come from not from dealers in cross-border goods but the Magnificent Seven mega-cap growth group. The ""other 493"" stocks in the benchmark are up slightly on the year and less than 6% below their peak. A week ago here , in suggesting the snapback rally had plenty to prove after four losing weeks, I noted that five-week losing streaks were rare and this past Friday's triple-witching derivatives expiration looked to have a slight upside bias. Those notions held up, but barely. The S & P 500 was up half a percent on the week. It failed to hold above the 5,700 level on three separate days, finishing at 5,667, its precise mid-July high, coinciding with the peak in Mag7 dominance. It has reclaimed just a quarter of its peak-to-trough decline. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1 year The correction low from seven trading days ago still seems a plausible, if not fully persuasive, tactical pivot point. Sentiment readings got ""low enough"" to allow for a market turnabout, even if investor positioning never got profoundly washed out. The S & P 500 Volatility Index put in a nice spike, peaking near 30 and then declining below 20, often a sign the fever has broken. The S & P 500 shed two P/E points in three weeks, though the freshest results and muted outlooks from Nike and FedEx prompted negative stock responses and even now that forward P/E is above 20. And it's tough to see many catalysts for analysts to be lifting profit forecasts soon, especially given second-half estimates have held up as GDP forecasts have come down. Strategists at two Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital, have cut their year-end S & P 500 targets in recent weeks. That can sometimes be a sign that expectations are being reset in a constructive way, an acknowledgement of an intrinsically unsure future, which now seems even more unsettled thanks in part to a White House with a flair for ""event programming.""",2025-03-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/its-time-to-buy-when-markets-reach-peak-uncertainty-are-we-there-yet.html,cnbc
"Pioneering advisor conference comes to Miami Beach with volatility, crypto and AI as hot topics","MIAMI BEACH, FL. — It's the time of year when Miami Beach and other Florida towns are inundated with spring breakers out to have a good time. In the middle of these festivities descends the Future Proof Citywide conference, a gathering of 2,500 financial advisors, family office, and wealth management executives. Future Proof is part of an effort to ""dismantle the old boundaries"" and knit together three disparate communities: 1) the old Wall-Street community (the Merrill Lynch's, UBS, State Street, etc.) with 2) the growing community of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), and 3) the growing ""alt"" community of crypto, hedge funds, family offices and other investors in the ultra-high net worth community. This is the fifth Future Proof conference, and the first in Miami following conferences in Huntington Beach, Ca. ""The festival in California focuses on RIAs [Registered Investment Advisors], but this festival is broader, it focuses on the ecosystem of wealth and asset managers, including RIAs but also family offices and ultra-high net worth individuals,"" Matt Middleton, Founder and CEO of Future Proof, told me. It's mostly about networking Like the other Future Proof conferences, this one is on the beach. In this case, right in the heart of South Beach. As the conference began Sunday afternoon, Jeff Corey and Lincoln Hurney from Claro Advisors in Boston were taking refuge from the 85 degree heat, listening to a talk on private equity and credit. Corey said they were there for three reasons. ""First, we're here to talk to other financial advisors in similar situations, and to try to figure out how to get to the next level. Second, we want to hear more about technology and how to use AI responsibly, and finally we want to reconnect with friends we have met at prior Future Proofs, because we follow each other's careers and we can rely on my fellow advisors to give us an unbiased opinion on products and platforms and even career paths."" That desire to reconnect with other RIAs and investment professionals is the main reason many keep coming back. ""It's great to reconnect with colleagues,"" Alex Barned from Absolute Capital Management told me. Barned runs a turnkey asset management program (TAMP), which are platforms designed to help financial advisors manage investment accounts more efficiently. ""The biggest RIAs are all coming through here,"" he told me, ""We get to meet with the decision makers for those firms. We established two dozen new relationships at the last Future Proof. And being here elevates our profile with our clients and potential clients."" ""The networking is what makes this work,"" Doug Gill from Castleview Partners in Dallas told me. He too runs a TAMP that is hired by asset managers to run their accounts more efficiently. ""If I can meet one boutique asset manager who can use our platform, and one RIA that manages, say, $100 million, that will make the trip worthwhile."" It's not just networking and socializing Gill adds another reason he comes: ""The content is good."" Besides advice on how financial advisors can better grow and manage their business, there are panels on everything from succession planning to family office governance to generational wealth transfer. There's also plenty for advisors who want to take home actionable ideas for their clients. Bitcoin is top of mind for many. I'll be interviewing Strategy's Michael Saylor Monday morning, whose firm owns 500,000 bitcoin and has very strong opinions on the future of crypto. The recent market turmoil is also top of mind. I'll be speaking with Fundstrat's co-founder, Tom Lee, to get his take on where the markets are going next, also on Monday morning. My colleague Dom Chu will be getting the macroeconomic outlook Tuesday when he interviews Brian Belski from BMO Capital, Emily Roland from John Hancock Investment Management, and Gabriela Santos, Chief Market Strategist, Americas, for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. And CNBC regular Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities will give his broad overview of where the AI revolution is going during an interview on Tuesday. Bridging public and private markets is also a hot topic. I'll be speaking with Joe DeVico, co-head of U.S. Wealth Advisory for BlackRock, on Tuesday. Not evident in this MIami Beach incarnation are some of the whackier classes that made the California Future Proofs so endearing (""Fish Taco Frenzy: Coastal Cooking Class.""). ""The main theme that makes FutureProof special is the networking, and it's all done through technology,"" Middleton told me. ""We want people to catch up with current friends and clients, but more importantly we want to focus on expanding their network."" Much of this is being accomplished through a ""speed dating"" service that matches investment professionals with sell-side providers for short, 15-minute one-on-ones. At the last Future Proof in September, MIddleton said they arranged 32,000 meetings. That's more than enough to keep the old Wall Street sell-side community happy.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/pioneering-advisor-conference-comes-to-miami-beach-with-volatility-crypto-and-ai-as-hot-topics.html,cnbc
"After such a relentless market correction, the relief rally faces a high burden of proof","It felt better, but did it mean anything? Friday's zippy 2.1% bounce in the S & P 500 , at minimum, interrupted one of the more relentless retrenchments from a record high Wall Street had seen. The index took a mere three weeks and a day to fall just over 10% from its peak on Feb. 19 through Thursday's close, in its way an equal and opposite reaction to the imperturbable rally that had lifted the market to those highs. Without reciting the entire lab report on what has the market under the weather, like most corrections this one has a composite of causes. It starts with the pre-existing condition of a highly concentrated, expensive index riding elevated expectations for an ideal economic and policy backdrop into 2025. An initial infection (a winter soft patch in consumer spending and a rethink of the sustainability of the AI-buildout theme) led straight to some complications: Walmart's downbeat outlook on Feb. 20 worsened the ""growth scare"" while helping to kneecap the crowded momentum cohort of stocks, which included Walmart, Costco, Eli Lilly and JP Morgan, along with Nvidia, Meta Platforms and the like. Finally, the medication for the top-heavy market – rotation into value and overseas stocks – had the side effect of swamping the index due to the enormous size of stocks being sold versus those being bought. And, yes, the erratic declarations of escalating tariffs and haphazard cuts in government employment have generated a near-constant barrage of ""tape bombs"" to keep traders off balance. .SPX mountain 2025-02-19 S & P 500 since Feb. 19 A one-day relief bounce can't cure all that, but Friday's pop did at least check off a few initial boxes on the correction-comeback worksheet. The rise was overwhelmingly broad, the upside NYSE volume falling a whisper shy of 90%. At minimum, it broke an uncommonly persistent downtrend, with daily intraday losses that formed an unnervingly linear angle of descent. The S & P 500 hadn't closed above its five-day moving average – yes, five-day – in March, until it easily surpassed it on Friday. Constructive, but not decisive. It's mildly heartening to the bulls that the pop came on a day when a wretched University of Michigan consumer sentiment report fell shy of forecasts while showing a drop in confidence in the job market and another rise in inflation expectations. Resilience against an admittedly impressionistic and politically inflected survey is at least a decent hint that the recent sell-off already took account of the downturn in ""soft data"" and for the market to deepen the pullback by much from already oversold levels, it would take tangible evidence of a faltering economy. Consumer-discretionary stocks, on an equal-weighted basis, had spent weeks collapsing relative to defensive consumer staples, as seen here. A key indicator of the market's macro message, this relationship has round-tripped since Election Day and sits somewhere close to a make-or break level. Bank of America's consumer-stock trading desk shared a comment Friday from a client on the urgent downside reversal in cyclical stocks: ""We might be late innings in the positioning unwind, but we're early innings in the recession risk narrative. And thus, does the recession overhang/uncertainty keep mean reversion buyers on-hold?"" Of course, we get more growth scares than recessions, which is a slight comfort, perhaps. We'll get a fresh monthly retail-sales report next week, which will be a timely test of whether consumers are acting much more cautious or mostly just speaking that way to pollsters. A market low is a process The standard playbook for evaluating corrections and comebacks requires a recitation of the time-yellowed clichés: V-bottoms happen, but they are relatively rare. A market low is a process, not a moment. And short, sharp rallies are common but always have much to prove. At the S & P 500 closing print at 5,638, it had merely bounced to the high of the prior few days and sits below its mid-July peak. From here it needs to climb another 1.8% just to get back to its 200-day moving average. Larry McMillan of McMillan Analysis offers the reminder that snapback rallies in corrections often extend to a 20-day average before failing; that threshold is now 4% above where the index finished the week. One would also want to see if the market could rise on a day when the aggressive tariff threats are flying, as a further sign it is building calluses against the policy friction. Friday was a rare session when all was quiet on this front. Other modestly hopeful factors to toss onto the pile: Fast corrections such as this one are somewhat more likely to be short-lived setbacks worth buying. This drop was among the seven briefest 10% declines in history. Fundstrat Research says after all of the prior six, the market was higher three, six and 12 months later. The S & P has been down four straight weeks and it's pretty rare to lose over five in a row. Next week's options expiration is handicapped to exert an upward bias. And this is exactly the time of the year when seasonal forces start to turn more positive. Beyond the tactical X's and O's that inform the opportunistic gambits and systematic wagers of the short-term money, it's fair to observe that the market has undergone a tidy little reset in valuation and expectations. Lower valuation In a timely call, Truist Wealth chief market strategist Keith Lerner downgraded equities to neutral in late February just after the market peaked. Last Tuesday, he suggested a decent amount of risk had been bled from the market. He noted the S & P 500 dropped two P/E points, from 22-times forward profits to about 20, in rapid fashion. In recent years, that's around where the tape has tended to stabilize. He adds that the magnitude of the index drop roughly means ""the market is 'pricing in' about a 1 in 3 chance of recession versus almost nothing a few weeks ago."" I'll add that the mega-cap-growth Nasdaq 100 index, still 11% off its high, has fallen three forward-P/E turns to below 24, and is now at its ten-year average valuation premium to the S & P 500. The equal-weight S & P 500 is right at its 15-year P.E average near 16. None of this makes the market inexpensive or represents a wide margin of safety. And, of course, such ratios are only as good as the earnings forecasts, which are hanging in there but would appear to have more downside risk than upside. Yet if the urgent unwind in momentum strategies has abated (as many sell-side trading desks insist is likely), it's plausible to look for the mega-cap tier of the market to perhaps begin showing defensive characteristics against macro and policy flux, as it has in the past. None of this adds up to an emphatic case that the messy sell-[off has run its course. Payback for two straight 20% up years might not be complete. While sentiment has soured and some oversold conditions preceded Friday's rebound, key indicators had only begun to hint at a possible capitulative washout. And, of course, the speed and haphazard nature of the Trump administration's policy blitz – and officials' open willingness to accept or even invite economic pain in pursuit of their goals – are hard-to-handicap factors. I'll continue to argue that the downside leadership of the correction did not line up with what one would expect if it were ""all about tariffs."" But that doesn't mean that President Trump's war of choice against allies in pursuit of his version of trade parity in manufactured goods will not pressure the economy and the mindset of asset allocators indefinitely. Still, the market behavior to date – as dizzying and against-consensus has it's been – has not deviated enough from a typical setback in a post-election growth scare to insist that the rules for assessing this market's prospects have changed definitively with the leadership the White House.",2025-03-15 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/after-such-a-relentless-market-correction-the-relief-rally-faces-a-high-burden-of-proof-.html,cnbc
"Slowdown or recession? It's still not clear, and that's what's got the market on edge","The S & P 500 is now within roughly a half-percent of a 10% decline from its recent high. That would be a garden-variety correction, and it would be based on: 1) very rich valuations (the S & P 500 was trading at a multiple of 22 times 2025 estimates, historically high), and 2) a modest slowdown in the economy. That's what it feels like. It feels like a garden variety correction. The economy is slowing but still in decent shape. But the tariffs are making everyone crazy. I've been joking for a week that the tariff headlines are like having a bowling alley installed in your brain. Every day you're getting your head scrambled. Tipping agent The reason the market is in a tizzy is that the tariffs could be the agent that tips the economy from a modest slowdown into a recession. And for stocks, there's a big difference between a slowdown and a recession. In a slowdown, growth declines, but the economy doesn't shrink. In a recession, the economy shrinks. And the stock market reacts very differently to the two. Winners and losers in slowdowns and recessions In 2019, VisualCapitalist ran a study of economic cycles going back to 1960 based on data from SPDR Americas Research. It showed what you might expect: in a slowdown, defensive sectors like consumer staples and health care do well, but technology stocks can also do well. S & P 500: top sectors in a slowdown Consumer Staples +15% Health Care +15% Financials +14% Industrials +12% Utilities +12% Technology +10% But things are whole lot different in a recession. In a recession, almost nothing goes up. True, defensive sectors do not drop as much, but tech stocks tank. S & P 500: top sectors in a recession (since 1960; two quarters of falling GDP) Consumer Staples +1% Utilities -2% Health Care -3% Materials -12% Consumer Discretionary -12% Financials -12% Industrials -15% Technology -20% Real Estate -22% Are earnings at risk of significant cuts? Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines , lowered the earnings guidance for his company due to uncertainty in the economy. He's one of the first CEOs to specifically cite uncertainty as an issue. That could open the floodgates for analysts to begin lowering earnings estimates in other sectors. That's not good. Earnings estimates for 2025 have been remarkably stable, within a dollar or so of $270 for the S & P 500 since January. Overall, earnings are expected grow by 11% this year. S & P 500: Q1 earnings 2025 Q1: $60.39 Q2: $66.02 Q3: $70.64 Q4: $73.35 2025: $270.56 Source: LSEG Notice all the gains for this year are loaded toward the back end of the year, which is not unusual. But the first quarter number ($60.39) has been coming down (it was $62.78 at the beginning of January), and those numbers for the first and second quarter could start coming down fast if analysts take their cues from what the Delta CEO was saying. This creates two moves: one where the market moves in anticipation of a slower economy ... then potentially another leg down when analysts actually begin cutting estimates. Savita Subramanian at BofA Securities estimated last week that full implementation of the tariffs under discussion last week (25% import tariffs on Canada/Mexico, an additional 10% on top of February's 10% for China and a reinstatement of steel and aluminum tariffs of 25%) could drop S & P 500 estimates by 10%. That would practically wipe out any projected gains for the year. This is why it is really difficult to call bottoms in economic slowdowns. One thing is clear: what markets want is for the tariffs to go away, on the belief this could be the difference between a modest slowdown and a recession.",2025-03-12 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/slowdown-or-recession-lack-of-clarity-is-whats-got-the-market-on-edge.html,cnbc
When will selling stop? Market's fear gauge hits levels that have marked past short-term bottoms,"Short-term tradable bottom? The CBOE Volatility Index has spiked to 29, but more importantly, the VIX curve (the prices of near-term VIX options) is now in backwardation : that is, the prices of near-term contracts (cash and the March options contract) are now higher than options contracts further out (April, May, June). This is unusual and indicates very high levels of short-term fear. In the past, this has been associated with at least a short-term tradable bottom. @VX.1 3M mountain March VIX index contract over the past three months. I say ""short-term tradable"" because the market fears have now morphed beyond tariffs to include a wider economic slowdown. When these concerns surface, it is very difficult to ""call the bottom."" All we can say is that the market moves ahead of any slowdown. In a true economic downturn, there are usually additional legs down in the future as analysts adjust their earnings estimates lower in response to CEO commentary. Whether this is a ""true"" economic downturn, or the depth of the downturn, is still not clear.",2025-03-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/markets-fear-gauge-hits-levels-that-have-marked-past-short-term-bottoms.html,cnbc
Handicapping the next move for a stressed bull market,"The market's message and intentions are always worth debating — especially so during an intense pullback, with cacophonous policy headlines and piqued investor emotions animating the action day to day. Here's an assessment of the weight of the evidence, after another rough week — but one that ended in a perky, if apprehensive, rally off a six-month low Friday afternoon, leaving the S & P 500 more than 6% from its record high reached less than three weeks ago — in the form of a bull-bear debate. The bear case: This tape is guilty until proven innocent. The Nasdaq ended one of its longer streaks above its 200-day average in recent memory, and history says to expect more near-term downside for a while at least. The S & P 500 just broke its December low during the first quarter, a classic warning sign from the Stock Trader's Almanac, which suggests a high chance of significant further weakness before an ultimate low (and likely strong finish to the year) is reached. In fact, the index briefly even cracked its low from the entire fourth quarter, a rare gut check. Yes, the S & P 500 chopped around the 5700 for most of the week and held it with the late-Friday levitation. But does the market typically give traders four straight days to buy a durable low? The market could easily continue this tentative bounce here for any reason (or none at all), but the upside is capped well below the record highs. A slight majority of 5%+ pullbacks end before getting to a full 10% correction. Since 2022, though, it's been more like a coin toss, according to 3Fourteen Research, which notes here that the best dip-buying backdrop was 2009-2021, when economic-growth scares meant falling bond yields and a lack of inflation meant the Federal Reserve's safety net was never far below the market. Whatever the ultimate makeup of trade and immigration policies, they are at least initially more a source of economic friction than fuel, and a drag on growth. The Treasury market, with two-year yields down from 4.35% to 4% in a few weeks, is on high alert for a slowdown, just as Trump administration officials express an apparent acceptance of a potential ""detox"" economic slump front-loaded into the first year of its term. Granted, the retail-investor surveys are reflecting a panicky response to chaotic policy headlines, making it hazardous to get incrementally bearish from here. But we haven't seen the kind of headlong fund outflows or aggressive short-selling activity that would suggest the bears are overplaying their hand and that the low is in. Wall Street strategists haven't yet cut year-end index targets and while sell-side economists are trimming GDP estimates, recession calls haven't begun. Sure, the tech giants have come well off the boil and the Nasdaq 100 held tough at the 20,000 level and there's a scenario in which mega-cap tech starts to act as defensive leadership again at some point. But the Nasdaq 100's valuation has barely retreated as is far above pre-pandemic norms. And for investors who have an itch to play a cyclical acceleration, the rest of the world can now scratch it. Germany's move to lift government borrowing restraints and invest heavily in infrastructure and defense was an historic release of previously untapped fiscal power and growth sentiment. The German 10-year government bond yield rocketed from 2.66% to 3.09 on the week, the Euro soaring from $1.05 to above $1.08, the German DAX up 15% year to date. This as China also stimulates and its stock market roars back. If this is all about a rebalancing of consumption patterns and fiscal relationships across the globe after many years of overreliance on U.S. consumption, it's a positive. But big, rapid moves in currencies and global bond yields can be destabilizing and raise risk premiums. The early August 2024 ""yen carry trade"" panic is a recent example, which came after a two-week U.S. equity market setback that looks quite a bit like the current one. The bull case: The market has had a proper reset The S & P fell more than 7% from high to low over 12 trading days, taking it back to the mid-July high —almost to the tick — before bouncing a full 1.8% from the midday Friday low into the weekend. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1-year Yes, the index pierced below its 200-day moving average, but that trend line continues to slope solidly higher. The tape became oversold enough into the end of the week to make a pretty good bounce plausible, relieving some immediate pressure, and all things considered it's remained rather orderly. Investor attitudes have grown starkly worried, according to surveys of retail and professional investors. The Fear & Greed Index , a composite of several market-based indicators rather than opinions, by Thursday was pressing toward anxious extremes, a pretty good contrarian setup. A decent case can be made that the noisy sell-off into the middle of last week represented a moment of peak tariff aggression just as the slow-moving economic growth scare of recent weeks burst into the open for all to observe and fret over. The S & P 500 has spent the past four days testing the 5700 level repeatedly, and — so far — has absorbed the pressure, the bulls showing some fight even into another potentially noisy news weekend. Those charts that show blowout readings of the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index and tally up mentions of ""tariffs"" on corporate conference calls have been ubiquitous in recent weeks. One can't argue against the sense of mass indecision given the lack of policy-message clarity. Yet historically, such high levels of perceived uncertainty coincide with better buying than selling opportunities for stocks. Let's not forget, too, that along with the fitful on-off tariff news and a stutter-step in consumer spending, the recent market seizure was triggered by a nasty turnabout in once-crowded momentum stocks across every sector. While the market surely traded twitch-by-twitch with headlines about the less-than-coherent plan for tariffs last week, the stocks that exerted the most downside pressure on the S & P 500, were former momentum leaders Nvidia , Amazon , Meta , Tesla and JPMorgan . The momentum cohort has now had a true correction and JP Morgan quantitative strategists argued Friday that funds' exposures to this group have come back from historic extremes toward the more normal range. This style is not necessarily washed out yet but should present less risk of erratic liquidation looking ahead. Admittedly, the year started with the consensus brimming with high expectations, with valuations at post-pandemic highs and retail investors on a raging risk bender. But the market has largely taken care of this, puncturing all of the most popular premises entering 2025: U.S. exceptionalism, bearishness on bonds and a belief that the market could broaden in a smooth and painless way. Stocks have traded terribly off a pretty good earnings season, in part because corporate guidance has been uninspiring and current-quarter consensus S & P 500 profit growth has dropped from 11.6% to 7.3%, according to FactSet. Yet assuming the forecast settles near 7% and penciling in a typical margin or estimate-beating by companies, that's supportive growth. Consumer incomes in aggregate continue to grow, February job growth was passable and a slow start to retail sales this winter means a bigger spending cushion in coming months. Sure, the drop in Treasury yields speaks to slowdown fears, but they also support rate-sensitive parts of the economy such as housing. Who knows if a good trading bottom is in. And any bounce will initially be suspect given all the congestion looming above on the charts. But when prices sink and valuations fall, stocks become less risky for a long-term owner, not more. The median S & P 500 stock is 15% from its high. The equal-weighted S & P 500 is back to its 10-year average forward P/E ratio. Quality stocks have slackened even as speculative ones have buckled. Alphabet is now trading at its largest-ever discount to the broader market. A choppy start to a post-election year was to be expected, pullbacks are perfectly normal, and it remains a bull market until proven otherwise. Doesn't it?",2025-03-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/08/handicapping-the-next-move-for-a-stressed-bull-market.html,cnbc
Active managers keep lagging market: Why it's so tough to beat the indexes,"S & P Dow Jones Indices is out with its annual survey of the performance of active fund managers, and once again the performance is dismal. Sixty-five percent of large-cap fund managers underperformed their benchmark (the S & P 500) in 2024. The long-term performance is even worse: 84% underperformed after 10 years. The SPIVA U.S. Scorecard , run by S & P Dow Jones Indices, is the gold standard for evaluating the performance of active fund managers against their benchmarks. The 2024 report includes more than 2,000 mutual funds and ETFs in the U.S., substantially all the domestic funds in the U.S. 2024 in line with historic averages, but small cap did better Last year's large-cap fund tally was slightly worse than the 24-year average of 64% of funds underperforming. Mid-cap managers did not fare any better although ,surprisingly, small-cap managers had a better performance: only 30% underperformed their benchmarks, far below the historic average of 60% underperforming. Fund manager underperformance in 2024 Large-cap managers: 65% Mid-cap managers: 62% Small-cap: 30% Source: SPIVA Why did small cap managers do relatively well last year? The S & P 600 small-cap index returned less than 7% last year, ""and there was a huge return differential (16%) between the large cap S & P 500 and the small cap S & P 600,"" Anu Ganti, head of U.S. Index Investment Strategy for S & P Dow Jones Indices and the author of the report, told CNBC. ""That may have helped active small cap managers because they may have been able to take on exposure to larger cap stocks."" Active managers long-term track record terrible Over the 24-year history of the SPIVA survey, one striking feature stands out: not only do the majority of fund managers underperform each year, but the underperformance rates go up as the time horizon lengthens. As bad as it is, the underperformance only gets worse still after 10 years. Large-cap fund managers underperformance (vs. S & P 500) After 1-year: 65.2% After 5-years: 76.2% After 10-years: 84.3% After 20-years: 92.0% Source: SPIVA ""These numbers have not changed much over the years, showing how difficult it is to outperform long-term,"" Ganti told me. Surveying the results, the 2019 SPIVA study concluded, ""[T]he persistence of fund performance was worse than would be expected from luck."" An important point about the SPIVA study: it accounts for both fees and survivorship bias. Many funds liquidate or merge over time. Over a 10-year period, about one-third of funds go out of business, largely due to poor performance, but the SPIVA report accounts for those funds. Long-term, it's really hard to beat the market Beating the stock market is a very difficult game. Stock pickers tend to do better during periods when: 1) there is high volatility, 2) markets are trending down, and 3) megacaps are underperforming. With the exception of a few moments, none of those conditions prevailed in 2024: volatility was relatively low, the S & P 500 returned another strong year (total return of 25%) and there was a generally strong performance from a small group of large-cap tech stocks. It's particularly tough for active managers when a small group of stocks push the indexes up all year, as again happened for most of last year. Why? When a small group of stocks lead, active managers would have to pick those exact few stocks that outperformed — and have an even higher concentration in them to outperform. But it is almost impossible to consistently pick those few winners and, at any rate, active managers are usually reluctant to take such concentrated bets. Active management outperformance is getting harder Active managers do not underperform because they are dumb. Just the opposite, Ganti tells me: the quality of active managers has never been higher. ""Everyone is getting too smart,"" Ganti told me. Ganti identified three consistent problems active managers encounter: 1) Active managers' fees are higher than index fund fees; 2) The market is composed of professional traders who do not have an information advantage; and 3) Only a minority of stocks typically outperform in any given year, and it is almost impossible to select what stocks will outperform ahead of time. ""It boils down to the increasing professionalization of the industry, the higher costs, and the fact that there is only a handful of stocks that drive outperformance, and it's like finding a needle in a haystack to identify them,"" Ganti said. Outperformers don't last If 90% of active managers underperform the market over time, why not just take the 10% that do outperform? Answer: the 10% who do outperform don't last long either. ""The top fund managers who do outperform over short periods do not do so for very long,"" Ganti said. ""A fund manager that outperforms over, say, a five-year period is unlikely to be the same fund manager that outperforms in the next five years."" There is also a very big difference between luck and skill. The data shows that a good part of the reason that 10% outperform is luck, and that is very different from skill.

"Markets starting to price in lower earnings estimates from tariffs, uncertain growth","The complacency around tariffs is dissipating. The stock market is starting to price in lower earnings, partly due to the impact of tariffs. While the Trump administration has argued against this, the market believes tariffs mean higher inflation and lower growth. After Trump's election, the stock market initially rallied on Trump's promise of less regulation and a pledge to cut corporate taxes from to 15% from 21%. Investors and analysts chose to ignore tariffs because it was widely believed Trump would not implement them. Earnings disconnect This created a disconnect between stock prices and earnings: stock prices had been rising, however earnings estimates ""have not been improving as it had initially [been] anticipated would occur under Trump,"" Nick Raich at Earnings Scout told CNBC. Earnings estimates have not been rising as fast as anticipated because analysts have not been getting clear signals from corporate America. Now, the belief that Trump would not implement tariffs has dissipated, and that may open the floodgates for lower earnings estimates. ""The market may have believed Trump is bluffing, but if global leaders come to believe he is bluffing, this could ignite a global trade war,"" Raich said. Analysts cutting earnings more than usual It's not just tariffs, Marc Chandler from Bannockburn Forex told CNBC. ""There is a stew of headline risk out there, everything from tariffs to a growth slowdown to inflation, DOGE, and budget issues,"" he told CNBC. ""This is not just about tariffs, this is about a different world view."" It's still early, but this ""stew"" of headline risk is starting to find its way into earnings estimates. It's typical for analysts to reduce earnings estimate in the first part of the quarter. They do this because analysts are historically bullish and typically adjust their estimates downward as they realize they have been too optimistic. But the numbers are coming down faster than usual. According to John Butters at Factset, first quarter earnings for the S & P 500 decreased by 3.5 percentage points from December 31 to February 27. That is a larger decrease than the 5-year average (2.6%), the 10-year average (2.6%), the 15-year average (2.4%), and the 20-year average (3.1%). These are not huge cuts, but the recent price action in the stock market indicates investors are nervous these cuts may get much larger. At LSEG, which uses a similar database, all 11 S & P 500 sectors have seen declines in estimates this quarter, but there has been a significant decline in estimates in cyclical sectors such as consumer discretionary and industrial stocks — those tied closely to the state of the economy. First quarter earnings estimates: declining faster than usual Consumer Discretionary Jan. 1: up 10.9% Feb. 28: up 1.1% Industrials Jan. 1: up 12.3% Feb. 28: up 5.6% Materials Jan.1: up 10.2% Feb. 28: down 5.9% Source: LSEG Some companies are already making specific warnings on tariffs. Target and Best Buy this week both warned that tariffs will drive prices higher for the consumer. What side of the Trump bet are you on? Ultimately, this all boils down to what side of the Trump bet you are on. Are you on the side that believes global leaders are going to call his bluff and cause a trade war, or are you on the side that believes Trump will negotiate his way out of a trade war and leave very little damage behind? Opinions are split. ""The bottom line is the market does not like taking Trump at face value, because he is too mercurial,"" Alec Young at MAPsignals.com told me . ""I don't think Trump wants to crash the global economy."" Marc Chandler is also in that camp: ""Most people still believe there will be a deal that will be worked out,"" he said. Others are less sure. ""Trump is predictably unpredictable,"" Raich told me, acknowledging that many still believe he will be able to negotiate some kind of deal that would enable him to back off on tariffs. ""This is a dangerous game of chicken, and the market has not fully priced this in."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in an interview on Fox Business, hinted President Trump may propose a compromise: ""You do more and I'll meet you in the middle some way,"" he said. Others may not have a strong opinion one way or the other, but are astonished at the level of day-to-day headline risk. ""I leave my desk, and I come back and say, 'What just happened?,'"" Jay Woods from Freedom Capital Markets told CNBC. ""Trump doesn't give us a break.""",2025-03-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/markets-start-pricing-in-weaker-earnings-from-tariffs-uncertain-growth.html,cnbc
Stock market enters March facing economic jitters and intense policy noise that's denting confidence,"It probably has felt worse than it looks. A not-quite-5% shakeout from a record high in the S & P 500 is purely routine in magnitude and in some respects came right on time. It was never a secret that late February can be a rough patch for stocks. And the fine print on all the bullish writeups for 2025 dutifully noted that post-election years often withhold their rewards in the early going and that equity returns after consecutive annual gains of 20% or more tend to moderate. Here's a picture from Strategas Research of the S & P 500 since Election Day 2024, against the average performance after elections since Dwight Eisenhower was first voted into the White House. Even the sharp turn in market leadership toward ""safer"" sectors in recent weeks maps tightly to the historical record, as this Ned Davis Research study of the relative performance of defensives (staples, healthcare, utilities and telecom) makes clear. Yet as much as the late-February flop scans as perfectly normal on paper, the manner and speed of the setback, the way it challenges some core consensus assumptions and the cacophonous policy-news soundscape have arguably made the action more unsettling. Money has rushed from the crowded and popular areas (tech, industrials) to the spurned and disliked (staples, healthcare). Foreign stocks have outpaced the U.S., confounding a collective ""U.S. exceptionalism"" trade. Bonds have rallied in the face of the ""higher-for-longer"" crowd. The key indexes fell through a trap door right from the latest all-time high set on Feb. 19, at least until the final minutes of Friday's session, when a huge cluster of buy orders set for the month-end close met a shaken and mildly oversold tape to drive a quick 1.5% levitation in the S & P 500. (A mechanical rebalancing effect like this qualifies as buying all the same, and the prices still count on the big scoreboard. The quicksilver closing rally hit just as the Nasdaq 100 was encountering important trend support, too. Yet it would be surprising if the market didn't feel the need to test the territory covered in those final moments for the presence of new high-conviction buyers.) What's causing the selling? As is usually the case when a bull market falters a bit, there are multiple likely suspects acting at once. We entered the year riding elevated valuations and high expectations for an ideal setup of above-trend economic performance that would draw further strength from loosening Federal Reserve policy and a purported ""growth-friendly"" administration. All this, just as earnings growth would broaden out and allow the majority of stocks to catch up. Meantime, retail investors were pumping adrenaline into a new category of moonshot tech themes, crypto plays and Trump-adjacent meme names. None of this has been decisively refuted or permanently canceled, but the plot lines have run into complications. There is a mild but meaningful economic growth scare underway. The Citi U.S. Economic Surprise Index has rolled over into the negative zone (meaning macro data is on average falling short of forecasts). The consumer seems to have stepped back at the start of the year. While the drop in Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracking for the first quarter into negative territory on Friday is mostly about pulled-forward imports and inventories (factors likely to reverse), the Treasury market surely is registering a deceleration. The two-year Treasury yield sank back below 4% for the first time in several months, beckoning the Fed to prioritize growth risks over steady inflation. This all has prevented the core cyclical parts of the market from fully supporting the indexes on days when the dominant mega-cap Nasdaq leaders have sagged. The pervasive calls for a ""broadening market"" have in some respects been met; the Magnificent 7 as a group is down almost 6% year to date with the rest of the index up a few percent. Yet a bare majority of S & P 500 stocks are in an uptrend and key macro bellwethers such as small-caps and industrials are back below Election Day levels. Bank stocks and credit spreads are so far holding up reasonably well, though have not been immune. John Kolovos, chief technical market strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, says, ""Financials, the last main holdout within cyclicals and tied to credit conditions, remain strong, while staples is overbought within a downtrend, and Industrials are oversold within an uptrend. We 'should,' therefore, see risk sentiment begin to improve if a) equities are not to fall into a correction or worse, b) a policy mistake results in worsening credit conditions, and 3) the shroud of uncertainty from DC doesn't cripple the economy."" Earnings as reported have hit all the usual marks, three-quarters of companies beating estimates. The decline in full-year S & P 500 profit consensus so far this year has been 1%, a pretty normal pace of moderation, according to FactSet. Yet shares of both companies beating and missing expectations are being treated less generously than usual. And Bespoke Investment Group notes that the percentage of companies raising guidance is the lowest since Covid and is half the percentage of those cutting their outlook. Investors losing confidence? This all speaks to a general lack of conviction in the pacing and extent of policy moves spanning tariffs, immigration restrictions, sudden Federal agency cutbacks and geopolitical reorientation. I usually discount the ""confidence"" and ""uncertainty"" factors as direct market drivers. The world is inherently uncertain at all times, and when people perceive it as such it means this reality is being recognized and the market is in the prices of pricing it in. Yet at a time like this, when ""rising animal spirits"" was a top-three bullish talking point entering the year, the psychology can't fully be dismissed. The intense policy noise, like someone turning the dial of an old car radio through all the stations constantly, has dampened some ordinary investors' mood to an historic degree. This look from BTIG shows net bulls in the American Association of Individual Investors survey falling toward deep bear-market readings even with the S & P 500 just off a record. Odd and hard to interpret, given that it doesn't fit perfectly with real-money sentiment gauges. Options activity, ETF flows have reflected a more upbeat view, though with some cooling off. Deutsche Bank's composite investor positioning measure fell hard to the dead-neutral zone at week's end, a constructive though not decisive development. Four weeks ago, I noted here that clockwork sector rotation and ferocious retail-investor bid were the two forces propping up the tape. The gears of the rotation, as noted, have been slipping somewhat. On the retail enthusiasm, I suggested, ""be watchful of excesses developing and be aware that this crowd can exhaust itself buying dips in the same old favorites. Is something like this happening in Nvidia? The Street flow trackers have noted that small traders have been persistent bidders for Nvidia shares and options on each break, even as fund managers have gradually lightened up in the stock."" Nvidia rallied a quick 10% from there and then gave it all up and a bit more despite healthy, if not dazzling, quarterly results. The more overheated retail playthings have had it worse as traders both prompted and reacted to the sharp reversal in momentum leaders. The bellwether pair I've tracked, Robinhood and Palantir, like Nvidia ripped into mid-February and have since broken hard, the former 25% off its high and the latter down 33%. An index from Goldman Sachs of ""high retail sentiment"" stocks gave up in eight trading sessions the 20% gain it had built up over the prior three months. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1-year MRA's Kolovos has been holding to an upside S & P 500 target of 6600, but more loosely and with a tighter focus on the interim hazards of a breakdown in the market's once-elegant rotational dynamics. After last week, he saw ""further evidence of an equity tape that is not only stuck in purgatory but one that may still need to shake hands with the devil at the 200-day moving average before ascending."" That level is just 2% beneath Friday's low and 3.9% below where it closed. Market shakeouts are about testing risk tolerances, forcing a rethink of unexamined premises and, at times, chastening the arrogant. A good deal of this work has been underway for a few weeks, taking the benchmark S & P 500 back to a spot first reached more than four months ago, which is sometimes enough of a reset, but not always.",2025-03-03 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/03/stock-market-enters-march-facing-economic-jitters-and-intense-policy-noise-thats-denting-confidence.html,cnbc
An entire trading ecosystem built around Nvidia alone is poised for a test again,"Nvidia reports earnings after the market closes Wednesday. With the possible exception of Tesla , no other stock generates the kind of short-term trading interest Nvidia does. There's an entire trading ecosystem built around Nvidia now. It is, for example, one of the most actively traded single-stock options in the market. Aside from significant options activity, a large trading ecosystem has also developed around Nvidia in the world of exchange-trade funds. ETFs own more than four billion shares of Nvidia, about 17% of the 24.49 billion total shares outstanding, according to Factset. Not surprisingly, broad market ETFs are the largest holders of Nvidia. Largest ETF holders of Nvidia (shares held, as of 1/31/25) Vanguard Total Stock Market ( VTI ) 731 million Vanguard S & P 500 ( VOO ) 675 m SPDR S & P 500 ( SPY ) 300 m iShares Core S & P 500 ( IVV ) 287 m Vanguard Growth Index ( VUG ) 235 m Source: ETF Action However, holders of these funds are mostly passive investors. Tech ETFs are massive holders of Nvidia Beyond these broad funds, there are very large holdings of Nvidia in technology ETFs and especially semiconductor ETFs. Other large ETF holders of Nvidia (shares held, as of 1/31/25) Vanguard Information Technology ( VGT ) 116 million Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK ) 73.5 m VanEck Semicondutor ( SMH ) 33 m Shares U.S. Technology ETF ( IYW ) 21.6 m iShares Semiconductor ETF ( SOXX ) 7.7 m Source: ETF Action While the dollar value of the holdings are smaller than in the broader ETFs above, the concentration is much higher. For example, the VanEck Semicondutor ETF has roughly 19% of its $23 billion market capitalization in Nvidia. More importantly, these tech ETFs, and particularly thematic tech ETFs like the semiconductor ETFs, are only partially held as passive investments. A very large part of these are now employed on a tactical level: these are traded on a daily basis. As a result, ETFs like the Van Eck Semiconductor often see heavier volume and volatility on days around Nvidia's earnings. A leader in single-stock leveraged/inverse ETFs Finally, in the last year there is enormous daily trading in leveraged and inverse Nvidia ETFs. Aside from a few Tesla and Microstrategy leveraged/long ETFs, Nvidia leveraged/long ETFs dominate this end of the market. Nvidia leveraged/inverse ETFs (by market capitalization) Graniteshares 2x Long NVDA Daily ( NVDL ) $3.7 billion Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ( NVDU ) $482 million GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF ( NVD ) $106 m Direxion Daily NVDA Bear 1x ( NVDD ) $39 m Two things to note: 1) While the total amount of money is relatively small, these are routinely among the most actively-traded ETFs by dollar volume (in other words, there is massive turnover in the funds every day), and 2) The amount of money in the bullish (long) ETFs is far greater than the amount of money in the bear bets. That's because Nvidia has generally been on an upswing: in the two years from 2023 to 2024, it was up about 800%, so huge numbers of traders are sitting on enormous potential profits, and active traders like these are momentum traders. This raises the possibility that these leveraged/inverse ETFs are a decent gauge of investor sentiment. This year, there has been outflows from the long ETF ( NVDL ), and inflows into both short ETFs (NVD and NVDS). What's it mean? It's a sign that, after years of bullish sentiment, there are some skeptics emerging in the Nvidia camp.",2025-02-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/entire-trading-ecosystem-built-around-nvidia-poised-to-be-tested-again.html,cnbc
"Ron Insana: Market risks are rising, and it might be time to sell the rallies","Legendary investor Warren Buffett is sitting on a record $334 billion in cash , but he hasn't said why his cash position is so large. Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen recently said that the Trump administration's tariffs and large-scale budget cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency could be bad for the economy and stock market. When the best investor and one of the top traders in the world both appear cautious, maybe it's time to pay attention. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett has not offered any explicit reason for Berkshire Hathaway 's record cash hoard. But you don't have to be storied financier Bernard Baruch to figure out that stashing cash is not the most bullish of signs. Warning signs The bear case has been made for some time now, as investors who previously urged caution pointed to a number of warning signs that are flashing in the market: Lofty valuations Deteriorating market breadth Highly concentrated returns in just a handful of mega-cap stocks Irrational exuberance over the promise of artificial intelligence Uncertainty over monetary and fiscal policies Worries about trade relations and geopolitical risk Looming issues around government funding Continued increases in federal deficits and the national debt It's a common saying that the stock market climbs a ""wall of worry"" and that overt pessimism is a contrary indicator. But aside from Buffett and Cohen, individual investors and self-directed traders have been pouring money into equities at a relatively brisk pace of late. This suggests that the public is still quite bullish on the prospects for U.S. stocks. Prudent pruning and diversification As I wrote in December, taking some chips off the table would not be unwise. Pruning one's portfolio, especially after two years of sizable gains, is a prudent thing to do. I also suggested earlier this year that tactical traders might want to swap some U.S. indexes for their European counterparts. Despite concerns about the European Union's economy, its relationship with the U.S. and the ongoing geopolitical risks related to Ukraine, European markets continue to outperform the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite . Indeed, the Stoxx Europe 600 index is up nearly 9% in 2025, while the S & P 500 has an advance of more than 2%. .STOXX .SPX YTD line The Stoxx Europe 600 vs. the S & P 500 in 2025 Domestic political concerns may also soon have an impact on U.S. financial markets. A few House Republicans have been getting an earful from constituents concerned about Elon Musk's attempted overhaul of various federal agencies, NBC News reported . There are economic risks to mass firings and furloughs. Assuming there is a limit to the buyouts offered to a swath of federal employees, jobless claims could jump. The overall employment situation could make it appear the U.S. economy is tilting toward recession while consumers are also increasingly worried about inflation. A stagflation scenario – that is, a combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth –is most certainly not priced into markets even though the possibility has been raised by some economists. In short, it may be a time for caution when it comes to buying the dip as investors have been taught to do. Rather than buying the dip, it might simply be time to sell the rallies. — CNBC contributor Ron Insana is CEO of iFi.AI, an artificial intelligence fintech firm.",2025-02-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/ron-insana-market-risks-are-rising-and-it-might-be-time-to-sell-the-rallies.html,cnbc
ETFs that allow investors to make big bets on market moves are gaining in popularity,"Traders work on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) floor on Feb. 20, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty Images

Spend some time looking at trading volumes, and you'll notice something interesting: A lot of investors recently are making outsized bets on the stock market. Most of them are long bets, but some are short. It's easy to see this because there is a growing segment of the ETF business that caters to investors who want to make short-term outsized bets on the stock market. These are leveraged and inverse ETFs. Leveraged ETFs amplify the daily returns of an index or stock using financial derivatives. For example, if an index rose by 1% in a day, a 2x leveraged ETF would deliver a 2% return, a 3x would deliver a 3% return. An inverse ETF delivers the opposite daily performance. So a 2x inverse ETF would be down 2% on a day when the index rose 1%, and vice-versa. These leveraged/inverse ETFs are not just growing in assets. They are becoming a greater part of the daily trading volume of the ETF universe, which is becoming a larger part of overall trading. Who is using these products? It has a lot to do with the general rise in speculative behavior in the market. Trading in options, bitcoin, and other more speculative products has been rising. ""We're continuing to see more investors lean into leveraged as a way to express short-term views on the market, and given all the volatility and daily market-moving headlines, it's not surprising we are seeing higher volume and more assets entering the space,"" Douglas Yones, CEO of Direxion, one of the largest providers of leveraged/inverse ETFs, told CNBC.

Growing as a share of assets

The first leveraged/inverse ETFs in the U.S. started in 2006 and allowed long or short bets on indexes like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100. Leverage and inverse single-stock ETFs came into existence in 2022, and they too have grown fast. The largest, ProSharesUltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), which provides 3x leveraged exposure to the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), has nearly $26 billion in assets. Single-stock ETFs that leverage Nvidia and Tesla also now have substantial assets. Largest leveraged/inverse ETFs (assets under management) ProSharesUltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) $25.7 billion Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x (SOXL) $8.5 billion ProShares Ultra QQQ (QLD) $7.9 billion ProShares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO) $5.5 billion Direxion Daily S&P Bull 3x (SPXL) $5.0 billion Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2x (TSLL) $3.5 billion GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA (NVDL) $4.2 billion

watch now

Part of this is a bull market effect: Stocks are up meaningfully in the last few years, so overall assets are higher. However, these leveraged/inverse ETFs are not just growing assets, they are becoming a larger part of the ETF universe. In 2016, when ETFs had about $2 trillion in assets under management (AUM), leveraged/inverse ETFs were about 2% of that AUM, according to Strategas. Today, ETFs have about $11 trillion in assets under management, but leveraged/inverse ETFs make up about $81 billion of that, or almost 8% of total AUM.

Why are these products growing?

""I do believe there is a generational effect at play, I think there is major appetite among younger traders wanting to play with leverage due to the gains it can provide,"" Todd Sohn, head of ETFs at Strategas, told CNBC. ""The barriers to entry are extremely low, you can buy these products on your phone."" Yones estimated that 75% of the ownership of these products were retail traders, and 25% institutional, which included hedge funds, trade desks, large brokerage firms, and ""anyone who has a book of positions that wants to be neutral the market."" He estimated that a small but significant percentage of the retail traders (12%-15% of the total) were from outside the U.S., which aligns with previous reports about growing demand for 24-hour trading coming in part from retail traders in South Korea, Japan, and Europe.

Growing part of daily trading volume

Leverage and inverse ETFs, including leveraged and inverse single-stock ETFs, now routinely show up among the most heavily traded ETFs on a daily basis. A simple way to look at this is by average daily dollar volume, the total amount of money traded in the ETF on a daily basis. The top ETFs by daily dollar volume are still ETFs tied to the biggest indexes, mainly the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq 100. Top ETFs by average 3-month daily dollar volume SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) $27.7 billion Invesco QQQ (QQQ) $15.3 billion iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) $5.7 billion iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) $3.9 billion Source: Strategas However, the fifth-largest ETF by average daily dollar volume in the last three months is the ProSharesUltraPro QQQ, which provides three times leveraged exposure to the Nasdaq 100. Altogether, five of the top 20 ETFs by average daily dollar volume are leveraged/inverse. Leveraged/inverse ETFs: largest avg. 3-month daily dollar volume ProSharesUltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) $3.8 billion Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3X (SOXL)$2.1 billion Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2x (TSLL) $1.5 billion ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) $1.4 billion GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA (NVDL) $1.3 billion Source: Strategas

Resilient stock market finally succumbs to pressure from economic worries and Trump policy flux,"A new movie due out next month called ""Novocaine"" is about a guy unable to feel pain. This is a kind of superpower, right up to the point where it becomes a keen danger, leaving him insensitive to damaging injury. The stock market, similarly, was for weeks calm and unflinching against potential sources of hurt, until on Friday the indexes recoiled under the cumulative pressure of a slow-motion economic-growth scare, against a noisy backdrop of policy flux. Prior to the shaky action Thursday and Friday, the market had been in ""immaculate rotation"" mode, a deeply split tape passing the baton from sector to sector, growth to value and back, mostly in stride. Buyers showed just enough exertion Tuesday and Wednesday to lift the S & P 500 a quarter of a percent to a marginal new record high each session. This qualifies as resilience, though of an equivocal sort. Warren Pies, co-founder of 3Fourteen Research, notes that the index logged a new record with only 5.5% of its members hitting a 52-week high, less than half the average on past days of a fresh S & P 500 high. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500, 1-year This isn't an odds-on sign of deep trouble to come, but such behavior has meant a less-emphatic signal of good future returns, while making the market a bit more accident-prone. I noted on CNBC Thursday that the market was like a team with a great record in very close games. Many fans view this as a mark of a great team. Yet, in fact, the best teams simply play fewer close games thanks to their dominance. (Apologies for the harsh reminder, Chiefs fans.) Scott Chronert, U.S. equity strategist at Citi, captured the vibe entering Friday: ""Higher rates, lesser Fed cuts, DeepSeek, tariffs, and softer guidance despite impressive Q4 results all could have weighed more substantially on headline indices. Instead, we continue to trade near 25x trailing earnings, the index remains fully valued per our [discounted cash flow] work, and it has posted a total return of 3.8% year-to-date through yesterday's close. While 2025 upside is a far cry from back-to-back 20%+ years, it is still nothing to scoff at. Breaking strong sentiment will take more than that."" 'Growth scare' Whether this steadfast investor risk tolerance was buckled by Friday's 1.7% tumble in the index — driven by consumer and industrial cyclical stocks and accompanied by a squeeze lower in Treasury yields – is next week's business. The setback was a function of a pileup of factors, as most pullbacks are. Friday's sour University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading showed decidedly downbeat expectations for household finances in coming years and a pop in inflation expectations. While unwelcome, this might have been dismissed as a fickle and politically inflected data series had it not been preceded by Walmart's cautious first-quarter guidance, the shortfall in January retail sales, a soft services-sector gauge and rollovers in some travel-and-dining stocks. No one is plausibly inferring a high risk of imminent U.S. downturn from all this, but it complicates the ""no economic landing plus policy accelerants"" belief that prevailed around the turn of the year. A soft patch or stutter-step in the pace of activity, perhaps, with the cacophonous proposals for Federal layoffs, promised tariffs and threatened spending cuts implying a front-loading of fiscal restraint before any potential deregulatory and tax tailwinds kick in. What we can say for sure is that the S & P 500 has slouched back to levels first reached in early December. And the one-time beacons of the cyclical-acceleration ""Trump trade"" – industrials, bank stocks and small caps – have all retreated back into, or below, the gap left by their ferocious Nov. 6 rally, the day after the election. A reset in prices and a rethink of certain assumptions, at minimum. But not a refutation of the broader bull case just yet. Tough seasonality ahead Pies, of 3Fourteen, has been on watch for a ""growth scare"" since the start of the year. Not a recession or the end of the bull market, but a stingier phase susceptible to bouts of unease and downside tests. On Thursday he published an update to his 2025 call, saying that ""our caution around the collision of negative seasonality, a looming tax drain, weak spring housing data, and a dicey March Fed meeting is not obviated by the new highs the S & P made this week."" The negative seasonality refers to a less-friendly historical pattern starting the second half of February, something Goldman Sachs' institutional-equity trading-flow guru Scott Rubner has cited as one reason to place his tactical bullish stance on pause and go ""on the lookout for an equity market correction."" Of course, seasonal effects are background conditions and not predetermined outcomes, with plenty of mismatches between the historical record and actual market action, a few as recently as last year. Seasonal weakness is less a reason to flee from risk than an input to setting realistic expectations for the path ahead. Rubner also point out the tenacious bid from retail traders has begun to tire, something no doubt exacerbated by the sharp reversal in several high-momentum cult favorites among smaller investors. Palantir was pole-axed for a 15% loss last week, Robinhood slid 20% and Tesla is in a 30% drawdown that started two months ago. Bitcoin has failed to play ball by joining the Nasdaq at a new high last week. Broadly speaking, investor sentiment is tough to characterize. Strategas Research notes that the recent pace of equity ETF inflows has run above the 90 th percentile of historical readings and put-call ratios show plenty of upside wagering. The below chart of margin debt from Ned Davis Research shows that growth in investor borrowing is near but not above the threshold that has often meant excessive speculation and market-top potential. Yet survey-based investor attitudes, likely more swayed by headlines of lurching policy gambits, are far more subdued. The AAII investor poll for two weeks has reflected an unusual level of bearishness given the market is near a record high. The late-week turbulence probably spread more healthy skepticism and at least got a start on draining some of the pools of froth that had gathered in some parts of the market. Friday sell-offs The week ended with the fifth straight Friday since the inauguration that the S & P 500 was lower. Coincidence or not, this feeds into a story of pre-weekend apprehension about the unknown next moves from a new administration rushing to dismantle parts of government, threaten allies with tariffs and scramble military alliances. The market has been properly disciplined so far in discounting policy impacts in particular, directly relevant pockets rather than market wide. Even with all those down Fridays, the S & P 500 is up 2.4% for the year and is a mere 2% off its peak. Earnings have come in at the requisite beat rates versus forecasts (better than 75%), even as guidance has been cautious on balance. Credit markets have not sent up any panic flares. A shakeout like Friday's, which pulled the index right to its 50-day moving average, is no dire warning on most timelines in the market multiverse. And for a market trying to navigate the roiling wave action caused by high expectations and elevated valuations interacting with a wait-and-see Fed and a newly hesitant consumer, it's all still pretty routine for now, even if not entirely painless.",2025-02-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/22/resilient-stock-market-finally-succumbs-to-pressure-from-economic-worries-and-trump-policy-flux.html,cnbc
The earnings picture for stocks is deteriorating. How worried investors should be,"There's a lot riding on earnings in 2025. Last year saw double-digit earnings growth in the S & P 500 , and the market is counting on another year of double-digit gains to power stocks higher. Unfortunately, earnings estimates for the first quarter have been slipping fast. On Jan. 1, earnings for the first quarter were expected to be up 12.2%. Now, that is down to 8.5%. That's a decline of 3.7 percentage points, making it the biggest downward quarterly revision since the fourth quarter of 2023. (Walmart on Thursday was the latest example of poor guidance, saying earnings for the fiscal year may fall short of expectations.) Source: LSEG While that is not a huge downward revision, we still have another six weeks to go in the quarter. ""I think the acceleration of the revision thus far is noteworthy at the very minimum,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, said in an email to CNBC. What's causing the decline in S & P earnings estimates? The good news is that so far the companies that are seeing the biggest downward earnings revisions add up to a fairly small group, and there are some obvious reasons why analysts are lowering estimates. Here are the companies that are making the biggest contribution to that decline of 3.7 percentage points. Biggest contributors to the decline in Q1 earnings estimates (change in percentage point) Ford down 0.41 Chubb down 0.22 Apple down 0.21 Travelers down 0.20 Allstate down 0.12 Bristol Myers Squibb down 0.11 Tesla down 0.11 Boeing down 0.10 Source: LSEG What this means is that Ford , for example, is responsible for 0.41 percentage point of that decline of 3.7 percentage points in the S & P 500 estimates. There are a few points to be made about this list: There are several insurance companies ( Chubb , Travelers , and Allstate ) which have all mentioned losses related to the Los Angeles wildfires. There are a couple of auto companies like Ford and Tesla . Ford projected up to $5.5 billion in losses in its electric vehicle segment this year. There's Boeing, which reported a fourth-quarter loss of nearly $4 billion due to production quality issues and a machinist strike. Another factor that may be impacting estimates is continued dollar strength, which is weighing on U.S. companies with large overseas business. Companies like Amazon, Honeywell and Levi Strauss gave disappointing sales forecasts as they said the stronger dollar will continue to be a significant burden in the coming months. Here's the good news First, the group of companies getting downward revisions is relatively small, in different industries, and there are obvious reasons for revisions. Second, aside from a small downward revision by Apple analysts, Big Tech is not — yet — a large contributor to the earnings decline. Third, analysts are not dramatically lowering estimates for companies that could be affected by full implementation of tariffs — yet. Analysts are saying, in effect, that we don't know if these are going to be implemented, so we are not making any dramatic adjustments thus far. But here is a warning from Ford's call: ""There's no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse [effects] on the US jobs, as well as the entire value system in our industry."" Here's the bad news What drove the S & P 500 up last year was large earnings beats by big cap tech, particularly the Magnificent Seven. 2024 earnings Magnificent Seven: up 36.5% Ex-Magnificent Seven: up 6.4% Source: LSEG While big cap tech is still providing positive earnings surprises, the rate of change is slowing down. Magnificent Seven earnings are still growing, but they are decelerating. 2025 earnings (estimates) Magnificent Seven: up 16.9% Ex-Magnificent Seven: up 9.9% Source: LSEG That means betting that Nvidia shares, for example, will be up another 171% (as it was in 2024) is very problematic. The bottom line: Earnings are still growing for Big Tech, but the growth is decelerating. This is putting a lot of pressure on the other 493 stocks. Earnings have to expand because there is very little room for the market multiple to grow The S & P 500 is currently trading at a multiple (price-to-earnings ratio) of 22.6, just off the multi-year high of 23.1 in early December and well above its long-term average of roughly 17. High multiples like these mean that investors are paying more than the historic average for each dollar of earnings. It's a sign investors are expecting significantly higher profits in the next year. Now the profits have to deliver, or the market is not going to keep hitting new highs. Some are hopeful that some overseas earnings growth will occur this year. Many are encouraged that overseas stocks — Europe and China — are finally showing some signs of life. ""You are seeing Europe perk up, China stimulus is in place, so you could see higher earnings growth than that, and that 22 multiple won't be so scary,"" Chris Hyzy, managing director and chief investment officer supporting Bank of America Private Bank, said on our air Tuesday .",2025-02-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/the-earnings-picture-for-stocks-is-deteriorating-how-worried-investors-should-be.html,cnbc
The market continues to broaden out as investors ignore tariff and inflation threats,"It's another day with more stocks up than down. The ratio Friday is almost 3:1, advancing stocks to declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange. It's 2:1 on Nasdaq. You'd think with two huge overhangs to the market — Federal Reserve policy uncertainty and tariffs — stocks would be in difficult shape, but that's not happening. Tech is lagging. You'd think that with the S & P 500 up 4% on the year, tech would again be the leader, but most of the best performing technology stocks last year are underperforming, with only Meta a strong standout. Tesla, down 13% Microsoft, down 3.4% Apple, down 2.6% Alphabet, down 2.1% Broadcom, up 0.9% Nvidia, up 1.7% Amazon, up 4.3% Meta, up 25.9% Instead, the market is continuing to broaden out, though not in a huge way. (That's good.) The worst performers of last year — materials, health care, energy, real estate, consumer staples — are among the market leaders this year. Sector Leaders in 2025 Communication Services, up 8.4% Materials, up 7.8% Health Care, up 6.3% Consumer Staples, up 6.0% Energy up, 5.2% Utilities up, 4.8% Industrials up, 4.6% Real Estate, up 4.1% And while the S & P 500 is just shy of a record high, so is the broader Russell 1000 . The average stock is doing fine. 1.) 330 of the 500 stocks in the S & P 500 are up this year – basically two-thirds of the index. 2.) The S & P Equal Weight ETF (RSP) is up 3.6% this year, neck and neck with the S & P 500. 3.) The S & P 500 advance/decline line, after collapsing in December and into mid-January, has recovered and has been sideways for the past few weeks. Momentum indicators are in a trading range, and that's not a bad thing. First, the percentage of stocks trading above their 50-day moving average is at 55%. After falling off a cliff in December and the first half of January (it was as low as 15%), it's back to where it was in mid-January. Also, another closely watched momentum indicator, the percentage of stocks above their 200-day moving average, is also at 56%, about where it was after the recovery in mid-January. For now, that is good enough. ""More typical after a peak would be a continued weakening, but not so far,"" Frank Gretz at Wellington Shields said in a note to clients today. Earnings for the fourth quarter have been outstanding, and there is only modest slippage for first quarter and full year estimates. With 75% of the S & P reporting, fourth-quarter earnings are up 15.3%, according to LSEG. Seventy-five percent are beating estimates — above the average of 67%. And companies are beating by a wide margin: 6.3% above expectations, which is well above the long-term average of 4.2% above estimates. These are outstanding numbers. First-quarter estimates, which started 2025 up 12.2%, have slipped to 8.5%. Estimates typically decline in the first half of a quarter as analysts adjust their optimistic estimates downward to respond to the usually more cautious comments from CEOs on earnings calls. ""Cuts to forward quarter estimates are the norm, and the size of cut so far is in line with the historical average at this stage in prior earnings seasons,"" Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients this week. For 2025 as a whole, estimates have slipped only modestly, to 11.4% from 14.0% on Jan. 1. Given these numbers — and the fact that we are just on the edge of new highs on the S & P 500 and Russell 1000 — the market seems to be saying that it is not yet worried about one or no rate cuts this year, nor does it believe that there will be a massive implementation of tariffs. If that were the case, earnings estimates would likely drop into the mid-single digits. That is definitely not priced into the market now.",2025-02-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/the-market-continues-to-broaden-out-as-investors-ignore-tariff-and-inflation-threats.html,cnbc
Stuck stock market is worried about economic growth as Trump's tariffs dominate headlines,"The stock market is rather calm but can't seem to relax. In a noisy and fast-shifting news environment, stocks were quietly flattish last week from point to point, even after Friday's almost 1% drop, which extends a sideways three-month range during which the S & P 500 has traded no more than 3% above or below its closing level from the day after the U.S. election. The index has been sticky near the 6,000 level, caught between the opposing currents of a deeply split market, in which stocks and sectors are moving their own way rather than as a bloc. Helps explain why the CBOE S & P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) has been testing its recent floor near 15 in recent weeks. Is this action best understood as resilience, fatigue or confusion? A bit of each, most likely. The market action suggests investors are comforted by a sturdy economic starting point and the consensus will not easily surrender their faith in a ""growth-friendly"" policy mix to come. Yet day to day, the many-forked path of policy-setting involving tariffs, immigration crackdowns, executive-branch program curbs and, eventually, a tax-and-spending package has sapped market confidence in an imminent economic acceleration. Many of the textbook ""Trump trades"" pricing in a strong growth impulse driving a higher-nominal-growth economy have largely unwound. The small-cap Russell 2000 has rolled back to mid-October levels. And as shown here, the beloved industrial sector has also slid back relative to the broader market. The selective nature of the tape is also visible in the waning proportion of large stocks that remain in a technical uptrend. This chart from Strategas Research shows the percentage of such stocks slipped just below 60%, lowest in more than a year. It's a testament to the market's recent knack for clockwork rotations and the constant aggression of small retail traders ( detailed here last week ) that the index has stayed within a couple of percent of record highs even as broad momentum is lacking and so many individual stocks consolidate. It's tough to deny that the clench-and-release of tariff threats is the proximate mover of tactical trading flows and the public mood. The S & P 500 low for last week came less than an hour after Monday's opening bell, when 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico were freshly imposed. A 3% multi-day relief rally from there eventually took the S & P 500 to a high right at 6,100 – upside resistance unless and until proven otherwise – on Friday morning. That was just before the University of Michigan consumer survey showed a big jump in one-year inflation expectations, almost certainly tied to tariff fears, with stocks legging lower still after President Trump vowed ""reciprocal tariffs"" on countries now imposing duties on U.S. goods. Stocks fell 1% from there into the weekly close. 'Growth scare' Still, beyond the daily games of headline pinball, investors as a group understand, or should, that whatever ultimate tariffs are or aren't imposed will likely not be the deciding factor in whether the economic expansion and bull market persist. The trade balance in goods isn't crucially important to the trajectory of the entire U.S. economy in a given year. A tariff conflict, rather, is treated by the market as a ""war of choice"" that might have positive eventual objectives but in the here and now threatens to throw sand in the gears of commerce and kick dust into the eyes of CEOs and capital allocators. More tangibly, an aggressive tariff war could be one more thing inviting the sort of ""growth scare"" the markets have come to consider a possibility. Friday's job number , 145,000 for January, was light at the headline level though broadly ""fine"" given upward payroll revisions for prior months, weather disruptions and a dip in the unemployment rate. But along with a sluggish hiring rate from the JOLTS survey and tepid employment gains outside of services and the public sector, it suggests a low-velocity, steady-state labor market. 3Fourteen Research co-founder Warren Pies has been on ""growth scare"" alert for a while now, seeing a hobbled housing sector, interest-rate-constrained consumers and reduced fiscal liquidity — potentially exacerbated by a Federal Reserve unwilling to ease further given tariff effects on inflation. He also notes that in the years following a 20%-plus gain in the S & P 500, payments for capital gains the following spring tend to unsettle the stock market by early in the second quarter. This is all swirling around a market that came into 2025 priced for good things to happen, with investor expectations high, making it tough for reality to surprise pleasantly. Earnings growth in aggregate has been strong, with the usual rate of outperformance against forecasts. Barclays strategist Venu Krishna calculates that ""the median miss (-3.3%) among companies that printed below-consensus EPS was not much worse than recent quarters. Despite this, the share price reactions have been notably worse, with average post-print move in reaction to an EPS miss nearly [one percentage point] lower than the long-term average."" Krishna adds that revisions to estimates for first-quarter profits outside of the tech sector are running a percentage point weaker than the historical norm, concluding that ""we think markets will find plenty to nitpick by the end of this reporting season."" Magnificent 7 underperformance Alphabet shedding 9% and Amazon losing 4% last week after solid results but subdued guidance and radically increased capital-spending plans could be called nitpicks. The Magnificent 7 giants of the Nasdaq as a group have underperformed the S & P 500 by six percentage points since just before the Fed's ""hawkish rate cut"" Dec. 19. And so, the market so far has indeed grown less beholden to those names- just as the vociferous consensus has insisted would happen for many months - though the overall index is flat since then. The crowd calling for a more inclusive market like to insist that stocks outside those seven dominant tech leaders look considerably less expensive. Yes and no. While there is a decent gap between the forward price/earnings ratio of the top seven and the ""other 493,"" in absolute terms the rest of the market trades at a 19 multiple, above most periods in history. This is why the call for a broadening of earnings growth is crucial to the 2024 bull case for the rank and file of the market. Of course, as they say, valuation is a weighing machine with little to say about what comes next, while stocks on a shorter frame are a voting machine. And right now, the most active retail-trading voters continue to bombard the market with aggressive buying in their favorite momentum names. Dollar volume in retail favorite Palantir Technologies shares on Friday was almost double that in Apple , a company with 13-times its market value, on no fresh news aside from Palantir's torrid stock-price momentum itself, which carried the stock up 38% for the week and 370% over the past year. JPMorgan equity-trading analysts calculated that retail-trader sentiment on Wednesday was the highest the desk ever recorded, based on flow metrics, even ""higher than the peak of the meme mania in 2021."" In the immediate term, JPMorgan says, the market tends to perform well on average following such extremes in retail buying over the next two weeks, after which the signal loses any value.",2025-02-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/stuck-stock-market-is-worried-about-economic-growth-as-trumps-tariffs-dominate-headlines.html,cnbc
The two powerful forces that have kept this bull market from breaking down,"How has the market managed to hold its ground near record highs against a jarring breakdown in the bull market's bell cow Nvidia , a jumpy bond market, some uninspiring results from Apple and Microsoft and on-and-off-and-on tariff threats against the Americas' largest trading partners? By relying on the two most powerful forces blowing through Wall Street: the tenacious bid for stocks among retail investors and an immaculate rotation among sectors that insulates the tape against more violent moves. Whether Friday's sharp intraday wobble on some tariff headlines was a sign that these salutary factors are losing their hold on the market is just one crucial question awaiting investors in February. The generally sturdy economy, expectations of broader earnings growth and a business-fixated administration are the baseline conditions for recent market strength, for sure. Yet the little guy has come up big for the bulls this year, retail investors showing a significantly higher risk appetite in recent weeks than professional fund managers. This is visible in brokerage trading flows, the moonshot performance of Robinhood shares and the active dip-buying reflex in bitcoin . Bank of America's equity trading desk offered the following color on Friday on professional net selling countered by households: ""Hedge Funds led the pack, size-wise, offering their largest sales since July 2023 (which preceded an S & P dip of -10%). [Long-only funds] also sold big, unloading > 50% of what they'd bought over the last four weeks. Outlier? Retail traders - buying-the-dip and buying tech. Retail traders are always net buyers in January, but this year's inflows are twice the size of last year."" Barclays' equity strategy team highlights similar patterns over the course of January, observing ""Both mutual and leveraged funds re-risked only modestly, and their positioning hasn't come back to the 2024 highs. Cash remains king and bonds likely benefited from month-end rebalancing most recently. In contrast, the buoyant Trump trade saw even more equity and crypto buying by the retail cohort in January, pushing households' equity exposure to an all-time high."" Bigger buying than 2021 meme rally This enthusiasm among the non-professional cohort is visible in this chart showing a new high in retail-originated trading volumes, eclipsing the early-2021 burst that emerged from the pandemic momentum- and meme-trading stampede. JP Morgan has likewise been following the tracks of the retail herd, finding a high correlation of daily price moves between more speculative small-cap tech stocks and Bitcoin, plotted here. Both assets are floated on waves of belief in some brilliant and fast-approaching future, which has lately tended to swamp any concern for downside volatility. Look at how the stock price of Robinhood, the signature brokerage platform for today's at-home and on-the-go traders, and Palantir , the software name with the most avid and aggressive retail fan base. Both stocks in recent months finally eclipsed their prior frothy record high set in the frenzy of the 2021 rally in unprofitable tech. HOOD PLTR 1Y mountain Robinhood vs. Palantir, 1-year Now that we've established that retail-investor fervor is a thing, is it a good thing or bad thing? Several things can apply at once. Broader public participation is a core and crucial feature of any bull market, especially one that's been underway for a while. The ordinary investor loving stocks is not a smart reason to start hating them. The typical long-term buy-and-hold amateur will stay in tune with broad market trends and tend to do better than tactical professionals. Yet highly active retail traders in aggregate are prone to herding and as a group fast-money amateurs can overshoot and make the tape more fragile at extremes. Sentimentrader.com has long kept the uncharitably named Dumb Money Confidence index to track a set of transactional behaviors by retail players. It has recently perked up quite a bit as the corollary Smart Money Confidence gauge has pulled back, but at last report was still shy of the readings that have served over time as a signal of oncoming market weakness. Similarly, margin debt tracked by the industry regulator FINRA has gone up steeply, though remains shy of the 2021 peak in absolute terms and is also short of worrisome readings as a percentage of total equity market value. I've noted in recent months that all this retail ferment could well be the market revving toward a true melt-up sort of run at some point, perhaps if the promised wave of IPOs finally crashes ashore. For most of the past two-plus years, the market has paused and retrenched before going into full momentum-froth mode, healing itself, but hard to say if that pattern will continue. The takeaway here is, be watchful of excesses developing and be aware that this crowd can exhaust itself buying dips in the same old favorites. Is something like this happening in Nvidia? The Street flow trackers have noted that small traders have been persistent bidders for Nvidia shares and options on each break, even as fund managers have gradually lightened up in the stock (which is flat over the past eight months). Remarkable rotation Alongside the staunch retail flow, the remarkable rotational choreography has allowed sectors and stocks to alternate leadership responsibilities, withstand occasional mega-cap blowups and suppress index-level volatility. Bull markets always benefit from healthy rotation, which refreshes tired stocks while reinvigorating laggards, as investors choose to shuffle exposures around rather than liquidate portfolios wholesale. But the ""dispersion,"" as it's called, has reached a truly extreme, almost baroque degree lately. Goldman Sachs on Friday calculated that over the prior five trading sessions, the realized volatility for the S & P 500 amounted to a 0.9% daily move. During that same span, the realized vol for the avg stock in the index computes to a 2.8% move. This was the greatest spread between single-stock movement and index changes since late 2020 when the Covid vaccine news and presidential election scrambled the board. Another way of quantifying all this is the CBOE's 3-Month Implied Correlation Index, which uses options pricing to measure the degree to which big stocks are seen to be moving together or independently. We're essentially at a record low for this type of stock-to-stock-to-index linkage. In theory, this should create opportunity for active managers to find stocks that distinguish themselves on their own merits – the dreamed-of ""stock picker's market."" Of course, it also means it's been easier to grab for underperformers and to get caught up in nasty whipsaw rotations. Generally, if tentatively, this to-and-fro action has given a reprieve to the average stock relative to the largest growth winners that dominated the market through the middle of last year. Still, this look at the equal-weight S & P 500 relative to Nasdaq 100 shows the vaunted ""broadening"" hasn't been all that decisive just yet. The heavy flow of retail cash finding its way into a market that has managed to maintain such elegant rotational choreography has been the story of the year so far, and on balance these are helpful attributes. But it doesn't hurt to stay alert for any hints that these forces could wane, should new-year inflows to stocks downshift and the gears running this mechanical rotation start to slip.",2025-02-01 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/01/the-two-powerful-forces-that-have-kept-this-bull-market-from-breaking-down.html,cnbc
The 'great rotation' is finally showing some legs. It's unclear if investors will follow,"As the first month of the year draws to a close, investor hopes for a ""great rotation"" are finally starting to materialize. Everyone is just waiting for the money to show up. The good news is that the stock market has broadened out in January. Ten of 11 S & P sectors are up this month, with only technology down 1%, while health care, energy, financials and Industrials have been leading. S & P Sectors in January Communication Services up 6.6% Health Care up 6.4% Financials up 6.1% Materials up 5.5% Industrials up 5.0% Consumer Discretionary up 4.2% Energy up 4.1% Real Estate up 1.8% Consumer Staples up 1.3% Utilities up 1.1% Technology down 0.5% ""This suggests the rally is broadening out and this is exactly what we have predicted and wanted to see,"" Nick Raich from Earnings Scout said in a recent note to clients. The bad news: the money still isn't there There's an old saying on Wall Street: flows follow returns. That is, when prices of little-loved stocks and sectors start moving, investors eventually start chasing returns. That's what is still missing. Last year, investors poured money into broad technology funds, while pulling money out of other sectors such as health care, energy and consumer staples That trend has slowed but largely continues into January. ETF sector flow leaders in January Technology $3.7 b. inflow Financials $1.8 b. inflow Utilities $600 m inflow Consumer Discretionary $515 m. inflow Communication Services $422 m. inflow Consumer Staples $419 m. inflow Source: ETF Action If technology has consistent inflows, it's the opposite for health care and energy: there have been outflows for over a year, and continued to be outflows in January.\ ETF sector flow laggards in January Energy $1.6 b. outflow Health Care $892 m. outflow Materials $696 m. outflow Real Estate $583 m. outflow Source: ETF Action While these outflows are modest, they mirror the trade for the past year. Bottom line: ""It's still all-in on tech,"" Todd Sohn, head of ETFs for Strategas, told me. Hurdles beyond tech Technology has become a very ""sticky"" investment because investors have been rewarded for owning broad tech funds for a long time. The S & P Technology ETF (XLK) has outperformed the S & P 500 four of the last five years and is up 145% since the start of 2020 vs. an 88% gain for the S & P 500. There are two problems for investors who want to get other investors interested in something besides tech: 1) There is a ""recency bias,"" so investors tend to give a higher weighting to events (returns) that have happened most recently (tech outperforming), and 2) There is a ""Gambler's Fallacy"" bias, where investors who have been on a winning streak owning tech stocks believe their luck will not change (overconfidence bias). We know both of these biases cause investors to make mistakes, in this case by not being well diversified. But nobody wants to believe it until something bad happens. Sohn likens investor unwillingness to abandon tech to the five stages of grief: first there is denial, then anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. Tech investors ""are definitely not accepting the tech rally is over yet,"" Sohn told me. ""I would say we are still in the denial and anger stage. That's a long way from changing the paradigm."" This calculus is made all the more difficult because we don't yet know how this DeepSeek news is going to upend the tech investing paradigm. As of now, it is not dramatically moving the dial. Cathie Wood's ARK fund proves the point Another way to look at how ""sticky"" tech investors can be is to look at the experience of investors in Cathie Wood's flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). From a very small investor base, assets in the ARKK fund exploded in the first months of Covid in March 2020. The price went from the low $40s before topping out around $155 in early February 2021. By the end of 2022, the fund changed hands at $31, an 80% drop in less than two years. But even after the fund topped out and began dropping, investors continued to buy. The fund went from roughly 40 million shares outstanding to over 200 million by June of 2022. At the end of 2023, there were still 180 million shares outstanding. By then the fund was still 65% off its February 2021 high. Only then — nearly three years after the highs — did investors start leaving in large numbers. Today, there are 108 million shares outstanding. Little-loved sectors A lot of people have been waiting for a comeback in health care. Maybe it will come from actively managed funds? Sorry, there just isn't enough of them to make a difference. Even Cathie Wood's ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) has been slowly losing assets since rocketing up in early 2021. What's frustrating is that it's so easy to under-weight technology, should anyone wish. For example, the ProShares S & P 500 Ex-Technology ETF (SPXT), which tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. large-cap stocks excluding the technology sector, has seen a jump in inflows since the end of December. But the fund is small ($187 million), so what this means is a very tiny cohort is making a bet that tech is going to underperform in 2025. But it's still a small group. Bottom line: there are plenty of ways for investors to get exposure to the market ex-technology. As of now, they still don't want to.",2025-01-29 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/a-great-rotation-is-finally-here-unclear-if-investors-will-follow-.html,cnbc
Ron Insana: Consider adding exposure to Europe as U.S. stocks face the risk of a correction,"As fears around the viability of the hot artificial intelligence trade spurred sharp declines in the Nasdaq Composite and the S & P 500 on Monday, it's interesting to note that U.S. markets are notably underperforming those of Europe. Even more interesting is that China's Shanghai Composite, is down 3% year to date, despite the nation's widely heralded advances with DeepSeek , the latest darling in the rapidly growing world of artificial intelligence. As U.S. investors await guidance from the Federal Reserve on the future direction of interest rate policy, as well as policy details from the Trump administration, European investors appear to be betting that the European Central Bank will be friendly. They also seem to be wagering that economic policies in Europe might well favor something of an economic renaissance over there. It is a contrarian play to be sure. Looking overseas for opportunities President Donald Trump has publicly proclaimed a new American ""golden age,"" just as many assume Europe's secular stagnation will continue in perpetuity. I prefer market messages over public proclamations. France's CAC 40 index, and Germany's DAX index are both up about 7% in 2025. The Europe Stoxx 600 index has gained nearly 5% this year. .FCHI .SPX YTD mountain France's CAC 40 index vs. the S & P 500 in 2025 That compares to a roughly 3% advance year to date for the S & P 500, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 2%. The new investing year is starting off with a plate full of uncertainties in the U.S., while the gloom and doom over Europe's current condition is widely known and likely priced into their markets. It could be the right time, after the best two-year performance for U.S. stocks since 1997-1998, to shift some dry powder overseas. Europe could be prime for investing As always, I'd be careful with Asia and emerging markets, as their futures always appear bright but can disappoint — at least from an investment perspective. Europe, in the absence of a more solid relationship with the U.S., may finally be forced to reckon with its own fiscal cliff, slowing growth and dependence on our nation for its continental defense. That could mean right-sizing budgets, slashing interest rates and spending more on defense goods, all of which would be stimulative to European economies — assuming there is no massive trade war with the United States. None of this is to say that I am overtly bearish on U.S. markets. Having said that, Wall Street is richly valued by historic measures, Fed policy is less friendly than once hoped and multiple policies from the Trump administration hold a variety of potential adverse economic and market consequences. All of that leads me to assume a long-overdue market correction of 10% to 15% is in the making. A tactical shift of 10% of one's portfolio, tilting toward developed European markets, might be a decent hedge against near-term volatility here at home. These are thoughts for active traders – not for long-term investors who have been well-served by simply socking away money in U.S. markets for years. Tactical traders, on the other hand, look for short-to-intermediate opportunities to improve portfolio performance and to avoid near-term turbulence in domestic markets. As hard as it's been to be bullish on Europe and cautious on America, the contrarian play is just that. For all the concerns about how the U.S. will treat its allies going forward, some tough love may boost the fortunes of countries across the pond while we sit and ponder what's going on here at home. — CNBC contributor Ron Insana is CEO of iFi.AI, an artificial intelligence fintech firm.",2025-01-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/ron-insana-consider-adding-exposure-to-europe-as-us-stocks-face-correction-risk.html,cnbc
"These 'dividend aristocrats' are growing payouts and are good places to hide, says Wolfe Research","Investors could find a safe haven in a collection of dividend stocks that lessen risk and provide steady income in uneven markets, according to Wolfe Research. Stocks are off to an optimistic start on Monday in response to reports that President Donald Trump could be softening his stance on U.S. trade policy. But investors remain vigilant about the health of the economy. Consumer sentiment has weakened in recent months and, despite some of the tariff proposals being postponed or narrowed, the rhetoric from the White House has helped create uncertainty that has kept gains for equities in check in 2025. Against this backdrop, Wolfe Research is recommending so-called dividend aristocrat stocks, which the firm touts as able to perform well before and during recessions. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividends in each of the past 25 years. In addition to being members of the S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index , companies included on the Wolfe list also had to have above-market dividend growth over the past 12 months, and fall into the second quintile of stocks as measured by their dividend yield. Here are some of the names that popped up on Wolfe's screen. Walmart , the country's largest retailer, made the list. The stock is down about 4% in 2025, and pays a dividend equal to a yield of roughly 1.1%. Shares were under pressure earlier in the year after Walmart warned in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit report of slowing profits moving forward. Virtually all analysts polled by FactSet are standing behind the stock, with 91% maintaining a buy rating on Walmart. The average price target from analysts surveyed by FactSet calls for nearly 27% upside over the coming 12 months. WMT YTD mountain Walmart stock in 2025. Elsewhere, soap and detergent maker Procter & Gamble also made the cut. Shares have slipped about 1% in 2025, and Procter & Gamble pays a dividend equal to a yield of 2.4%. The company remains on stable footing despite concerns tied to consumer spending. Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane recently called Procter & Gamble a ""reliable"" compounder of returns that the market continues to reward. Analysts polled by FactSet have a mostly favorable view of Procter & Gamble, with 61% of those surveyed rating shares a buy. The average price target from those analysts' forecasts implies nearly 10% appreciation. PG YTD mountain Procter & Gamble stock in 2025.

Here are the most oversold stocks due for a technical bounce after another tough week,"Following another difficult week for the markets, certain stocks are showing oversold signals, meaning they may be due for a comeback. Fears of a recession and tariff uncertainty continued to pressure stocks. The S & P 500 and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out narrow gains on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%. The broad market index managed to break a four-week losing streak, however. Amid this tumultuous backdrop, CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to identify the most oversold stocks on Wall Street, through their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI reading below 30 are considered oversold, signaling a positive move higher may be in store. Check out this screener in detail here . A few consumer-focused names made this week's oversold list. Retailers Costco and Target were among them. Target has a 14-day RSI score of just 19.13. Shares finished 0.6% lower on the week, and it is down more than 16% in March. The company recently warned that February sales were soft and that it sees a ""meaningful"" drop in first-quarter profit compared with a year earlier. Analysts are optimistic on the stock's upward potential, even as Target shares have suffered. Consensus price targets call for upside of more than 32%, per LSEG. TGT YTD mountain Target shares in 2025 Meanwhile, Costco has a 14-day RSI reading of around 28.9. Shares rose 0.6% for the week, but shares are still down more than 13% in March. The retail giant has had a difficult month after posting an earnings miss in the fiscal second quarter. However, going by the average price target on Costco shares, the stock could see a rebound of about 19%, according to LSEG. Analysts also largely hold a buy or strong buy rating on the stock. Shoe retailer Deckers Outdoor is another heavily oversold name that could soon see a comeback. Deckers, which has a 14-day RSI of about 21.6, declined 0.7% during the week. Shares are down 15% in March and are nearly 42% lower year to date. However, the consensus price target indicates it may be heavily oversold. Analysts estimate shares soaring nearly 85% from current levels, and most have a strong buy or buy rating, per LSEG.",2025-03-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/oversold-stocks-due-for-a-technical-bounce-after-a-tough-week.html,cnbc
"Steady stocks that beat the market during rough times, according to Bank of America","Buying stocks with a history of outperforming in previous sell-offs could be a good strategy to weather volatility, according to Bank of America. President Donald Trump' s new trade policies have roiled markets in recent weeks, with investors abandoning riskier assets and scrambling to safe havens. Indeed, the S & P 500 is down about 7% over the past month, and the index briefly slipped into correction territory last week. Recent data has also suggested a softening in consumer sentiment , and the Federal Reserve this week said it sees higher inflation and slowing economic growth. Against this highly uncertain economic backdrop, analysts at Bank of America screened for the companies that have a history of performing well during pullbacks. ""With increasing uncertainty over the macro, stocks with a history of weathering prior downturns with low crowding risk and low earnings volatility may make sense,"" Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist, wrote in a Thursday report. To be included in the table below, stocks had to meet the following criteria: Be a member of the Russell 1000 Outperformed in at least 80% of prior market pullbacks of at least 10% since 1983 Have a high-quality rating (B+ or better S & P quality rank) Be underweight by long-only active fund managers (relative weight in holdings < 1.0) The ""hit rate"" column describes the percentage of times the stock has outperformed in pullbacks of at least 10% since 1983. Two names on the list were household product names Church & Dwight and Clorox , which respectively have hit rates of 90% and 81%. Both stocks are also dividend payers, with Church & Dwight having a dividend yield of 1.1%, while Clorox has a dividend yield of 3.4%. Shares of Church & Dwight have added 4% over the past 12 months. Clorox stock is down more than 3% over the past year. Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane recently highlighted the names as two that could weather risks associated with Trump's trade policies. ""We see companies with more domestic exposure as better positioned (CHD, CLX) vs. multi-national peers, which face greater pressure and volatility from a changing tariff and FX environment,"" he wrote. Spillane's $112 price objective is nearly 4% above where shares of Church & Dwight closed on Wednesday afternoon. His $172 price target for Clorox implies a potential upside of 18%. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has risen 4% over the past 12 months. The stock has outperformed in previous corrections 88% of the time, Bank of America found. Johnson & Johnson has a dividend yield of 3%. Earlier this month, the bank's analyst Tim Anderson raised his price target on the stock to $171 from $159. His updated forecast is nearly 5% above where shares closed on Wednesday. ""Upside risks to our PO are better-than-expected launch of new products, pipeline success greater than we model, quick resolution of talc litigation, and constructive M & A that adds to topline growth,"" he wrote. Other names on the list included PepsiCo , with a hit rate of 88%, and NextEra Energy , with a hit rate of 91%.",2025-03-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/steady-stocks-that-beat-the-market-during-rough-times-per-bank-of-america.html,cnbc
These buy-rated stocks are now trading at sharp discounts to their historical valuations,"Stocks have sold off sharply over the past month, leaving several prominent companies trading at steep discounts to their historical valuations, suggesting a bounce back might be on the horizon. The S & P 500 was down 7.5% in a month in early trading Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 6% in a month. The Nasdaq Composite was harder hit, dropping 11.4%, putting the tech-heavy index firmly in a correction. Several stocks have seen severe pullbacks as geopolitical turmoil and mounting recession fears have rocked markets, but the recent sell-off has also transformed some into what might prove good buying opportunities. CNBC Pro used LSEG data to find companies in the S & P 500 that are highly recommended by analysts and that look cheap, using historical measures of value. The stocks that follow are selling between 25% and 50% below the past five year's average price-to-earnings ratio. Each one also boasts a consensus buy rating from Wall Street analysts, and boast average 12-month price targets that are at least 30% above where the stocks trade today. Take a look at the stocks below: Technology stocks have been battered in the sell-off, dragged down by not only macroeconomic headwinds, but also concerns about a slowdown in artificial intelligence investment. E-commerce giant Amazon is now trading at an attractive valuation after pulling back by roughly 12% over the past month. Amazon is trading 38% below the past five years' average trailing P/E ratio. Wall Street is bullish on the megacap, with analysts forecasting more than 35% potential upside. JPMorgan reiterated Amazon as an overweight on Tuesday, saying it remains a top stock idea and should gain retail market share in the event of a future recession due to its low prices, wide selection and growing sales of staples. Energy is the best-performing sector in the S & P 500 this year, but Diamondback Energy and Devon Energy are a couple of standout names in the group that have attractive valuations. Diamondback shares are down 13% over the past six months, while Devon has fallen 26% over the past year. Diamondback is trading at a trailing P/E of 10, about 34% below its average P/E over the past five years. Devon's multiple is about 33% below its five-year average.

Goldman recommends these cheap and stable stocks to survive the market volatility,"Investors should focus on buying stable stocks at a lower valuation as uncertainty grows due to policies out of Washington, according to Goldman Sachs. The stock market has been under pressure recently, with the S & P 500 briefly dipping into correction territory last week. The broad market index struggled again on Tuesday, losing more than 1%. Traders have been fearful that President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from Mexico, China and Canada — along with a slew of cuts to government spending — could spark a sharp economic slowdown. Trump warned this month that the economy will likely undergo a transition , though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this does not mean a recession is likely to happen . ""As policy uncertainty (particularly around tariffs) weighs on market sentiment and growth expectations, investors have been increasingly looking to play defense as evidenced by recent outperformance of lower volatility stocks,"" Goldman Sachs' Deep Mehta wrote in a Monday note. ""To that end, we focus investors on identifying stocks that offer not only low market-relative stock price volatility but also fundamental stability, as measured by defensible revenue streams with low variability, solid forward growth and financial returns profiles alongside still attractive valuations vs. history,"" Mehta added. Goldman screened for stocks that met the following criteria: Year-over-year sales growth volatility of 11% or less over the past 20 quarters Average sales growth of 5% or more over the past 20 quarters A ratio of the above metrics of 1 or less, which is indicative of ""a more attractive combination of low sales volatility and positive sales growth"" Stocks trade 5% or more below their historical multiples Stocks on the list are rated buy Beverage company PepsiCo made the list. Shares have ticked down about 2% in 2025, outperforming the S & P 500's decline of roughly 5%. Shares are currently trading at a roughly 17 times forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared to its five-year average of 24 times. Analyst Bonnie Herzog noted that Pepsi's long-term growth catalysts remain key catalysts for the stock, which include efforts such as automation in its business. PEP YTD mountain PepsiCo stock in 2025. ""Look for the company's impressive revenue growth management capabilities, its owned distribution network and superior supply chain to drive growth opportunities in beverages, particularly across developing and emerging markets,"" the analyst said. Trash and recycling pickup company Waste Management also made the list. Shares are trading at 13 times forward earnings. That is below its five-year average of 14 times. Analyst Jerry Revich said he sees ""resilient high-single digit unit profitability"" for Waste Management's core solid waste segment, despite the loss of a tax credit for using alternative fuel.

"These attractive stocks are trading at deep discounts after sell-off, according to KeyBanc","There's at least some good news in the wake of President Donald Trump's haphazard rollout of tariff policy: a group of fundamentally strong stocks are now very cheap. Growing uncertainty around the Trump administration's trade policy toward China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union has unsettled markets over the past month, sending the S & P 500 into a 10% correction at one point late last week. Since New Year's, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 7.9% this year, the S & P 500 is lower by 3.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 2.1%. Against those declines, analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets compiled a list of stocks that look attractive after the market sell-off, offering investors economically resilient business models that are relatively immune to changing tariff and trade policy. Here are a few of the names KeyBanc highlighted: One name on the list was Swiss athletic shoe and apparel maker On Holding . KeyBanc said the company has maintained its momentum in all key markets, with little to no sourcing exposure. Shares have surged 42% over the past 12 months. Wall Street analysts reiterated their optimism following On's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, reported earlier this month. ""ONON is a highly innovative athletic footwear brand well positioned to gain share,"" said Bank of America analyst Thierry Cota, who called the company a ""home run."" ""We expect its superior growth to be fueled by strong brand heat momentum and product diversification opportunities."" Cota's $73 per share price target is roughly 57% above where the stock closed Friday. That bullish sentiment was echoed by UBS analyst Jay Sole, who similarly has a $73 price target. ""We think On's continued focus on innovation, performance, athletes, sports, direct-to-consumer selling, and maintaining a premium, full-price brand image will lead to industry leading sales growth and earnings beats,"" Sole said. Among industrials, KeyBanc highlighted military vehicle manufacturer Oshkosh . The bank has a $132 price target on the stock, implying nearly 38% upside. ""We think OSK will be relatively immune to tariffs because as of 2024 ~84% of OSK's revenue came from the U.S. with much of it produced domestically,"" KeyBanc analysts wrote. ""Additionally, OSK's global manufacturing footprint should allow it to shift production to help mitigate much of the potential impact. Finally, we think OSK would be quick to increase prices to help offset any tariff impact it couldn't avoid by other means."" Shares of Oshkosh have slumped 18% over the past 12 months. Medical and diagnostic maker Danaher is down nearly 15% over the past year, but KeyBanc analysts see the stock rising 47% over the coming year to their $310 price target. Analysts at Wolfe Research echoed that bullishness earlier this month, adding Danaher to their ""Alpha List."" ""We are adding DHR as we believe the recent selloff should provide an attractive entry point into a longer-term growth & margin outperformance story,"" Wolfe Research wrote. ""DHR should be positioned for upside to consensus '25 EPS estimates, and more importantly, we are confident that this team will be able to instill conviction in a path back to [high single digit] organic growth & [low double digit]+ EPS growth over the next 12 months.""",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/good-stocks-are-trading-at-deep-discount-after-sell-off-keybanc-says.html,cnbc
"Here are some steady performers in any type of economy to ride out the correction, says Evercore ISI","Evercore ISI has a fresh list of picks for investors looking to come out on top amid the volatility that's likely to continue in the year ahead. President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff decisions have led to choppy daily market moves and stoked fears among investors, who are also grappling with concerns about higher-for-longer inflation. Although stocks rebounded on Friday, the S & P 500 officially fell into a correction on Thursday, ending the day more than 10% off its record close, and the Nasdaq Composite remains in correction territory. All three major U.S. stock indexes are down more than 5% this month. To find some bright spots after this downturn, analysts at Evercore identified several stocks they called ""all-weather outperformers,"" or companies that after the market sell-off in recent weeks are now fetching a price and a valuation at odds with the strength of their underlying fundamentals. ""Volatility creates opportunity,"" Evercore ISI senior managing director Julian Emanuel said in a note to clients. ""These dislocations have created the potential for shares of the highlighted companies to outperform the S & P 500 over the next 12 months irrespective of how the myriad uncertainties resolve themselves."" Walmart and Exxon Mobil are among the firm's outperform-rated picks. Take a look at more below: Walmart, a big-box retailer popular among a wide range of consumers, has been especially attractive amid concerns about inflation, high grocery prices and the direction of the U.S. economy. The company is also a dividend aristocrat , having raised dividends for at least 25 years. In fact, Walmart recently announced a 52nd year of dividend hikes. Although the company warned that its profit growth will slow this fiscal year, Evercore ISI remains bullish on the name with a $100 price target that suggests at 17% potential upside. Walmart's shares are down 5.5% year to date, but still up roughly 40% over the past year. Chipotle 's stock has been battered about 17% this year, but it's another ""all weather"" pick from Evercore ISI. The firm's price target of $72 suggests Chipotle shares can gain nearly 44% over the next year. Chipotle on Friday notably rose about 2.7% after the burrito chain received an upgrade to buy from hold from Loop Capital, which said the recent pullback in the stock has created an attractive buying opportunity and that the name is good for managing tariff-related risks, as the company sources only about 2% of its total inputs from Mexico. Other stocks Evercore ISI thinks can ride out the market volatility include Procter & Gamble and CVS Health . CVS shares are up 48% this year, outperforming its rivals and the broader market's performance as investors are optimistic about the pharmacy chain's ability to reach its full-year 2025 adjusted earnings outlook and achieve its savings goal by cutting costs. Evercore ISI's price target of $80 suggests shares have 21.8% additional upside from Friday's close.

Here are the most oversold stocks due for a trader’s bounce following the market rout,"The market just saw its fourth straight week in the red, but there are some stocks that are so washed out they may be due for a rebound. On Friday, the S & P 500 closed the week down about 2.3%, putting the loss since its Feb. 19 all-time at 8.2%. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished lower, with the latter slumping 4.7%, its worst week in two years . The latest sell-off kicked off on Monday amid sudden concern that the U.S. economy was heading toward a recession. President Donald Trump said in a Fox News interview last Sunday that the economy was experiencing "" a period of transition ,"" and wouldn't rule out a downturn, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had said days before that the economy might see a "" detox period "" as the administration curbs government spending. The losses were soon exacerbated by trade developments, as Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect Wednesday, followed by counter-measures from the European Union (EU) . In response, the president on Thursday threatened to impose 200% tariffs on all alcoholic beverages from the EU after Europe put a 50% tariff on American whiskey. Against all this volatility, CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to identify the most oversold stocks on Wall Street, using their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks that have a 14-day RSI below 30 are regarded as oversold, signaling a possible rebound may be in store. Delta Air Lines – with an RSI of 21.6 – fell 12% last week after the Atlanta-based carrier cut its first-quarter profit and revenue forecasts , citing softer domestic travel demand. Delta is down more than 28% in the past month. Still, the Street is uniformly bullish on the airline. According to LSEG, all 23 analysts covering Delta have the equivalent of a buy rating. That includes Morgan Stanley, which reiterated an overweight opinion on Delta even after its downward guidance. ""We would be buyers of weakness in DAL (and other airline stocks) albeit with some caution around macro/geopolitical developments and overall market sentiment,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker wrote in a report. ""We continue to like the long-term fundamentals at US Airlines and risk-reward still looks very attractive (esp. after the sell-off of the last month) but the market needs to be convinced that we are not headed into a broad consumer-led recession first."" Meanwhile, Target – whose RSI is 16.8 – lost about 9% this week, touching a 52-week low on Friday and bringing its year-to-date decline to nearly 23%. Over the past six months, the retailer has pulled back even more, falling almost 31%. The latest slide came after CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC last Tuesday that Trump's 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico could lead the company and other grocers to increase produce prices . On Wednesday, Target fell nearly 5%. Of the 39 analysts covering Target, 16 rate it the equivalent of buy, while 22 are on the sidelines with a hold rating. Deckers Outdoor is also among the most oversold stocks on the Street, sporting the lowest RSI on our screen at 15.8. Shares of the Uggs boots maker have fallen for seven consecutive weeks, dropping more than 6% in the latest five days.

Goldman gave clients a stable stock list to buy if there's a recession. Here's what's on it,"Goldman Sachs is getting worried about the stock market and the economy, so the firm is giving clients strategies to ride out these coming turbulent times. The investment bank lowered its 2025 year-end S & P 500 target to 6,200 from 6,500 in a research note on Tuesday. The downgrade comes as the S & P 500 has fallen 9% from its all-time high over the past three weeks. More than half of this pullback has come from a 14% decline in ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, according to chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin. ""The key market risk going forward is a major further deterioration in the economic outlook,"" wrote Kostin in the note, noting that the S & P 500 declined by a median 24% from peak to trough during recessions. Kostin's team identified stable growers for clients to buy to ride out a possible recession. The firm looked for stocks that have increased cash flow reliably with little variance from year to year over the past decade. The stocks are also projected by Goldman analysts to have stable or higher earnings this year. Here are some of the names in Goldman's stable growth basket: Alphabet is one of the few tech names on Goldman's list of steady growth names. The investment bank forecasts the Google parent company's earnings per share and sales to rise 11% each in 2025. Another Wall Street firm bullish on Alphabet is Evercore ISI, which reiterated its outperform rating on the stock in a note on Wednesday, noting its generative artificial intelligence innovations. Thus far year to date, Alphabet shares have declined nearly 13%. Domino's Pizza was also featured in the basket. Goldman forecasts the pizza chain's sales and earnings per share in 2025 to increase 5% this year. The pizza company announced a stuffed crust offering earlier in the month, 30 years after rival Pizza Hut debuted the menu, in order to win over customers. The stock has added 5% year to date.

"Buy these 'diamonds in the rough' that will lead a market bounce, Evercore ISI says","Heavily shorted companies such as CrowdStrike and beaten-down Advanced Micro Devices could pop if the market manages a rebound, according to Evercore ISI. Fears that President Donald Trump 's trade policies could spike inflation and slow growth, leading to stagflation, have spurred the recent market sell-off as investors attempt to de-risk and find safer growth opportunities. ""The uncertainty has ripped through the 'soft' data, begun to infect the 'hard' data and has resulted in a virtual 'straight line plunge' in the S & P 500, largest correction in two years,"" Evercore ISI senior managing director Julian Emanuel said in a note to clients. To find some potential breakout names, Emanuel searched for stocks that have high short interest and low valuations after the recent sell-off. These names could also see a ""short squeeze"" if the market bounces. A short squeeze occurs when investors who bet against a stock see its price rise and then try to cap their losses by purchasing shares. In turn, this drives the stock price even higher. Emanuel found what he calls the market's ""dislocated diamonds in the rough,"" or stocks whose short interest is in the 90th percentile or higher over the past two years and whose price-to-earnings ratio over the next 12 months is at a discount of 30% or greater to its five-year average. Take a look at the names below: CrowdStrike is trading at a 72% discount to its five-year average and its short interest over the past two years is in the 91st percentile, according to Emanuel's screen. The cybersecurity play has had a rocky start to 2025, with shares roughly flat during that time frame. Last week, CrowdStrike issued weak earnings guidance that overshadowed its fiscal fourth-quarter results. The company is still grappling with issues tied to its global IT outage that disrupted businesses around the world in July . AMD has also plunged on the back of lackluster earnings results and a drop in enthusiasm for AI- and tech-related stocks this year. The chipmaker's shares have dropped 17% year to date, and the stock is trading at a more than 40% discount from its five-year average. Beer maker Constellation Brands ' short interest is in the 100th percentile, per the screen. The stock, which is trading at a 32% discount to its five-year average, is down 17% this year.

The declines came one day after all three major averages were routed amid mounting concern on Wall Street that the U.S. faces an imminent recession. Against this volatile backdrop, CNBC Pro screened for S & P 500 companies whose shares have quickly been losing steam. Specifically, we looked for stocks with a relative strength index, or RSI, reading below 30 on Monday and whose RSI has scored below 40 for the past 10 trading sessions. A stock with an RSI below 30 indicates shares are extremely weak and maybe oversold. Below are the stocks that came up in our search: While shares of Tesla , which has an RSI of around 22, advanced more than 5% midday Tuesday, on track to snap a three-day losing streak, the stock has had a rough time in recent weeks. In fact, Tesla has fallen in 10 out of the past 11 weeks. Elon Musk's electrical vehicle maker has plunged more than 46% over the past three months. This week, Musk admitted he is running his myriad businesses ""with great difficulty"" due to his role in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that ""radical left lunatics"" are ""illegally and collusively"" boycotting Tesla , and promised to buy one himself to show support for Musk. Notably, the Street is pretty split on Tesla. According to LSEG, 26 of the 54 analysts covering the stock have the equivalent of a buy rating, while 16 rate it hold. The remaining 12 carry the equivalent of a sell rating. Amazon has an RSI around 26, and its shares have slumped more than 16% over the past month. Amazon fell more than 2% Monday as ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks helped lead the market lower. The Street is still overwhelmingly bullish on the dominant e-commerce platform. Of the 72 analysts covering Amazon, 68 have a strong buy or buy rating, while the remaining four rate it a hold. Their consensus 12-month price target of nearly $265 implies more than 36% upside ahead. ServiceNow and Constellation Energy also showed up on the screen, with an RSI below 30. Shares of ServiceNow have fallen about 30% over the past three months, while Constellation Energy has retreated almost 35% over the past month alone.",2025-03-11 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/these-momentum-stocks-have-lost-their-mojo-according-to-the-technicals.html,cnbc
"These quality stocks on sale are set to beat the market, says Bernstein","As the market sell-off gains steam, a handful of quality stocks could outperform and buck the broader weak trend for equities, according to Bernstein. All three major indexes continued to struggle on Tuesday. These moves follow a sell-off on Monday, with the 30-stock Dow slipping more than 900 points. The index also moved below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 2023. Against this backdrop, Bernstein is focusing on quality stocks that can find growth ahead. The firm pointed out in a Monday note that quality stocks typically rebound 2% to 3% in the three months after a market sell-off. In more pronounced down markets, the uptick is historically 5% to 7%. Bernstein's model to identify quality stocks examines factors including year-over-year sales growth, debt ratios and EBIT margins. Bernstein's quality list includes only preeminent stocks that are considered ""on sale."" Simply sticking with quality stocks alone isn't enough, according to managing director Ann Larson. ""[T]here is a premium associated with quality, and buying top quality today would expose an investor to high valuations relative to historical multiples,"" Larson wrote. ""While there are rarely cheap quality stocks to be had, we can more frequently find them 'on sale,' particularly during market declines."" Here's a look at some of the names on Bernstein's list. All stocks that are featured below are rated outperform by Bernstein. Nvidia made the list. The stock is down nearly 6% over the past week and has pulled back about 19% in 2025. This puts the chipmaker's forward price-to-earnings ratio at roughly 23 times, down from as high as 40 in March 2022 . NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia stock. About 93% of analysts polled by FactSet maintain a buy or outperform rating on Nvidia. Consensus analyst price targets imply more than 66% upside ahead for Nvidia stock. Chipotle Mexican Grill also made the cut. Shares have pulled back more than 16% in 2025. Chipotle stock is still trading at a premium to the S & P 500, with its forward P/E currently sitting at roughly 37. The S & P 500 has a forward P/E of about 20, per FactSet data. CMG YTD mountain Chipotle stock. Despite headwinds such as sluggish same-store sales growth and tariffs from President Donald Trump that could boost avocado costs , analysts remain upbeat. About 75% of analysts surveyed by FactSet have a buy or outperform rating on the stock, and their consensus price target suggests shares could rise 33% from Monday's close.

"Invest in these stocks with ‘stronger fundamentals and less risk,' Piper Sandler says","Heightened tensions around President Donald Trump's tariffs have weighed on the market in recent days, but some stocks could provide investors safety amid persistent uncertainty, according to Piper Sandler. All three major averages closed the past week lower after Trump on Monday said that 25% tariffs would be imposed on goods from Canada and Mexico and that an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods would go into effect. That sent stocks into a tailspin, with stocks seeing their worst week since September. ""Unlike selloffs in recent years, where the transmission mechanism that would provide relief for the market's primary issues (rising CPI in '22, rising 10yr [yield] in '23, rising unemployment in '24) was more predictable, this is different in that the market doesn't quite know how far Trump is willing to go on tariffs or what his reaction function is to 'bad news,'"" wrote Piper analyst Michael Kantrowitz. ""In a way, this is more reminiscent of 2018's 4Q selloff where the market wasn't happy with Powell's policy plans and didn't bottom until he pivoted."" As a result, investors should ""avoid trying to time the market and pick up stocks with stronger fundamentals and less risk that they can underwrite for longer than a trade,"" the Wall Street firm continued. To find such stocks, Piper ran a screen looking for companies that could be set up to outperform in the current economic environment and are positively correlated to U.S. corporate bond risk spreads. Below are some of the names that appeared on the list. Shares of food retailer Kroger rose nearly 5% Friday, touching a new 52-week high and putting the stock's weekly gain at about 3%. By Piper's internal ranking system, Kroger received a macroeconomic select score and corporate bond risk spread score of 1. The move Friday extended Thursday's gains, which came on the back of Kroger forecasting annual same-store sales above analysts' expectations. More than half of sell-side analysts have a bullish stance on the grocery chain, with 13 of 25 having an equivalent of a buy rating, and 12 a neutral option, according to LSEG data. In the past six months, Kroger has far outpaced the broader market, surging almost 28% versus less than 7% for the S & P 500. KR YTD mountain KR, year-to-date Echoing Piper, Morgan Stanley said last week that Dollar General is among the stocks it thinks might be insulated from Trump's tariffs . The discounter, based outside Nashville, has a macro select score of 1 and a corporate bond risk spread score of 2, using Piper's own internal scores. Shares of the discount retailer advanced more than 7% on Friday, capping a weekly gain of more than 10%. Dollar General has done well over the past month, rising almost 13%, but remains lower by more than 48% over the past year. DG YTD mountain DG, year-to-date OIl and gas producer Hess , which climbed almost 3% on Friday, also made it on to Piper's screen, having a macro select score and corporate bond risk spread score of 2.

Six fortress stocks to ride out the tariff market turmoil and generate positive returns,"President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policy has the stock market on pace for a down week, but some defensive stocks could still help investors see gains in their portfolios. Stocks extended their losses on Friday from the previous session, with the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite on pace for their biggest weekly declines since September. The latest sell-off comes on the heels of a weaker-than-expected February jobs report and continued uncertainty regarding U.S. trade with Canada, Mexico and China. The week's multisession declines began Monday, when President Trump announced he would impose 25% tariffs on Tuesday on Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. Against this volatility, CNBC Pro used its Stock Screener Tool , which readers can use to copy this screen or make their own, to find S & P 500 companies that can help investors better withstand the turbulence, and modeled the following criteria: Stock is higher in the past month Has a beta well below 1.0, meaning it is less volatile than the market Dividend yield above 2% Is liked by sell-side analysts, who predict at least a 10% gain over the next 12 months Crop and ingredient company Archer-Daniels-Midland made the list, having a one-month gain of more than 5% and a dividend yield of 4.45%, the highest of all the stocks on the list. ADM 1M mountain ADM, 1-month ADM also has a beta of 0.68, and its average analyst price target implies about 15% upside for the stock from current levels, according to LSEG data. Meanwhile, insurance name Allstate floated to the top. Shares have gained nearly 3% over the past month, and it sports a dividend yield of exactly 2%. ALL 1M mountain ALL, 1-month Allstate is also far less volatile than the market as a whole, with the lowest beta on the screen at just 0.38. Analysts' average price target calls for more than 15% upside ahead, the most of the six stocks on our screen. Shares of Molson Coors earned their spot in the screen partly by paying a dividend yield of some 3.2%, with a below-market beta of 0.72.

"Safe-haven stocks with competitive advantages to ride out the market volatility, according to UBS","Buying stocks with steady profits and a strong competitive edge could provide some protection against the current highly uncertain macro backdrop, according to UBS. Uncertainty around the Trump administration's new tariff policies have increased volatility in recent weeks. Stocks have seesawed back and forth above the flatline to begin the month, but all three major averages were pacing for a weekly decline as of Thursday afternoon. Against this backdrop of heightened trepidation and unpredictability, UBS screened for potential safe-haven opportunities post the most recent market sell-off. ""This screen is designed to identify firms with strong competitive advantages and consistent levels of profitability that exhibit low volatility,"" the firm wrote in a Thursday note. Some of the stocks UBS identified are listed below: UBS highlighted McDonald 's as a potential safe-haven opportunity. The fast-food stock has risen 6% over the past 12 months. ""MCD's CFROI [cash flow return on investment] profile has been very stable over the past 15 years staying near 10% and it hit an all-time high of 13.4% in 2024. CFROI is forecast to remain near current levels over the next two years and the market is pricing for this stability to continue,"" UBS wrote. ""MCD's Economic Profit has been on an increasing trend over the past two decades highlighting the firm's ability to drive wealth creation."" Most analysts covering the stock are currently bullish on its trajectory, while its average price target points to a 7% upside. Philip Morris International was another name on the list. The cigarette producer has soared almost 69% over the past year, rising 28% in 2025 alone. Last month, shares rose 11% in a single day after the Marlboro owner reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, boosted by sales of smoke-free products such as Zyn nicotine pouches. In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Zyn to remain on the market, saying it is safer than smoking traditional cigarettes. Analysts are generally bullish on Philip Morris, although the average price target corresponds to a potential downside of 3%. Life sciences stock Thermo Fisher Scientific has slipped 10% over the past 12 months, but has managed to eke out a 1% gain so far this year. Last month, Bernstein upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from market perform. ""We continue to believe Thermo will be the industry's long-term winner because it is best-positioned to address major industry changes; commercial execution (especially ability to cross-sell) is the most under-appreciated reason why,"" wrote analyst Eve Burstein. ""Although there are many reasons to like Thermo (its innovation; its M & A ability; its strong leadership team...), our favorite is their unique commercial advantage."" Burstein's $630 price target is approximately 19% higher than where shares of Thermo Fisher closed on Thursday. The average price target sees shares rallying even further, around 26%.

"These stocks are the best insulated from Trump's tariffs, according to Barclays","Amid heightened uncertainty from President Donald Trump's trade war, Barclays screened for companies that are more shielded from tariff volatility. The three major stock market averages are down more than 2% so far this week as U.S. tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico took effect and those on China were raised. Stocks have seesawed daily as Trump administration officials and foreign leaders continue to talk through the tariffs and negotiate their exact conditions. With this in mind, Barclays built a list of stocks it believes are the most insulated from tariff barrier headwinds. All are rated overweight at the bank and their average market capitalization is around $47 billion. Here are some of the names that showed up on Barclays' screen: Luxury retailer Tapestry , the owner of Coach and Kate Spade, is one of the stocks on the list. Shares have soared more than 20% in 2025, hitting an all-time high in February, following strong quarterly results and forward guidance. During the company's earnings call on Feb. 6, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe noted that Tapestry's internal forecasts already included the expectation of an additional 10% tariff on goods from China coming into the U.S. Tapestry does not have any production in Canada or Mexico, he added. Tapestry has declined more than 8% this week amid a broad drawdown in retail stocks over worries that higher prices from tariffs will pressure consumer spending. TPR YTD mountain Tapestry shares in 2025 Agriculture machinery company Deere is another company Barclays believes will fare better under tariff uncertainties. The stock took a hit earlier in the week after Trump announced that tariffs would apply to food products. However, shares reversed course and briefly jumped as much as 3.3% Thursday, putting the stock down less than 1% for the week. Shares are up 12.6% year to date, far outperforming the S & P 500. DE 1D mountain Deere & Co. on Thursday Soft drink giant Coca-Cola also made the cut. Asked about the effect of aluminum tariffs, CEO James Quincey said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that Atlanta-based Coke has ""hedging programs in place that look to assure supply and price going out"" into the future to address tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties. ""I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,"" Quincey said. ""It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar U.S. business. And packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure. So firstly, it's not a multimillion-dollar problem relative to the input cost. It's a much more manageable number,"" the CEO said. Shares are down 2.3% for the week, but remain 11.8% higher in 2025.

"Low-beta growth stocks to ride out the Trump roller coaster, according to Trivariate Research","Investors who buy low-beta growth stocks such as Boston Scientific and Mastercard right now could see better performance as a result, according to Trivariate Research. Softening economic data and concerns around the Trump Administration's new tariff policies have given the stock market whiplash. Stocks rallied on the last day of February, started off March in a sell-off and bounced back on Wednesday as the White House offered a monthlong exemption on automobile tariffs, raising optimism for more concessions in the future. Still, investors are divided on whether near-term market volatility can ease, given the number of unknowns regarding the duration and economic consequences of the tariffs. But against this backdrop of heightened caution, investors may be able to carve out gains by holding low-beta growth stocks, according to Trivariate Research, headed by Adam Parker, former chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. A low-beta stock simply flags companies that are less volatile than the broad market, whose beta is 1.0. Stocks with beta below 1.0 are usually less risky, while stocks with a beta over 1.0 may pose more risk with potentially higher returns. ""Because our work convincingly showed that a combination of low- and high-beta growth stocks results in better performance than all average beta growth stocks, investors this week asked us for some specific low beta growth stock ideas,"" the macroeconomic research firm wrote in a recent note. ""These could be good candidates to balance high-beta stocks in a growth portfolio."" In the same report, Parker, Trivariate's founder, shared a basket of high-quality, low-beta growth stocks that are higher year to date. Some of those companies are shown below: One stock Trivariate highlighted was Check Point Software Technologies . The IT security company has surged 40% over the past 12 months through Wednesday, and has risen 19% this year alone. The stock currently has a beta of 0.60. Earlier this week, Piper Sandler upgraded shares to an overweight rating from neutral. Analyst Rob Owens cited improving underlying momentum as a catalyst. ""New management (specifically CEO Nadav Zafrir) has served to galvanize the CHKP story, better positioning it to capitalize on the security opportunity,"" he wrote. ""While this is likely to manifest in incremental improvements to results, we believe the narrative will get better, especially if the company can flirt with double-digit growth in the future — which will drive increased multiple, in our view."" Owens' price target of $260 implies potential upside of 17% from Check Point's Wednesday close. Medical equipment maker Boston Scientific has risen 56% over the past 12 months and 17% since the year began. Shares are currently trading with a beta of 0.58. In January, Deutsche Bank upgraded shares to a buy rating from hold. Analyst Pito Chickering's price target of $108 is about 3% above where the stock is currently trading. ""So the BSX story has become simpler, and as one of the best-in-class medtech names, we believe BSX is poised again to outperform in 2025, and we are upgrading the shares to Buy with a $108 price target which is 34x our 2026E EPS,"" Chickering wrote. With respective betas of 0.55 and 0.50, Mastercard and Visa were two other stocks that Trivariate highlighted as low-beta growth ideas. Shares of Mastercard have risen 19% over the past 12 months, while Visa has climbed 26%. Earlier this week, Mizuho highlighted Mastercard as a potential beneficiary of the Trump administration's tariffs. ""Our bottom-up analysis of consumer spend categories that are directly impacted by potential tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China shows that V and MA could be modest beneficiaries of the pass-through of higher prices to consumers, even after taking into account a potential slowdown in demand,"" wrote analyst Dan Dolev. Dolev currently has an outperform rating on shares of Mastercard and a neutral rating for Visa.",2025-03-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/low-beta-growth-stocks-to-survive-trump-turmoil-according-to-trivariate.html,cnbc
"Best stocks to own during a trade war, according to Evercore ISI","Low-volatility stocks such as Apple and AbbVie could emerge as winners in a trade war, according to Evercore ISI. Weeks of simmering trade tensions have erupted into a global trade war as President Donald Trump 's tariffs on key trade partners Canada and Mexico took effect on Tuesday, leading to retaliatory measures and fears about economic stagnation. The S & P 500 , Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down about 2% week to date as a result. Low-volatility stocks outperformed in February trading as signs of the trade war emerged and uncertainty weighed on markets, Evercore found. These stocks also outperformed during similar trade tensions and tariff uncertainties in 2018, during Trump's first presidential term. ""Defense remains the best offense,"" senior managing director Julian Emanuel wrote in a Monday note to clients. ""With Trade War 2.0 moving to the next act with more tariffs scheduled to come into force starting 3/4, EVR ISI Strategy sees the battle as having been joined, with low volatility leading defensive factor performance in the weeks and months ahead."" He listed a slew of ""trade war heroes."" These names are Russell 3000 stocks that are in the top quintile for low volatility and buybacks. Take a look at the stocks: A slew of health-care giants — including AbbVie , Centene , Humana , DaVita and UnitedHealth Group — could perform well during this trade war, according to Evercore. Health-care stocks are generally considered a defensive hedge in an investment portfolio, as they tend to hold up better than more growth-oriented sectors during an economic slowdown. These stocks mentioned by Evercore have varying performances in 2025, but year to date, the health-care sector is up 8%, making it the top S & P 500 sector during the period, per FactSet data. AbbVie is one name that is having a strong 2025, up 17%. The company posted fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates in late January, and it recently entered the high-flying obesity space. DaVita's shares are down nearly 4% this year, but the kidney health company could be poised for a breakout. A recent chart analysis suggests DaVita could see strong long-term performance compared to the S & P 500. Apple also made the cut as a strong defensive pick. The tech giant has seen shares drop 4.7% this year. Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, said earlier this week that Apple has become the safe-haven play of the ""Magnificent Seven"" since the DeepSeek emergence, as more use of artificial intelligence could lead to a new upgrade cycle for iPhones. Other stocks that could give investors a measure of safety during this trade war are defense stocks Booz Allen Hamilton and Lockheed Martin . Booz Allen is off nearly 16% in 2025, while Lockheed is down more than 6%. These two stocks have suffered this year on concerns that the U.S. could significantly cut defense spending. However, defense contractors are considered to be less tied to the broader market's performance and therefore more reliable during periods of volatility, as they are more dependent on government budgets and war-related activities rather than the state of the economy.",2025-03-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/best-stocks-to-own-during-a-trade-war-according-to-evercore-isi.html,cnbc
"Stocks that are 'more insulated' from Trump's tariffs than their peers, according to Morgan Stanley","Morgan Stanley found a few stocks that could have some cushion from the Trump administration's upcoming tariffs. Levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico are set to take effect on Tuesday. Though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday suggested the duties on Mexican and Canadian products could be lower than the 25% first announced last month, the uncertainty has weighed on the market. The S & P 500 lost more than 1% in February. Moving forward, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson views tariffs as ""more of a rotational driver than an index-centric one, though broader reaching tariffs (outside of China) with higher tariff rates could have a beta impact if they are sustained for an extended period of time."" Against this backdrop, Morgan Stanley sifted the market to find value stocks that could still see growth and are ""more insulated"" under the new tariff regime due to their pricing power and overall market share. Here's a look at some of the names that made Morgan Stanley's list. Ulta Beauty made the list. The stock company has pulled back more than 16% in 2025. The average price target of analysts polled by FactSet implies more than 28% upside for the stock moving forward. Morgan Stanley also upgraded Ulta in January, with analyst Simeon Gutman noting: ""ULTA remains a strong, durable business in a dynamic and attractive category. As the Beauty industry continues to grow, ULTA's top-line should follow."" ULTA YTD mountain Ulta Beauty stock. Apparel company Levi Strauss also made the cut. Shares have ticked up more than 3% in 2025. Levi in January reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, though it also issued lackluster guidance. The company said it expects a strengthening U.S. dollar to be a headwind to sales moving forward. Morgan Stanley has an equal weight rating on the stock, but the FactSet consensus price target on Levi Strauss implies nearly 20% upside. Barclays analyst Paul Kearney earlier in the year initiated the stock with an overweight rating , noting: ""While there are risks to LEVI that are both external and internal, we believe there is opportunity going forward, namely addressing share loss in men's bottoms, improving operational capabilities and assortment optimization as the company further invests behind [direct to consumer], and building agility into the merchandising organization for tops.""

Barclays cuts S&P 500 target to lowest on Wall Street as tariff pressure mounts,"Rising global trade tensions could limit the stock market's gains this year, according to Barclays. Strategist Venu Krishna lowered his 2025 S & P 500 target to 5,900 from 6,600. That implies upside of just 0.3% from where the benchmark began the year. His forecast is now the lowest 2025 outlook among those featured in CNBC Pro's Market Strategist Survey . The reduction comes as the U.S. imposes tariffs on goods from key trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and China. The White House is expected to announce what President Donald Trump refers to as reciprocal tariffs on other countries in early April. On top of that, recent survey data shows consumers and investors are concerned over the U.S. economic outlook going forward. ""Our base case assumes that earnings take a hit as tariffs (higher China tariffs stick but do not escalate, reciprocal tariffs amount to 5% on RoW) contribute to material slowing in US activity that nonetheless stops short of outright recession,"" Krishna wrote. ""Given significant uncertainty around trade policy, our bull and bear case EPS estimates hinge upon the final scope and severity of tariffs (60% probability)."" ""For the bull case, we assume Trump walks back tariffs as political and industry opposition gets louder, easing both trade tensions and headwinds on macro growth, allowing SPX valuations to re-test t12m highs up to 6700 (25% probability),"" he said. ""However, in our bear case, the full impact of Canada and Mexico tariffs, in tandem with reciprocal and China tariffs, creates a much larger direct drag on SPX EPS growth, with second order effects likely pushing US GDP into contraction and the S & P 500 into a bear market down to 4400 (15% probability)."" .SPX YTD mountain SPX year to date A move to 4,400 points to a 25.2% drop from where the S & P 500 started 2025, while a surge to 6,700, would put the index in record territory once more. The benchmark was at an all-time intraday high of 6,147.43 in February. The S & P 500 has been on a roller-coaster ride over the past month, losing 3% during that time. The index also dipped into correction territory, briefly trading more than 10% below its record high before recovering slightly. Krishna upgraded the financial sector to positive, adding that he prefers that sector along with health care and Big Tech going forward. Financials and health care are up 4.6% and 5.6%, respectively, year to date, while the S & P 500 tech sector is down 7.7%. Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

Deutsche Bank says the market sell-off has another 6% to go as consumer and corporate confidence dives,"The market sell-off is not over yet as consumer and corporate confidence take a dive on tariff uncertainty, according to Deutsche Bank.

""With trade policy uncertainty likely to continue to weigh, at least until April 2, we expect positioning to continue to unwind."" ""A move to the bottom of the positioning band which is where it went to in the last trade war, would take the S & P 500 down to 5250,"" Chadha added.

The benchmark was last about 8% below the all-time high it reached just last month. .SPX YTD bar S & P 500 At the center of the strategist's call are concerns of an economic slowdown amid tariff uncertainty that are unlikely to abate for at least the next several weeks. The latest earnings season showed CEOs are slashing capital expenditures and cutting their earnings forecasts. Chadha also expects the idea of a ""Trump put"" — in which the president will ease on his policies that have destabilized the market — will not be realized until a marked turn lower in Trump's approval ratings. ""Compared to the level of consumer confidence, the current approval rating is high, implying plenty of room for downside with negative growth or inflation developments likely to speed the catch down,"" Chadha wrote. ""We expect the net approval rating has to turn more significantly negative, at least -5%, before the administration starts to consider responding."" Still, Chadha, who held one of the more bullish outlooks heading into 2025, said it is ""too early to throw in the towel"" on his year-end target of 7,000, a move that is more than 24% higher from Friday's close. He thinks stocks can bounce back sharply in the latter part of the year if there is a resolution on tariff uncertainty. On Monday, at least, the broad index rose slightly as it tries to claw back its recent losses. The move came after the latest U.S. retail sales report showed consumers are still spending, though at a slower pace than expected.

A second major bank has cut its S&P 500 forecast on worries about economic growth,"RBC Capital Markets slashed its year-end outlook for the S & P 500 as concerns about economic growth continue to rattle investors. Lori Calvasina, the firm's head of equity strategy, said the broad index should now end 2025 at 6,200, which marks a decrease of 6.1% from its previous expectation of 6,600. Her new forecast also implies just a 5.4% advance from where the benchmark finished last year. Calvasina's call comes as investors contend with fears that economic growth is cooling after recent economic data and anecdotes raised red flags about consumer health. What's more, President Donald Trump's tariff policy has created uncertainty among traders and has thrown the market into a tailspin over the past three weeks. ""We had previously seen the [U.S.] equity market on a rocky path higher through year-end,"" Calvasina told clients in a Monday note. ""While we don't believe that a pullback beyond the 10% drawdown that has already been sustained is inevitable, we do believe that the path for stocks between now and December has gotten rockier with stronger headwinds."" Calvasina pointed out that sentiment across a range of stakeholders has recently soured. Be it investors or consumers or business owners, she said there are signs that their outlooks are turning more pessimistic, which can have a negative read-through for financial markets. .SPX 1Y mountain S & P 500- 1-year After the tariff-fueled rout seen recently, the S & P 500 is now down 3.7% year to date. The broad index has flirted with correction territory , which refers to a retreat of at least 10% from a recent high. That marks a turn from the strong market momentum seen over the past two years, with the S & P 500 hitting fresh all-time highs just last month. Taken all together, this landscape has resulted in what Calvasina described as a ""tricky moment"" for the U.S. equity market. ""The vibes have helped us understand why the stock market has been getting hit so hard, and why concerns about the direction of the economy are rising,"" she said. ""But the vibes aren't sending us a clear signal about whether, even with the S & P 500 down 10% from all time highs, a contrarian buying opportunity is at hand."" With the move, RBC joined Goldman Sachs in cutting its year-end S & P 500 target. Goldman also landed on a 6,200 estimate when revising its outlook last week.

""It has dawned on Wall Street (and us!) that President Trump's tariffs aren't negotiating chips to help the U.S. lower tariffs around the world, promoting free trade,"" Yardeni said in a note to clients Thursday.

The S & P 500 has fallen about 9% from its recent peak, teetering near correction territory. On Thursday, investors grappled with a fresh threat from the White House to impose 200% tariffs on all alcoholic products coming from the 27-nation European Union in retaliation for the bloc's 50% tariff on American whiskey. Yardeni said U.S. trade policy is disorganized. ""We can't ignore the potential stagflationary impact of the policies that Trump 2.0 is currently implementing haphazardly."" ""In response to the now heightened risk of stagflation, we are lowering our S & P 500 valuation expectations and year-end price targets,"" Yardeni said.

"BCA Research says DOGE and tariffs tipping economy into recession, downgrades stocks","Aggressive tariffs and federal spending cuts spearheaded by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency could tip the U.S. economy into a recession, according to BCA Research, which downgraded equities due to this negative backdrop. ""We think that the uncertainty engendered by DOGE and tariffs will provide the nudge to tip it into a recession and are tactically downgrading equities to underweight and upgrading fixed income and cash to overweight,"" BCA strategists led by chief U.S. investment strategist Doug Peta wrote in a note to clients. Stocks have already been under pressure as tariffs implemented by the Trump administration fuel fears of inflationary pressures and lower consumer spending.

The billionaire tech entrepreneur, with Trump's blessing, has reduced more than 60,000 federal headcounts , spanning 17 agencies, according to an estimate from Challenger.

"HSBC upgrades European stocks, downgrades U.S. as it rethinks Trump optimism","HSBC is rethinking the outlook for global equities amid rising macroeconomic concerns. The firm downgraded U.S. stocks to neutral in a Monday note and upgraded European equities. Global equity strategist Alastair Pinder noted that catalysts including tariffs and a changing view on NATO allies from President Donald Trump are stoking market volatility. The strategist's shift comes as U.S. stocks continued to sell off on Monday , bringing the S & P 500's losses over the past month to more than 6%. The Nasdaq Composite has tumbled more than 10% during that time, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed 4.6%. Investors around the world came into 2025 optimistic about U.S. stocks, as the incoming Trump administration was expected to curb regulation and lower taxes, ultimately driving corporate profits higher. However, equities have been under pressure given Trump's tariffs on Canadian, Chinese and Mexican imports, which have been key drivers for worry over economic growth. Investors are signaling concern that a recession in the U.S. is now more of a possibility, especially as some recent data has signaled cracking in both the labor market and overall economy. Meanwhile, Trump's economic policies and unwillingness to continue supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia are sparking a sense of resilience in Europe, Pinder noted. ""We started the year overweight emerging market equities on the assumption that tariff threats would drive bolder and bigger fiscal stimulus from China,"" he said. ""What we underestimated was how the U.S.'s wavering support for NATO and Ukraine would trigger a watershed moment for the eurozone — with Germany expected to also follow through with sizeable fiscal stimulus."" European stocks have outperformed their U.S. counterparts to start the year. The Stoxx 600 index has climbed 8% in 2025, while the S & P 500 is down more than 3%.

Pinder noted that he expects corporate earnings to remain intact, despite a ""complex"" backdrop of tariffs. The strategist also said he is not quite ready to forecast a longer-term negative view on U.S. equities because of tariffs.

"Watch for market correction in first half of this year, says Trivariate Research","A spate of weak economic data in recent weeks suggests the stock market is headed for a correction in the first six months of 2025, according to Trivariate Research. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% last week, marking their biggest one-week declines of the year. The S & P 500 also pulled back more than 1.5% during that period. Those losses were driven by new U.S. reports that pointed to a slowdown. Consumer sentiment missed estimates as inflation expectations rose. Purchasing manufacturing index figures from S & P Global, meanwhile, pointed to a contraction in the services sector for February. This led to a steep pullback in the U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which Trivariate founder Adam Parker highlighted as a stark warning sign for potential turbulence ahead. The index measures the totality of the difference between economic results and forecasts. Parker said the index's Friday reading ""was the lowest in a long time"" and ""perhaps a visible negative sign that policy uncertainties are starting to have a negative impact."" ""This past week, we think we are starting to see some more broad-based concern about a volatile backdrop,"" Parker wrote in a Sunday note. ""We would take risk cautiously in the coming weeks until we have more certainty, and we reiterate our conclusion from the outlook,"" which calls for a correction in the first half of the year. A correction is typically defined by a 10% pullback from a recent closing high. In the S & P 500's case, that would be the record close of 6,144.15 set Wednesday. The benchmark on Monday traded about 2% below that level. .SPX YTD mountain SPX year to date Parker opined last month that investors were somewhat overlooking the negative implications that U.S. tariffs on imports could have on the economy and corporate earnings. Recent market moves have done little to deter Parker from diverging from his forecast. ""Many of the 'word salad' prognosticators who were cautious the last two years now like U.S. equities and small caps. That's worrisome,"" Parker's said in his outlook. ""Given the market run, we think it is likely the market will correct in the first half of 2025. Our judgment is that the risks are skewed toward the downside for the S & P500 in the first half of the year."" ""We think investors have too benign of an interpretation of potential new policies and their impact on U.S. earnings,"" Parker added. Moving forward, Parker suggests investors opt for health care and industrial stocks, while remaining underweight in consumer discretionary stocks. The S & P 500 health care sector is the best performer year to date, up more than 7%, led by gains in CVS Health and Gilead Sciences . Industrials have gained 2%, with Uber Technologies and GE Aerospace outperforming.

European stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts — but for how long?,"European stock markets have been on a tear this year, brushing off tariff threats , political volatility and economic stagnation — and strategists see significant upside ahead, even if a long-awaited annual outperformance over their U.S. peers remains elusive. In January, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index notched its best outperformance against the S & P 500 for that month in the past decade, rising by 6.3% versus 2.7%. That momentum has continued into February, with the Stoxx 600's 3.3% monthly gain as of Feb. 18 coming in well above the S & P 500's 1.25%. This bullishness around Europe may appear surprising on some levels. U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House has been described as fueling U.S. business optimism , while the euro area's biggest economies — Germany and France — are both mired with political instabilities. U.S. economic growth also remains well ahead of the U.K. and euro zone's. And it would not be the first year that European markets have kicked off the year strongly before stumbling behind the U.S. on an annual basis (excluding 2022 when its losses were shallower, the Stoxx 600 has not delivered a better performance than the S & P 500 for a decade). However, the U.S. is now grappling with tariff-related inflation concerns , while central bankers in Europe have largely downplayed the risk of a knock-on impact on prices in their own countries. The Bank of England, European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank are all expected to keep cutting interest rates early this year, while the Federal Reserve treads water . ""The market is getting a little bit more concerned about stagflation in the U.S. ... that policy uncertainty in the U.S. is perhaps one of the reasons why there's been quite a lot of demand to diversify away from the U.S.,"" Gerry Fowler, head of European equity strategy at UBS, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" last week. Fowler noted that the U.S. accounts for more than 70% of global equity market capitalization, meaning it doesn't require a lot of money to move from the U.S. elsewhere to have a ""fairly big"" impact. ""That's what we've seen in Europe. We've seen hedge funds in particular buying,"" he added. But Fowler and others have also identified a range of factors supporting Europe, leading UBS to upgrade Europe relative to the U.S. ""We believe Europe can outperform U.S., near term,"" UBS Investment Bank said in a note. These factors include the potential for a ceasefire in Ukraine — a possibility this year as Trump pushes for controversial peace talks , — a stronger economy in France, which has finally passed its contentious 2025 budget — and for fiscal expansion in Germany following this weekend's election. Goldman Sachs strategists led by Sharon Bell last week also raised their potential upside for Europe based on the odds of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, citing benefits including ""lower risk premium, lower energy prices, better consumer confidence, stronger economic growth."" 'Enjoy it while it lasts' Positive earnings revisions have also been one of the drivers of European equity strength this year, Citi strategists said in a note Tuesday. European revision trends look ""more impressive than in the U.S."" while ""upwards revisions have been meaningfully stronger than seasonal patterns would predict,"" they wrote. When this has happened to the same level before, European earnings have outpaced the U.S. by around 5% on average over the next six months, the bank said, and the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index has kept pace with U.S. equities over the same period. ""The latest [Earnings Revisions Indices] readings, if they continue, could be a lead on actual [earnings per share] being upgraded, while providing a potential tailwind for further European equity market gain,"" the strategists added. Citi's global equity strategist, David Groman, told CNBC last month that the bank was still overweight on the U.S. in its global allocation, but that Europe was its ""favorite diversifier in the cyclical, rest of world space. ""One of the reasons for that is we are maybe moving past what was peak bearishness on Europe,"" he continued. UBS's Gerry Fowler said that if Europe does continue to outperform, it won't just be driven by European upside but also by U.S. vulnerability, particularly regarding the Magnificent 7 stocks . These seven U.S. tech giants accounted for over half of the S & P 500's gain in 2024, but many have come under pressure this year. Automaker Tesla's revenue missed expectations in the fourth quarter, for instance, while chip giant Nvidia has been rattled by China's AI startup DeepSeek . ""There's certainly plenty of momentum and enthusiasm in Europe that I don't think has been fully backed by regional allocators with large amounts of money, that are generally neutral to underweight Europe ... and typically heavily overweight or at least neutral in the U.S.,"" Fowler added. Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, took a more downbeat view on the recent outperformance in Europe, however. ""I think at least European investors may need to enjoy it while it lasts,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" last week. While Europe's fourth-quarter earnings season was a good one, positive earnings surprises have been stronger in the U.S. than in Europe, Morris said. ""So if, fundamentally, earnings are what drive equity markets, you just don't see the same momentum. If you look at earnings revisions, again, more supportive for the U.S. If you do get tariffs, that's better for the U.S.,"" he said, adding that the recent outperformance could be because European stocks were starting from a lower base. ""If you look at the economic data that was released last week, almost all of it disappointed in Europe. So it doesn't really feel like — even with this [recent] performance in the market — that we're at a turning point."" — CNBC's Ganesh Rao contributed to this story.

These moves coupled with recent trading action have made several observers concerned that the market will only get worse before it gets better. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, is incorporating expectations of a 5% to 10% pullback into her S & P 500 target for the year. She expects the broad market index could end the year at 6,600 — a 13% move up from Friday's close — so long as it can get past any near-term choppiness. At risk ""[We were] very clear with the 6,600 that we expected a 5% to 10% pullback to materialize early in the year,"" Calvasina told CNBC "" Squawk Box "" on Monday. ""[If] we get something beyond 10%, I think that target is at risk, but I think we can withstand a 5% to 10% type move."" ""And, you know, the last few days, it looks like that's right where we're headed,"" Calvasina added. ""We're pretty close to that 5%."" Utilities would likely serve as a defensive safe harbor in the event of a drawdown of that size, she said, noting she's overweight the group. .SPX 6M mountain S & P 500 over past six months Javed Mirza, quantitative and technical analyst at Raymond James, said the price charts point to ""an intermediate-term (1-3 month) corrective phase [that's] taking hold on most North American equity indices,"" including sell signals he said were triggered in the S & P 500 and Russell 2000. Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, recently wrote that ""we're due for one,"" referring to a correction, typically defined as a decline of 10% or more from a high . Hackett added that such pullbacks are a healthy part of a market cycle, and typically occur every 18 months. Troublesome signs A number of signs in the market have made investors wary lately. The mega-cap tech leaders that shouldered the market last year have buckled, with Nvidia and Apple more than 10% off their recent highs, and the fourth quarter rally failed to broaden out to include other sectors and groups. On Monday, the 10 -year Treasury yield — used to price mortgages, credit cards and auto loans — touched its highest level going back to November 2023 , heading toward the key 5% level that could further pressure an already fragile market. The benchmark yield was last trading around 4.77% late Monday. US10Y 5D mountain U.S. 10-year Treasury yield To be sure, most strategists are confident the longer-term trend for markets remain bullish, saying the recent slide is a natural reaction to last year's exuberance. They say a strong fundamental story, in the form of everything Artificial Intelligence-related, and the strength of the Magnificent Seven stocks (Apple, Microsoft , Nvidia, Amazon , Tesla , Meta and Alphabet ), can still support the S & P 500. ""We don't anticipate a protracted downturn,"" Nationwide's Hackett wrote. ""This is a textbook case of the market getting ahead of itself and self-correcting — healthy, expected and ultimately constructive for long-term market stability."" According to RBC's Calvasina, the outlook for stocks will finally rest on the strength of the upcoming earnings season, as well as the path forward for inflation.",2025-01-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/more-strategists-are-bracing-for-a-10percent-market-correction.html,cnbc
"Evercore ISI sees more S&P 500 gains next year on Trump and a bull case of 7,400","Evercore ISI believes President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business policies could drive the stock market to new heights next year, predicting the S & P 500 will climb more than 20% in its most optimistic bull case. The investment firm sees ""momentum with positive business sentiment around Trump, more volatility like 2018 and typical of the year following two 'Roaring 20%+' return years as valuations [are] extended, sensitive to policy and geopolitical news flow,"" senior managing director Julian Emanuel said in a note to clients. The firm set its base case for the end of 2025 at an S & P 500 level of 6,800, which would still represent a 12% gain from Friday's close of 6,051. For its bull case, however, Evercore sees the equity benchmark soaring to 7,400, a near 23% gain from current prices. For its bear case, the firm sees the S & P 500 falling to 5,200, largely owing to concerns around higher bond yields, stubborn inflation and muted economic growth resulting in stagflation. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500 Evercore's target is higher than the average forecast among top Wall Street strategists, which stands at 6,630 for 2025, equivalent to about a 10% gain next year, according to CNBC Pro's Market Strategist Survey. (Pro subscribers can track the strategist survey throughout the year here as the forecasters update their outlooks.) The S & P 500 appears set to wrap up a strong 2024 with gains, due to optimism toward Trump's market-friendly policies coupled with easing inflation and lower interest rates. The benchmark is up 27.2%, excluding reinvested dividends, on track for its best year since 2019. Emanuel said this bull cycle still has room to run despite stretched valuations, but investors should expect heightened volatility in the Trump administration. The ""current Bull Market is young in terms of time and total return; [but] returns [are] well below those of prior 'expensive' periods,"" Emanuel said. ""Higher volatility though, like Trump's 2018, is [the] base case given Changes in Policy, Geopolitical Dynamics and Asset Price sensitivity to developments with an historically expensive market valuation."" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2024-12-16 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/evercore-isi-sees-more-sp-500-gains-next-year-on-trump-and-a-bull-case-of-7400.html,cnbc
Who got it right and wrong on Wall Street in their 2024 stock market outlook,"This year, Wall Street extended its artificial intelligence-powered bull market into a second year, far surpassing the year-end forecasts made by top strategists. In fact, all of them turned out to be very wrong. Original 2024 outlooks for the S & P 500 ranged from a low of just 4,200 at JPMorgan by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, to a high of 5,200 from Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus. The S & P 500 closed Thursday at 6,051.25, more than 800 points above the highest forecast at the start of the year. The year-to-date gain stands at 27%. Several factors caught most of the Street off guard. First, many strategists expected a recession to take hold of the U.S. economy in 2024. That did not happen. Instead, the economy kept growing at a steady pace, and the labor market continued expanding, all while inflation trended down toward the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Second, the Fed was able to start cutting rates despite the consistent economic growth. The central bank began its rate-cutting campaign with a bang in September, lowering fed funds by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point. Third, Donald Trump's return to the White House fueled market euphoria, as investors bet on deregulation and lower taxes. These all combined to push stocks to dozens of new all-time highs this year. With less than a month left to trade, the S & P 500 is ahead 26.9%, and that does not even include dividends. As a result, strategists have updated their outlooks throughout 2024 to reflect the altered conditions. The highest now is 6,200, also from Oppenheimer, suggesting another 2.5% upside from current levels. JPMorgan has kept its original target, on paper at least, making it still the lowest forecast on Wall Street. Barring a December cataclysm, strategists from Evercore ISI, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Wells Fargo Investment Institute were also proven too bearish this year. Evercore ISI senior managing director Julian Emanuel and Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin had original year-end targets of 4,750 and 4,700, respectively, although both have since updated their forecasts to 6,000. Goldman's team actually raised its 2024 forecast to 5,100 before the new year even began , after stocks took off heading into the end of 2023. Wells Fargo's target also started the year at 4,700, while UBS originally forecast a 4,940 year-end level for the S & P 500. Both still have targets below 6,000. Bank of America's Savita Subramanian originally had a year-end target of 5,000 for the S & P 500, which closed 2023 at about 4,770. She raised it to 5,400 in early March , which at the time suggested about 5% upside, and most recently hiked it to 6,000 on Nov. 15, saying the broad market index is ""statistically expensive on almost every metric"" but higher quality, less leveraged and more ""asset-light"" than prior decades. Looking ahead, several strategists have already released their 2025 outlooks and think there is plenty of room for U.S. stocks to run.

"Here's where the stock market is headed in 2025, according to Wall Street's top strategists","Wall Street is out with its 2025 outlook, and while strategists are broadly optimistic stocks can still go higher, they are also anticipating a turbulent market in the year ahead. The S & P 500 is expected to end next year at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey released Friday. That level represents about a 9.6% advance from where the S & P 500 closed Thursday, in line with the historical returns of any given year for the broad market. On a median basis, the S & P 500 is expected to end 2025 at 6,600, the survey found, also a 9% gain. Here are the current 2025 targets from top strategists: Maximum target: 7,100 — John Stoltzfus, Oppenheimer Minimum target: 6,400 — Jonathan Golub, UBS Average target: 6,630 Median Target: 6,600 (Pro subscribers can track the strategist survey throughout the year here as the forecasters update their outlooks.) Investors fully expect the bull market to continue in 2025, but they are mindful that the rally will hardly be as rewarding in its third year after the monster gains of the first two. The S & P 500 surged 27% in 2024 after climbing 24% in 2023. ""There are strong tailwinds supportive of stocks in 2025,"" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in his outlook. ""But we see this as a tale of 'two years.'"" Lee, who expects the S & P 500 will close out 2025 at 6,600 after reaching 7,000 halfway through, noted stocks historically do worse in the second half of year three of a bull market. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500 Still, no strategist surveyed expects the market will end next year lower than it is now, which is different from the start of this year when recession fears resulted in some very bearish forecasts. The highest target identified on the 2025 survey is from Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus, whose 7,100 objective implies a 17% move higher from Thursday's close. The lowest target is from UBS' Jonathan Golub, who expects the S & P 500 will rise to 6,400, representing about a 5% gain. Predicting where the market might land in a year's time can be a tough task. Last year, strategists, on average, expected the S & P 500 would end 2024 at 5,705, which the index first surpassed in September. (Read here for more on how strategists did this year.) Strong economic activity There is a lot to be positive about in today's market, according to Wall Street. A strong macroeconomic picture, as reflected in a broadening out of the market's winners, is underpinning a robust earnings growth outlook next year that has many strategists expecting the bull run to continue. What's more, an easing interest rate outlook and President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business policies are thought to be additional positives for the market, especially for cyclical assets most closely tied to economic fortunes. Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said his expectation of roughly 11% earnings growth in 2025 is behind a year-end S & P 500 forecast of 7,000. He expects strong corporate activity, including a rise in buybacks and spending on mergers and acquisitions, will also bolster the stock market. ""A key reason for staying constructive is, really, being constructive on the [business cycle],"" Chadha told CNBC. ""The broadening of the market from the market lows on Oct. 27, 2023 along with ongoing rebalancing and rotation among sectors, market capitalizations (large, mid and small stocks), style (growth and value) and cyclicals and defensives suggest to us that the current bull market likely has legs strong enough to climb the proverbial 'wall of worry' into and through 2025,"" Oppenheimer's Stoltzfus wrote in his outlook . The other bullish driver behind markets is spending on artificial intelligence and profits resulting from AI innovations, which can start to boost other sectors once megacap tech stocks start to ""share center stage"" with the broader market, Stoltzfus argued. What they're worried about But that does not mean there aren't some glaring challenges either, with tariffs top of mind as a No. 1 risk for many strategists, which they fear will prove inflationary. Trump has threatened tariffs of 60% or more on Chinese goods, and has vowed to impose 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada. That danger does not bother other strategists, who expect that Trump's deregulatory efforts will offset any harm from tariffs. ""At this point we still do not have sufficient Trump policy information to build into our fundamental framework with any confidence,"" Citigroup's Scott Chronert wrote in his outlook . ""Previous work showed that tariffs are likely to create a drag to earnings. However, we need to allow for both uncertainty and opportunity. Our instinct is that policy effects will ultimately prove only marginal to consensus."" ""If it's a question of whether the tariffs and the trade war basically disrupt the business cycle, our working view is that they won't,"" Deutsche Bank's Chadha said. One key concern for investors is how expensive the market is, which has some strategists seeking returns outside the S & P 500. Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity and strategy, prefers the S & P Equal Weight Index rather than the traditional S & P 500, which is ranked by each company's market capitalization. She noted that the market cap index is expected to spit out returns in the ""low single digits"" over the next decade, while gains in the equal-weight index jump to 5% to 6% per year. ""A lot of clients are worried about buying the S & P today, given how lofty its valuation is, and our counter argument is, well, if you look at the average S & P 500 company, it's trading at a massive discount to the index, and actually bodes well for returns,"" Subramanian told CNBC. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs' David Kostin expects the S & P 500 to end next year at 6,500 , as does Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson . BMO Capital's Brian Belski sees a rise to 6,700, and UBS is forecasting 6,400 by this time next year.",2024-12-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/heres-the-2025-forecast-for-the-sp-500-from-wall-streets-top-strategists.html,cnbc
Stifel says a 10% to 15% S&P 500 correction is coming because of sticky inflation,"Stocks could be in store for a correction in 2025 as inflation remains persistently above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, according to Stifel Financial. The investment bank forecast that the S & P 500 index will fall to the mid 5,000 support level in the middle of next year, equal to a 10% to 15% correction, after peaking in the first half of the year, according to chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. The firm cited stubborn price pressures alongside sluggish growth in gross domestic product as key catalysts for its S & P 500 forecast, with Bannister seeing real U.S. GDP slowing to about 1.5% by the middle of 2025. ""All this occurs at a time when stock valuations and Growth vs. Value are at extremes, since every generation has a bubble mentality (inflation adjusted S & P 500 peaks 1929, 1968, 2000), this being ours,"" Bannister wrote in a 71-page report on Thursday. ""The environment does not appear conducive to continued equity mania, and we prefer more defensive sectors (e.g., Healthcare, Utilities, Staples),"" he added. The strategist also said he expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the central bank's Jan. 29 policy meeting, keeping the overnight borrowing rate at 4.00% to 4.25%. He forecast two more rate reductions in 2025 before the Fed ultimately concludes cutting rates in the second half of 2025. Bannister's forecast comes as stocks have lately cooled in response to a lack of progress in bringing inflation down further. November producer prices came in above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, while consumer prices on Wednesday matched economists' forecasts. As of Thursday, Fed funds futures trading data is pricing in a 98% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates a quarter-percentage point at its policy meeting next week.

The strategist, who has gained a following in recent years for his timely market calls and general optimism about stocks, released his new outlook for 2025 on Wednesday. Lee projects the S & P 500 rallying about 16% from here to 7,000 by the middle of 2025. However, Lee then sees the index retreating to 6,600 by the end of the year. That would make for a full-year gain of roughly 9.4%. ""There are strong tailwinds supportive of stocks in 2025. But we see this as a tale of 'two years,'"" Lee said. The factors supporting further gains are a pair of ""puts"" from the Federal Reserve and the incoming Trump administration, Lee said. The Fed can focus more on supporting employment as inflation eases, while the Trump administration could implement policies to boost earnings growth, Lee said. A market ""put"" is a Wall Street shorthand for saying that a factor can help create a floor of support for stocks. .SPX YTD mountain The S & P 500 has gained more than 26% this year, breaking above the 6,000 level. Historical patterns are the reason for the projected second-half swoon. The S & P 500 is up more than 26% in 2024, its second-straight year with a gain of more than 20%. History shows that such rallies struggle during the third year, according to Lee. ""5 of 5 precedents saw stocks do worse in second half of year 3,"" the Fundstrat outlook said. The new Trump administration does bring some potential negatives for the stock market. Tariffs are the No. 1 risk for 2025, Lee said, and there is also a chance that the push for more government efficiency could lead to economically damaging spending cuts. Lee has also been a long-term bull on bitcoin . He said in his note that the leading cryptocurrency has ""upside to $250,000"" next year. Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time last week. Fundstrat and Lee gained prominence in 2020, when he correctly called for a rebound rally after the pandemic-related sell-off early that year.

Investors would have been better off buying Berkshire Hathaway shares than Mag 7 to start 2024,"The Magnificent 7 tech magacaps fueled the AI-powered bull market, but lately Warren Buffett's old-economy conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is coming out on top. The CNBC Magnificent 7 Index, consisting of Apple , Alphabet , Nvidia , Microsoft , Tesla , Meta and Amazon , is up 43.4% since the beginning of 2024. Berkshire has handily beaten the tech group by three percentage points, climbing 46.3% gain during the same period. ""Believe it or not, you would have been better off buying BRK/B than the Mag 7 to start '24,"" Chris Verrone, Strategas head of technical and macro research, said in a note to clients, referring to Berkshire's Class B stock. That's largely due to Mag 7's dramatic pullback in the new year, falling 13%. Technology stocks have come under pressure as economic uncertainty surged in the first two months of the Trump administration, driven by the impact of higher tariffs and concern about soaring investment in artificial intelligence. All seven stocks are lower in 2025. Berkshire, meanwhile, has rallied more than 15% in 2025, hitting several record highs along the way. The underperformance of the Mag 7 indicates a shift in market leadership, at least for now, as the questionable macroeconomic environment dents risk appetite, driving investors to safer corners of the market. Berkshire fits the bill given the the defensive nature of its huge Geico insurance empire and its unmatched balance sheet boasting hundreds of billions in cash. Tesla is the biggest loser in the Mag 7, tumbling nearly 50% just since its record high in December. Even Microsoft, the outperformer in the group, is down 13% from its recent peak. Apple, in which Berkshire still owns a large position, has sold off 14% this year. Coincidentally, the 94-year-old investment legend has slashed his Apple stake by two thirds over the past year, last reporting owning 300 million shares at the end of 2024. That's spared Berkshire billions of dollars in investment losses.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire may sell its real estate brokerage business. What it means,"Reports that Berkshire Hathaway may soon sell its real-estate brokerage business sparked speculation that Warren Buffett may have lost faith in the struggling industry. Compass is in advanced talks to buy Berkshire's HomeServices of America , and a deal could come together soon, the Wall Street Journal said Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. HomeServices CEO Gino Blefari sent out a note to employees after the WSJ report, saying no such sale is under consideration. Still, the news of a potential sale sent a signal that perhaps the 94-year-old Buffett, the ultimate buy-and-hold investor, has soured on a real estate industry plagued by low sales, limited inventory and stubbornly high prices. ""He won't sell unless he sees a continued drain. He sold the [news]papers when he saw no future without consolidation,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. Throwing in the towel When Buffett invested in newspapers including the Omaha World-Herald and Buffalo News in the 1970s, he thought their franchises were impregnable. But by the early 2000s his view on the industry darkened as shrinking advertising revenue and the transition to digital platforms destroyed profits. He eventually sold his 30-odd newspapers in early 2020. ""We're more reluctant to sell them than most people,"" Buffett at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2009. ""If we made the right decision going in, we like to ride that a very long time... But if the competitive advantage disappears, if we really lose faith in the management, if we were wrong in the original analysis — and that happens — we sell."" Now, maybe the same sort of throwing in the towel is coming for real estate services. HomeServices was absorbed by Berkshire in a 1999 deal to buy utility giant MidAmerican Energy, which then owned the real estate broker. As a result of that history, HomeServices, now an umbrella business for 48 brand names and 37,700 real estate agents, has operated as a subsidiary under Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). Slowdown signs HomeServices remains a miniscule part of Buffett's conglomerate, generating $4.4 billion in revenue in 2024, compared to $26.3 billion in revenue for BHE and $371.4 billion for Berkshire as a whole. Still, recent years have brought clear signs of a slowdown at HomeServices. The unit suffered a net loss of $113 million in 2024, reversing a $13 million profit in 2023 and $100 million in net earnings in 2022. Berkshire attributed the profit slump to charges in connection with ongoing real estate industry litigation. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to pay $250 million to settle lawsuits nationwide claiming that longstanding practices by real estate brokerages forced U.S. homeowners to pay artificially inflated brokerage commissions when selling their homes. Additionally, Buffett noted in the 2024 Berkshire annual report that the real estate brokerage business continues to be hurt ""by the availability of homes for sale and high home prices."" Business tied to U.S. housing continues to soften as potential buyers face higher mortgage rates, elevated prices and a limited number of new listings.

Bank of America snub by Warren Buffett in his annual report raises eyebrows,"Bank of America is still one of Berkshire Hathaway 's top equity holdings, but a curious omission from Warren Buffett in his annual report caught the attention of at least one bank analyst. Barclays' Jason Goldberg pointed to a specific quote by the ""Oracle of Omaha"" in Berkshire's 10K released on Saturday : ""We own a small percentage of a dozen or so very large and highly profitable businesses with household names such as Apple , American Express , Coca-Cola and Moody's ."" The bank analyst argued that failing to mention Bank of America seemed odd given the size and scope of the American lender, originally founded in San Francisco in 1904. ""One could wonder, if BAC was still in his top five, perhaps he would have mentioned it,"" Goldberg said in a note. ""With 69 [million] U.S. consumer and small business clients as well as 3,700 financial centers and 15,000 ATMs across the U.S., it's hard to argue BAC is not a household name (certainly more so than Moody's)."" This observation came after Berkshire reduced its Bank of America position to about 680 million shares at the end of 2024 from roughly one billion shares in the second quarter. The sales put downward pressure on the stock even as the bank's latest earnings topped expectations thanks to better-than-expected investment banking and interest income. The conglomerate's stake has now dipped below the important 700 million share threshold, which is the number of shares Berkshire acquired through low-priced warrants more than a decade ago. BAC 1Y mountain Bank of America over the past year Buffett originally acquired his massive BofA stake in two stages. He famously bought $5 billion of preferred stock and warrants in 2011 to shore up confidence in the embattled lender in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis , and later converted the warrants to common stock in 2017. After getting the Federal Reserve's approval to raise the holding above 10%, Buffett bought 300 million additional shares in the open market in 2018 and 2019. The first 700 million shares had a cost basis of only about $7 per share, while the average cost of the next 300 million shares was in the $30s, Goldberg previously estimated. The theory was that Berkshire would stop selling once it got to 700 million shares due to tax implications, but that proved untrue.",2025-02-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/bank-of-america-snub-by-buffett-in-his-annual-report-raises-eyebrows.html,cnbc
"Highlights of Warren Buffett's annual letter: Advice for Trump, 60 years at Berkshire helm","Legendary investor Warren Buffett opined on a wide range of topics in his much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders, including the U.S.' worsening fiscal problems, advice for the Trump administration as well as his 60-year career at Berkshire Hathaway . Here are the best highlights from Buffett's 2024 annual letter: The ""Oracle of Omaha"" revealed that Berkshire last year paid $26.8 billion in taxes, about 5% of what all of corporate America paid. He urged the current administration to spend taxpayers' money wisely and maintain a stable currency. So thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at Berkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in 2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part. Buffett also brought attention to the country's spiraling fiscal problems. The budget deficit topped $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2024, with interest expense topping $1 trillion for the first time ever due to high long-term yields. Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency. The 94-year-old Berkshire CEO stressed that he still prefers owning equities to cash despite his recent aggressive stock-selling spree. The Omaha-based conglomerate net sold equities for a ninth consecutive quarter in the final period of last year, while amassing a record cash pile of $334 billion . Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won't change. Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned. In this year's letter , Buffett endorsed designated successor Greg Abel in his ability to pick equity opportunities, even comparing him to the late Charlie Munger. He added that Abel will carry on the tradition of writing annual letters when Buffett is no longer at the helm. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie. At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a ""report"" is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well. Reflecting on his admirable career of more than 60 years at Berkshire, Buffett pointed out a few crucially winning decisions that helped transform the conglomerate, including acquiring auto insurer Geico and hiring Ajit Jain to oversee its insurance business. I've also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as the ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single winning decision can make a breathtaking difference over time. (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a managerial decision and my luck in finding Charlie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal advisor and steadfast friend.) Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom. The famed value investor noted that Berkshire will be a long-term investor in the five Japanese trading houses he began buying nearly six years go. He revealed that Berkshire has reached an agreement with the companies to own beyond the initial 10% ceiling. Our holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed to supporting their boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire's holdings below 10% of each company's shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling. Over time, you will likely see Berkshire's ownership of all five increase somewhat.",2025-02-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/22/highlights-of-warren-buffetts-annual-letter-advice-for-trump-60-years-at-berkshire-helm.html,cnbc
Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake stays at 300 million shares for a second straight quarter,"Berkshire Hathaway's highly scrutinized Apple stake has been held steady for two straight quarters, after dumping two-thirds of the shares in a head-turning selling spree last year. Warren Buffett's conglomerate owned 300 million shares of Apple at the end of 2024, the same amount it had at the end of the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing. The iPhone maker remains the largest stock stake by far for Berkshire despite the recent sales. Berkshire had slashed its big Apple stake for four quarters in a row. Back in the third quarter of 2023, the Omaha-based giant held 915.6 million shares of the tech stock. At Berkshire's annual meeting last year, Buffett noted that selling ""a little Apple"" would benefit Berkshire shareholders in the long run — if the tax on capital gains is raised down the road by a U.S. government wanting to plug a climbing fiscal deficit. However, the magnitude of the selling made many believe it was more than just a tax-saving move. Some speculated that Buffett was concerned about high market valuation, while others thought it was part of portfolio management as the Apple stake once took up more than half of Berkshire's portfolio. Investors will look to Buffett's annual letter, to be released Saturday morning along with Berkshire's quarterly earnings, for commentary about Apple as well as the broader market. Overall, Buffett has been in selling mode, with sales exceeding stock purchases for nine consecutive quarters, according to Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan, who covers Berkshire. Berkshire's monstrous cash pile topped a record $300 billion in the third quarter of 2024 as a result. ""Solid free-cash-flow generation has contributed to the increase, but stock sales have had a far greater impact,"" Shanahan said in a note.",2025-02-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/berkshire-hathaways-apple-stake-stays-at-300-million-shares-for-a-second-straight-quarter.html,cnbc
Analysts speculate selling by Buffett could be behind recent Bank of America weakness,"Bank of America has lagged its peers since the lender's stellar fourth-quarter earnings report, leading some analysts to speculate that Berkshire Hathaway , the biggest investor in the nation's second-largest bank, has been quietly offloading shares again. Since its latest quarterly report on Jan. 16, Bank of America shares are little changed, compared to a 2% gain for the S & P 500 and a 4% advance for SPDR S & P Bank ETF (KBE) over the same span. The underperformance is even more notable since Bank of America posted results that topped expectations thanks to better-than-expected investment banking and interest income. Fourth-quarter profit more than doubled to $6.67 billion, or 82 cents per share, from a year earlier. Closely-watch net interest income rose 3% to $14.5 billion, topping estimates by about $170 million. BAC KBE 1M mountain Bank of America has lagged a leading bank ETF over the past month Two Wall Street analysts believe that the weak performance is due to continued selling pressure from Warren Buffett's conglomerate. ""Is Warren in the room with us now?"" Truist Securities' John McDonald asked in a note to clients. ""Some investors are questioning whether part of the post-4Q underperformance is selling pressure from Berkshire Hathaway,"" after large sales in the second half of 2024, he said. Reducing the stake Last year, Omaha-based Berkshire began a selling spree in what had once been its second-biggest stock holding behind Apple . Berkshire ultimately reduced its stake to below 10%, at which point it was no longer required to report what are known as ""related transactions"" in a timely manner. Wolfe Research's Steven Chubak said the recent price action in BofA ""strongly indicates"" that Berkshire has continued to reduce its position. ""While it's still too soon to give the all clear, we sense investors are growing more comfortable handicapping this technical overhang, and would look to lean in gradually as we are confident the stock will inflect [and the ] valuation gap will narrow, but [are] less certain on timing,"" Chubak said in a note. Investors will get a clearer picture when Berkshire releases its 13F filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, which will show its stock market holdings as of the end of 2024. Buffett's widely-read annual letter to shareholders, to be released at the end of this month, might also reveal what the latest thinking is by the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" on the markets in general and Bank of America in particular. Chubak estimated that Berkshire's next 13F could show a leaner position of about 7% at the end of 2024, and guesses the holding today might be closer to 5.5% or 6%. Buffett famously bought $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock and warrants in 2011 to shore up confidence in the embattled lender in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. He converted the warrants to common stock in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in the bank. Buffett then added 300 million more shares to his investment in 2018 and 2019. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2025-02-09 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/09/buffett-may-have-resumed-selling-bank-of-america-shares-again-.html,cnbc
"UBS says Berkshire is well positioned for an uncertain economy in 2025, sees shares rising another 17%","Berkshire Hathaway shares should be a solid investment whether the economy flourishes or deteriorates in 2025, according to UBS, which projected a nearly 17% gain for the stock. Analyst Brian Meredith at the Wall Street investment bank believes the Warren Buffett conglomerate is poised to benefit from economic growth because of its cyclical businesses, including the BNSF Railway and manufacturing interests. But if the economy worsens, the stock could serve as a hedge due to the defensive nature of its huge insurance empire and Berkshire's unmatched balance sheet boasting hundreds of billions in cash, he said. ""Many of its Manufacturing, Services and Retail businesses, as well as BNSF, are economically sensitive and should perform well in a good economy,"" Meredith wrote in a note to clients. ""On the other hand, if the economy deteriorates and/or the market corrects, BRK's Insurance businesses are defensive, and its substantial cash position gives BRK a lot of firepower for potential accretive acquisitions and share buyback,"" he said.

The analyst hiked his 12-month price target on Berkshire Class B shares to $536 from $531, implying almost 17% upside from Thursday's close of $459.83. The shares outperformed the S & P 500 in 2024, scoring a 25.5% gain, its best year since 2021. The strong performance came even as the 94-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" stopped buying back Berkshire stock as shares grew ever more expensive. Instead, the conglomerate relied on solid operating earnings this past year, supported by strong investment income and underwriting earnings at auto insurer Geico. UBS believes Geico, Berkshire's insurance crown jewel, should see solid growth in 2025 as it adds to the number of policies outstanding following a slowdown. ""2025 should be the year where GEICO pivots to growth after shrinking policy count for the last several years,"" Meredith said. ""With rates adequate in most states and the system upgrade almost complete, we are beginning to see GEICO increase ad spend and file for rate decreases in some states."" The Wall Street bank said it's unlikely Berkshire will resume buybacks in a significant way given the stock's elevated valuation. The shares are currently trading at a 1% premium to the conglomerate's intrinsic value, UBS estimated. When Berkshire bought back a record amount of stock in 2020 and 2021, the stock was selling at a more than 20% discount to its intrinsic value, UBS said.",2025-01-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/26/ubs-sees-berkshire-shares-rising-another-17percent-in-2025.html,cnbc
Berkshire Hathaway hasn't paid a dividend in nearly 60 years — Could that ever change?,"Warren Buffett has made it known for decades that issuing dividends is out of the question for Berkshire Hathaway , but there's a chance it could be put back on the table when he's no longer at the helm. The Omaha-based conglomerate hasn't paid a dividend since 1967, two years after Buffett took control of the failing clothing maker. He later called that payment a one-off, ""terrible mistake."" The 94-year-old investment legend and his shareholders have always been confident that there are other, more profitable ways to deploy capital than by cutting quarterly checks to shareholders. Buffett has long said he would prefer stock buybacks to dividends as a way to return capital to shareholders, as scheduled cash payments have the implicit promise that they won't ever be reduced, let alone halted. ""Dividends have the implied promise that you keep paying them forever and not decrease them,"" whereas repurchasing Berkshire's own stock is often even more beneficial for shareholders, Buffett said in a 2018 interview with CNBC. Of the two, ""we would probably lean toward repurchase,"" he said. Buffett has also ruled out the possibility of a special, one-time dividend. 'A trick question' For a long time, shareholders assumed Berkshire would keep the policy on dividends when Buffett steps down or dies, leading to an eventual succession. But in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal , Warren Buffett's middle child Howard, who will eventually become Berkshire's nonexecutive chairman, hesitated when asked about Berkshire's future dividend policy. The younger Buffett was described as laughing and then replying, ""That's a trick question…There's no way that I can answer that question because I don't know."" Perhaps the elder Buffett has softened his opinion on dividends as Berkshire's cash pile continued to smash records. At $325 billion, Berkshire's cash hoard now accounts for about 30% of the conglomerate's total assets, the highest percentage since 1990. Berkshire hasn't done many deals in recent years. The last big acquisition Berkshire made was buying insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion in 2022. Before that, it was 2016 when the conglomerate bought industrial company Precision Castparts for $37 billion, including debt. Buffett has been parking his cash in Treasury bills and notes over the past few years, earning sizable returns. At the same time, he's shown frustration with how pricey the stock market has become, making attractive targets far and few in between. ""I think they expect us to do whatever we think makes sense for all shareholders,"" Buffett said in 2023's annual meeting. ""And obviously, if we really thought we never could use the money effectively in the business, we should get it out, one way or another."" Think differently The CEO has admitted he's changed his mind about his succession plan, noting that his decision is now influenced by how much Berkshire's assets have grown. Buffett told shareholders last year that his designated successor Greg Abel will have the final say on Berkshire's investment decisions, be it buying businesses or stocks. Many viewed that as a twist in his succession plan. ""I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,"" Buffett said last year. ""The sums have grown so large at Berkshire, and we do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.""",2025-01-19 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/19/berkshire-hasnt-paid-a-dividend-in-60-years-could-that-ever-change.html,cnbc
Wall Street analysts see big gains for these Warren Buffett-owned stocks in 2025,"Wall Street analysts see big gains in the new year for many of the stocks owned by none other than Warren Buffett.

Berkshire may need the help in 2025 after coming off a stellar 2024, when its Class A shares rallied 25.5%, topping the S & P 500 return in its best year since 2021. The conglomerate's strong performance relied on solid operating earnings , supported by strong investment income and underwriting earnings at auto insurer Geico, and came despite the ""Oracle of Omaha"" halting Berkshire's stock buyback program. Looking ahead, Wall Street sell-side analysts particularly favor Liberty Latin America , a telecommunications company in Latin America and the Caribbean, seeing the stock climbing nearly 58% in the next 12 months. Berkshire has owned a small stake in the company for almost 10 years. Given its size, worth just $37 million, the stock could have been bought by one of Buffett's investing lieutenants. Analysts see a 42% gain ahead for Atlanta Braves Holdings . The baseball franchise was previously one of the holding companies under John Malone 's Liberty Media umbrella, and was spun off last summer, starting the clock on a potential sale. Many have speculated that Braves, who were swept by the San Diego Padres in the 2024 National League Wild Card playoffs, could be taken private by a billionaire. Occidental Petroleum could rise more than 20% in the next 12 months, according to the average price target from analysts. The oil and gas producer is down 17% in the past year, prompting Buffett to take advantage of cheaper prices and scoop up more shares.

"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway beats S&P 500 in 2024, posts 9th straight up year","Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway outperformed the S & P 500 in 2024 and pulled off its best year since 2021. Class A shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate rallied 25.5% last year, beating the S & P 500's 23.3% return. Berkshire shares topped $700,000 during the year and posted their ninth positive year in a row. BRK.A 1Y mountain Berkshire Hathaway The strong performance came even as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" halted Berkshire's stock buyback program with the stock getting pricier and pricier. Instead, the conglomerate relied on solid operating earnings this past year, supported by strong investment income and underwriting earnings within auto insurer Geico. $325 billion cash Interest and other investment income reached $8 billion in the first three quarters of 2024, compared with the prior year's $4.2 billion. A big factor was Berkshire's gigantic war chest — some $325 billion as of the end of September, nearly double the $168 billion level at the end of 2023. Higher interest rates, albeit off their peak, still enabled the conglomerate to earn a competitive return on the cash hoard. The legendary 94-year-old investor amassed such a jaw-dropping amount of cash in 2024 by selling down his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America , a move that surprised many. He was in a selling mood for most of 2024, offloading $133 billion worth of stock in the first three quarters of the year. Winning Geico Geico, Berkshire's insurance crown jewel and what Buffett has called his ""favorite child,"" continued its turnaround story in 2024. The insurer recorded an underwriting profit of $5.7 billion in the first three quarters of 2024, more than doubling the $2.3 billion total in the same period of 2023. As recently as 2022, Geico suffered a $1.9 billion pretax underwriting loss as it sacrificed market share to competitor Progressive due to the slow adoption of telematics . Telematics software programs allow insurers to collect clients' driving data, including their mileage and speed, to help price policies. Geico helped offset the weakness in Berkshire's other insurance operations, including Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, which both experienced an underwriting loss in the third quarter of 2024. 'Wishful Thinking' While Berkshire outpaced the S & P 500 last year, Buffett has tempered expectations for future outperformance citing its enormous size. He noted that it's very difficult for any investments to move the needle because of the sheer amount of cash Berkshire is working with. Buffett said Berkshire's group of diversified, quality businesses — from BNSF Railway to See's Candy —should provide ""slightly better"" performance than the average U.S. company, but anything more than that is unlikely. 'With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,"" Buffett said in his 2023 annual letter. ""Anything beyond 'slightly better,' though, is wishful thinking."" Still, Buffett's long-term track record is unparalleled.

Warren Buffett heads into 2025 with his biggest cash position in more than 30 years,"Warren Buffett, who has long favored holding massive amounts of cash, is headed into 2025 with a particularly gigantic war chest at Berkshire Hathaway — in fact the largest cash hoard in 34 years. The Omaha-based conglomerate's cash level stands at $325 billion — a record high in absolute terms — and now accounts for about 30% of Berkshire's total assets, the highest percentage since 1990, according to data from Oppenheimer. Buffett first took control of Berkshire, originally a clothing manufacturer, in 1965 and went on to transform it into a one-of-a-kind conglomerate. Why is the 94-year-old legendary investor holding on to so much cash? The most obvious explanation could be that he simply isn't finding appealing areas that would enable him to deploy large portions of cash in an expensive market. The market's valuation has reached historic proportions using Buffett's own favorite gauge for overall valuation: the ratio of the total market value of U.S. stocks as a proportion of gross domestic product, The ""Buffett indicator"" has soared to an all-time high of 209%, a level last seen at the 1929 market peak. To put that into context, the gauge peaked at 140% before the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s, according to data from Oppenheimer. ""I think it is valuation and lack of finding attractive buys,"" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a longtime Berkshire shareholder, said of Berkshire's cash pile. ""It is tough to find his kind of quality companies on the cheap."" Berkshire's cash has only grown after Buffett this year aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America . He was in a selling mood for most of 2024, offloading $133 billion worth of stock in the first three quarters of the year.

Building the war chest could also benefit his chosen successor, Greg Abel. ""Some of the $325 billion in cash will eventually be used to invest in a 'distress' situation, either an industry or individual company similar to what BRK did during the last economic crisis,"" Kevin Heal, an analyst at Argus Research who covers Berkshire, said in a recent note.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire is having its best year since 2021 despite a buyback freeze and stock-selling spree,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is wrapping up a particularly strong year, even as the Oracle of Omaha paused buybacks and sold chunks of top holdings before their big rallies. Class A shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have climbed 27% in 2024, slightly outperforming the S & P 500. Berkshire, whose shares have exceeded the $700,000 threshold, is on track to post its best year since 2021 and its ninth positive year in a row. BRK.A YTD mountain Berkshire Hathaway The 94-year-old legendary investor made a slew of head-turning moves during the year. On the top of the list was aggressively dumping his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America . Buffett started trimming his stake in the iPhone maker in the fourth quarter of 2023 and ramped up selling in the second quarter of 2024, when he surprisingly dumped nearly half of the position . After offloading another quarter of his stake, Buffett now owns about 300 million shares. That's down 67.2% from the end of the third quarter last year. Spectators were also surprised by Buffett's downsizing of his longtime Bank of America stake. Berkshire started a selling spree in July that eventually took the holding below the 10% threshold, which puts further action under wraps for the time being. Both stocks have done well this year, however, with Apple up nearly 28% and Bank of America up over 35%. The bank stock got a big boost from the reelection of Donald Trump on hopes of deregulation in the banking industry. These are not the only stocks Berkshire sold this year. All told, Berkshire sold a whopping $133 billion worth of stocks in the first three quarters of 2024. Freezing buybacks As Berkshire's strong rally pushed up valuations, Buffett decided to bring buybacks to a halt. Berkshire didn't repurchase any company shares during the third quarter. Repurchase activity had already slowed down earlier in the year with just $345 million in the second quarter, significantly lower than the $2 billion repurchased in each of the prior two quarters. The company states that it will buy back stock when Buffett ""believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire's intrinsic value, conservatively determined."" $300 billion cash Berkshire's monstrous cash pile topped $300 billion for the first time during the third quarter amid Buffett's stock selling spree. As for major acquisitions, Buffett once again mostly sat on the sidelines as asset prices continued to ascend. One minor deal Berkshire did this year was buying the 8% remaining stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy , a utility giant it has owned a majority stake in since 1999. Berkshire bought the stake for $2.37 billion in cash, $600 million in debt as well as a significant amount of Berkshire Class B shares from the heirs of the late Walter Scott — a former director and a lifelong friend of Buffett who died in 2021. Some think that Buffett is holding out for better opportunities when prices come down during an economic downturn, while strengthening the cash war chest as a way to lay the foundation for his successor, Greg Abel. ""We believe that some of the $325 billion in cash will eventually be used to invest in a 'distress' situation, either an industry or individual company similar to what BRK did during the last economic crisis,"" Kevin Heal, Argus analyst who covers Berkshire, said in a note. ""This will also provide an opportunity for the successors to make their own mark when Mr. Buffett officially hands over the reins."" New stock picks Berkshire did make a few small equity investments during the year, likely by Buffett's investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.

Then, the ""Oracle of Omaha"" said the Republican's aggressive moves could cause negative consequences globally, including triggering inflation that could hurt consumers. ""If we actually have a trade war, it will be bad for the whole world … everything intersects in the world,"" Buffett said in a CNBC interview in 2019. ""A world that adjusts to something very close to free trade … more people will live better than in a world with significant tariffs and shifting tariffs over time."" Before Trump is inaugurated as the next U.S. president on Jan. 20, he already laid out a new wave of tariffs he intends to impose on his first day in office. In a series of social media posts, Trump threatened tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada and an extra 10% levy on China, citing illegal immigration and illicit drug trade as reasons for his policy. 'A tax on consumers' The legendary investor said the benefits of free trade are practically invisible as consumers are used to how things are priced. However, a reversal of that could cause a spike in prices, which would be felt instantly. Tariffs are ""a tax on consumers,"" Buffett said. ""It changes what people buy. It changes where things are produced. … You don't know what you would be paying for the clothes you're wearing today if we had a rule they all had to be manufactured in the United States."" He believes the leader of a country should do a good job of explaining the rationale behind the changes in trade policy. Some hold the view that the president-elect was dropping free-wheeling threats as a negotiating tactic to achieve other political outcomes such as curbing illegal drugs. Others believe the U.S. could see a replay of punitive, retaliatory levies in a full-blown trade war from Trump's first term. ""I've always said that the president, any president needs to be an educator-in-chief, which [Franklin] Roosevelt was in the Depression,"" Buffett said during Berkshire's annual meeting in 2018. ""You have to be very good at explaining how it does really hurt, in a real way.""",2024-12-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/08/what-warren-buffett-said-about-trumps-first-trade-war.html,cnbc
Junk food lover Warren Buffett's new pizza investment fits perfectly in Berkshire's portfolio,"Warren Buffett, a celebrated lover of junk food, just bought into a national pizza chain whose shares are trading near their cheapest level of the year. With CEO Buffett at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 1.2 million shares of Domino's Pizza last quarter, a stake worth about $550 million, a recent regulatory filing showed. Given its small size in Berkshire's massive portfolio — cash holdings alone top $300 billion — Buffett's investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs may be behind the investment. Whosever original idea, Domino's Pizza is in keeping with other, long-standing investments by the sprawling Omaha-based conglomerate. Berkshire already owns 100% of See's Candies and Dairy Queen , and counts Coca-Cola and Oscar Meyer hot dog-parent Kraft Heinz among its top equity holdings. Buffett, a 94-year-old billionaire known for childlike dietary habits, has famously said he would happily drink five cans of Coke and eat McDonald's every day. Yet, despite the seemingly indulgent diet, Buffett remains in good health. ""I eat like a 6-year-old,"" the Berkshire CEO once said. ""I'm one quarter Coca-Cola,"" Buffett famously quipped. In 2014, Berkshire invested $3 billion in shares of Restaurant Brands International , owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons and in the 1990s owned a large position in McDonald's. DPZ YTD mountain Domino's Pizza shares have trailed the S & P 500 this year. Value bet Domino's fits into Berkshire's value investment philosophy, focused on cash flow and price-to-earnings and price-to-book-value yardsticks. At the same time, Berkshire may have simply taken advantage of a steep sell-off in Domino's in July, when it slumped 17%. One day, shares in the world's largest pizza chain plunged more than 13%, its worst decline since 2008, after telling investors that sales would miss an original forecast and fewer new stores would open overseas than originally planned. As a result, Domino's price-to-earnings ratio fell to 23.7, the lowest this year, according to FactSet data. Pizza wars The pizza chain has struggled with comparable sales growth in the U.S. as competition for cost-conscious customers mounts. ""Near-term fundamentals remain under pressure,"" said Jeffrey Bernstein, a Barclays Capital analyst. ""Similar to the 'burger wars' of years past, management believes we are now in the midst of 'pizza wars', with all focused on incremental value."" Even after Berkshire's disclosure boosted Domino's stock, it's still up just about 10% this year, far behind the S & P 500's 25% return. The Barclays analyst, who recently met with Domino's management, said Berkshire's newly-disclosed stake was mentioned in the meeting but that the company didn't have much to add. ""We don't believe they spoke with Warren,"" Bernstein told CNBC, referring to Domino's management, but executives probably ""received questions from the conglomerate ahead of the stake being announced.""",2024-11-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/buffetts-new-pizza-investment-a-perfect-fit-in-berkshires-portfolio.html,cnbc
Warren Buffett's Bank of America position goes under wraps. Here's what could happen next,"Berkshire Hathaway's Bank of America stake has finally been cut to below the key 10% threshold, keeping Warren Buffett's next potential moves under wraps for a few months. The conglomerate has reduced its holding in the Charlotte-based lender to precisely 775 million shares, or about 9.987%, after 15 consecutive days of selling. Since the stake is now below 10%, Berkshire is no longer required to report related transactions in a timely manner, meaning within two business days. Investors likely won't find out Buffett's exact action until mid-February in the 13F filing that reveals Berkshire's end-of-year holdings. The next 13F filing in mid-November will only show positions as of the end of September. Still, many observed that the 94-year-old investment icon would need to continue to sell BofA shares for the time being in order to keep his stake below the 10% mark. That's because CEO Brian Moynihan recently said the bank has been buying back a lot of shares to partly offset the selling from its biggest institutional investor, which reduces the number of shares outstanding. Shares of BofA have held up well during Buffett's exodus, up 0.6% in the past three months. The stock has gained almost 25% in all of 2024 thus far. BAC YTD mountain Bank of America Since mid-July, Berkshire has sold shares in Bank of America virtually every day (47 days in total) whenever the stock has traded above $39.25, according to Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. In total, Berkshire has dumped $10.5 billion worth of BAC shares, or 25% of its position. Buffett originally acquired his massive BofA stake in two stages. He famously bought $5 billion of preferred stock and warrants in 2011 to shore up confidence in the embattled lender in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis , and later converted the warrants to common stock in 2017. After getting the Federal Reserve's approval to raise the holding above 10%, Buffett bought 300 million additional shares in the open market in 2018 and 2019. The first 700 million shares had a low cost basis of only about $7 per share, while the average cost of the next 300 million shares was in the $30s, Goldberg estimated. The analyst said due to tax implications, it's possible that Berkshire could stop selling once it gets back to 700 million shares, which would take another 16.5 days of sales based on its recent trading patterns. Exiting entirely? It's also speculated that Buffett could exit the position entirely. The Berkshire CEO has said in the past that he doesn't like to merely trim positions if his view on the stock has shifted. ""When we sell something, very often it's going to be our entire stake,"" Buffett said in 2020 when he entirely dumped his holdings in airlines. ""I mean, we don't trim positions. That's just not the way we approach it, any more than if we buy a hundred percent of a business, we're going to sell it down to 90% or 80%."" To be sure, the BofA position could be a unique case due to Buffett's admiration for the management and the deal he personally negotiated in 2011. Still, Buffett sounded negative towards banking following 2023's regional bank crisis that took down Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Buffett believes bank failures in 2008 during the financial crisis, and again in 2023, lessened confidence in the entire system, made worse by poor messaging from regulators and politicians. Meanwhile, digitalization and fintech made bank runs a far simpler matter at times of crisis. ""You don't know what has happened to the stickiness of deposits at all,"" Buffett said in May 2023. ""It got changed by 2008. It's gotten changed by [the regional bank crisis]. And that changes everything. We're very cautious in a situation like that about ownership of banks."" Buffett spent the past few years dumping a variety of longtime holdings in the banking industry, including JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp .",2024-10-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/13/buffetts-bank-of-america-stake-goes-dark-what-could-happen-next.html,cnbc
"Berkshire Hathaway now owns 100% of BHE, but the utility giant has been a weak spot for the conglomerate","Warren Buffett took full control of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility giant that it has owned a majority stake in since 1999, but the business has been a drag on the conglomerate. The Omaha-based Berkshire entered a deal to acquire the 8% remaining stake in BHE from the heirs of the late Walter Scott, a former director and a lifelong friend of Buffett who died in 2021. Berkshire bought the stake for $2.37 billion in cash, $600 million in debt as well as a significant amount of Berkshire Class B shares , according to a regulatory filing. Analysts and investors who watch the conglomerate closely seem to believe that the deal price marked a drop in valuation for BHE, whose businesses including energy, utility and pipeline operations experienced a tumultuous period with liabilities related to wildfires. ""Buffett didn't pay a premium for BHE, which implies that he is still concerned about the future of the business,"" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, told CNBC. Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, sold his 1% stake in BHE for $870 million at a much higher valuation just two years ago. Abel is currently the chairman of BHE. 'A Costly Mistake' Buffett has recently expressed a fatalistic view about the utility industry amid staggering losses from wildfires as well as a tough regulatory environment. ""It will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE's forest-fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states,"" he wrote in his 2023 annual letter. ""I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire's two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so."" The 94-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" said the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy, making what was once one of the most stable industries extremely unpredictable. The utility arm has been a weak spot for the conglomerate, which has otherwise enjoyed a few outstanding years. Berkshire's 2024 rally has propelled it to a $1 trillion market cap , the first non-tech company in the U.S. to reach such a milestone. ""BHE has been under pressure,"" said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. ""First half 2024 revenues at BHE were off fractionally and pretax profits fell more than 10%.""",2024-10-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/06/berkshire-owns-100percent-of-bhe-but-the-utilitys-a-weak-spot-for-the-conglomerate.html,cnbc
"How Warren Buffett decides when to sell a stock, and why he might be dumping Bank of America","When Warren Buffett, the ultimate buy-and-hold investor, sells a stock, it often sends a negative signal about the underlying business and maybe even the entire industry. The Sage of Omaha, whose preferred holding period is forever, is usually only motivated to exit a big position when he judges that the competitive edge of a business has eroded. ""We're more reluctant to sell them than most people,"" Buffett said of his large positions at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2009. ""If we made the right decision going in, we like to ride that a very long time, and we've owned some stocks for decades. But if the competitive advantage disappears, if we really lose faith in the management, if we were wrong in the original analysis — and that happens — we sell."" For example, when Buffett invested in newspapers like the Omaha World-Herald and Buffalo News in the 1970s, he thought their franchises were impregnable. But by the early 2000s his view on the industry soured as declining advertising revenue and the transition to digital platforms destroyed profits. He eventually sold his 30-odd newspapers in early 2020. Bank of America sales Many top holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio are decades old — Buffett has held Coca-Cola shares since 1988 and American Express since 1991. Maybe that's why the 94-year-old investment legend recently raised eyebrows as he dumped about $9 billion of Bank of America shares in a selling spree starting in mid-July. Buffett famously bought $5 billion of BofA preferred stock and warrants in 2011 to shore up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages. He converted the warrants to common stock in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" then added 300 million more shares to his bet in 2018 and 2019. The recent BofA sales came after Buffett spent the past few years dumping a variety of longtime holdings in the banking industry, including JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp . Berkshire still holds a 10.3% stake in Bank of America. If the selling continues and the holding drops below the 10% reporting threshold, we won't know how far Buffett has reduced the position until the quarterly 13-F updates. 'We're very cautious' So, does Buffett think BofA and others have lost their competitive advantage? Maybe. Last year, shortly after the regional banking crisis that drove Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic into the arms of saviors , the Berkshire CEO hinted at nascent problems in the banking industry. ""We don't know where the shareholders of the big banks, necessarily, or the regional banks or any bank, are heading now,"" Buffett said in 2023. ""The American public is probably as confused about banking as ever. And that has consequences. Nobody knows what the consequences are because every event starts recreating a different dynamic."" Buffett said bank failures in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis , and again in 2023, lessened confidence in the system, made worse by poor messaging by regulators and politicians. Meanwhile, digitalization and fintech made bank runs a simple matter at times of crisis. The collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank early last year , two of the largest bank failures ever, prompted extraordinary rescues from regulators, who backstopped all deposits in the failed lenders and provided an additional funding facility for other troubled banks. ""You don't know what has happened to the stickiness of deposits at all,"" Buffett said. ""It got changed by 2008. It's gotten changed by this. And that changes everything. We're very cautious in a situation like that about ownership of banks."" At the time, Buffett foresaw more bank failures down the road , but stuck with his Bank of America investment, partly because he personally negotiated the original deal and admired CEO Brian Moynihan. ""But do I know how to project out what's going to happen from here?,"" Buffett asked at the time of last year's failures. ""The answer is I don't."" Not exactly a ringing endorsement.",2024-09-29 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/29/how-buffett-decides-when-to-sell-a-stock-and-what-dumping-bofa-says.html,cnbc
A new ETF uses AI to emulate Warren Buffett's investment style,"Human investors who have tried to replicate Warren Buffett have mostly failed miserably, but now artificial intelligence is taking a crack at it. Investment startup Intelligent Alpha is working on launching the Intelligent Omaha ETF , with the ticker AIWB, that relies on AI to emulate the Berkshire Hathaway CEO's investment philosophy and create a portfolio of 25-30 stocks that it thinks Buffett might buy. So, how does it work exactly? The first step is to feed AI — three large language models GPT, Gemini and Claude — enough information for it to learn the essence of Buffett. That includes any publicly available writings (Buffett's famous annual letters since the 1960s), any public interviews or statements he's made, as well as regulatory filings like the 13Fs that reveal Berkshire's public equity holdings. ""If you give AI a bunch of information about how you want it to think and how you want to respond and think about the world, it will play that role perfectly in our testing,"" Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder, said in an interview. It remains to be seen how deeply AI could understand Buffett's unique investing style that has evolved significantly over seven decades. He started out only buying ""cigar-butt,"" dirt-cheap securities for quick profit and later, under the late Charlie Munger's influence, focused on quality companies with ""wide moats"" selling at fair prices. Now that Berkshire's market value approaches $1 trillion, fewer and fewer investments move the needle for the conglomerate, which partly drove Buffett to go all in on Apple. Not to mention, Buffett's reputation as one of the most shrewd and cash-rich investors enabled him to score many lucrative deals through personal negotiations, especially during crises . ""The Omaha strategy is very much built around value in the context of Buffett, trying to find companies that have long duration,"" Clinton said. All about AI Intelligent Alpha has been testing its Buffett strategy for six months and the portfolio AI puts together would overlap Berkshire's by anywhere between 30 to 60%. The same stocks might have a different weighting in the ETF, which would charge an expense ratio of 69 basis points. The fund is set to debut sometime in the next six months. The firm already has an AI-powered ETF on the market — the Intelligent Livermore ETF , which aims to imitate a dozen prominent investors' approaches, including Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller and David Tepper. That fund started trading last Wednesday. These offerings mark Wall Street's latest attempt to incorporate buzzy AI applications in products to attract investors curious about what the advanced technology can produce. AI has been the hottest investment theme for the past two years, with stocks like Nvidia being the biggest beneficiaries, but many remain skeptical of its lasting power and impact on everyday life. ""The vision for Intelligent Alpha is to build the AI-powered BlackRock,"" Clinton said. ""There are two big pillars, serving retail investors [through Registered Investment Advisors], and then there's serving institutional investors.""",2024-09-22 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/22/a-new-etf-uses-ai-to-emulate-warren-buffetts-investment-style.html,cnbc
Big stock sales from tight-lipped Berkshire Hathaway executives are saying a lot,"Top bosses at Berkshire Hathaway are usually tight-lipped about their market outlook, but recent investment actions from the executives are saying a lot. News broke earlier this week that Ajit Jain, the conglomerate's insurance chief for nearly 40 years, sold more than half of his Berkshire stake worth $139 million. That marked the biggest sale of Berkshire stock by the 73-year-old vice chairman of insurance operations since he was hired by Warren Buffett in 1986. Those sales came on the heels of Berkshire Class A stock closing above $700,00 for the first time ever and the Omaha-based giant topping a $1 trillion market capitalization , the first time a company outside technology reached that milestone in the U.S. That led some to believe that Jain at the very least was signaling Berkshire shares are no longer cheap. The stock has gained nearly 24% in 2024, outperforming the S & P 500, which is ahead 18%. ""I think Ajit sold because the stock was fully pricing the business,"" said Steve Check, founder of Check Capital Management, which has Berkshire as its biggest holding. BRK.A YTD mountain Berkshire Hathaway Buyback slowdown Judging from Berkshire's lack of buyback activity, Buffett, the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" might hold the same view. Berkshire bought back just $345 million worth of its own stock last quarter, far below the $2 billion repurchased in each of the prior two quarters. Buffett only buys back shares when he thinks the stock is selling for less than it's worth. He believes it would be ""value-destroying"" if he overpaid for Berkshire shares. The legendary investor tempered investor expectations earlier this year, saying his sprawling empire may only slightly outperform the average American company due to its sheer size and the lack of buying opportunities that could make an impact. 'With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,"" Buffett said in his annual letter. ""Anything beyond 'slightly better,' though, is wishful thinking."" Brian Meredith, Berkshire analyst at UBS, correctly predicted that Berkshire, the owner of Geico insurance and BNSF Railway, would join the ranks of companies with a $1 trillion market value. Using a sum-of-the parts valuation method, Meredith estimated that Berkshire Class A shares are fully valued at $759,574, or about 6% above a recent high of $715,910. Downsizing big bets Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO and chairman, might also think some of his favorite stocks are getting too expensive. He dumped another chunk of Bank of America shares this week, bringing his total sales to more than $7 billion since mid-July and reducing his stake to 11%. That's on top of his head-turning sale of Apple in the second quarter. Berkshire offloaded a little more than 49% of the tech stake, although Apple remained the largest stock stake by far in Berkshire's portfolio even after the sale. Berkshire has been a seller of stocks for seven stright quarters, but the selling accelerated in the second quarter with Buffett shedding more than $75 billion in equities. That brings the total of stocks sold in the first half of 2024 to more than $90 billion. Buffett's sale of large pieces of Apple and Bank of America, his top two holdings, could be portfolio management, and he has also hinted that saving on taxes could be a motivation. But the magnitude of the sales could also suggest a bearish attitude toward the market and stock valuations.",2024-09-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/14/stock-sales-from-tight-lipped-berkshire-hathaway-executives-say-a-lot.html,cnbc
"Warren Buffett doesn't pay attention to macro factors when investing, and here's why","Weakness in the job market , shifting expectations of the Federal Reserve's next move, fears of a hard landing, the risk of sticky inflation and the upcoming presidential election. To Warren Buffett , none of that macroeconomic stuff matters. The ""Oracle of Omaha,"" who turned 94 years old last week, is a firm believer that successful investing is about finding a wonderful business within one's circle of competence at an attractive price, and the rest is just noise. ""If we find a business that we think we understand and we like the price at which it's being offered, we buy it,"" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2012. ""It doesn't make any difference what the headlines are, it doesn't make any difference what the Federal Reserve is doing, it doesn't make any difference what's going on in Europe. We buy it."" Whether it's buying a company's stock or the entire company, the Berkshire chairman and CEO tends to only pull the trigger when he can grasp the intrinsic value of an asset, understand competition in that industry and how it may evolve in the future. ""If we're right about the business, the macro factors aren't going to make any difference. And if we're wrong about the business, macro factors are not going to bail us out,"" he said. ""We look to value, and we don't look to headlines at all. ... Everybody thinks we sit around and talk about macro factors. We don't have any discussions about macro factors."" Investors face more volatility as passive index funds and quantitative momentum investments have soared in popularity. These vehicles, which track benchmarks or use trend-following models, have put a large portion of buy and sell decisions in the hands of automated machines. Some argue that it has made the market increasingly sensitive to headlines — and prone to sharp price swings. 'America is not going to go away' Buffett, who at Columbia University studied under Benjamin Graham , the fabled father of value investing, has ignored negative headlines even during some of the worst periods of American history, from the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to the terrorist attack on 9/11 in 2001 to the great financial crisis of 2008. Instead, he's known for taking advantage of any turmoil to buy assets that are suddenly on sale. The legendary investor famously penned a New York Times op-ed column in October 2008 when markets came crashing down over the deepening mortgage crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers. His message: be greedy when others are fearful because ""America is not going to go away; stocks are cheap."" ""There's always going to be good and bad news out there.

"Bitcoin is just another tech stock, not a market hedge, study shows","Bitcoin is more closely correlated to the Nasdaq than it is to gold most of the time, and investors could benefit from viewing it as another big tech stock, says Standard Chartered. Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq is currently at about 0.5, after it approached 0.8 earlier this year, according to the bank. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold has been falling since January, touching zero at one point, and is now just above 0.2. ""Bitcoin trading is highly correlated to the Nasdaq over short time horizons,"" Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, said in a note Monday. ""This Nasdaq correlation leads to the idea that bitcoin could be included in a basket of large tech stocks; if it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios."" Bitcoin is frequently viewed as ""digital gold"" and a hedge against risks facing the traditional financial sector. Kendrick said he still sees the flagship cryptocurrency serving that purpose but that ""in reality … the need for such hedges is very infrequent."" Standard Chartered created a hypothetical index dubbed ""Mag 7B,"" in which it added bitcoin to the Magnificent 7 tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – and removed Tesla. ""Mag 7B has outperformed Mag 7 by about 5% over the period since December 2017,"" he said. ""On a calendar year basis, Mag 7B outperformed Mag 7 in five out of seven years, albeit by a very small margin in 2022. Mag 7B's relative returns are decent on both an absolute basis (averaging around 1% a year above Mag 7) and a calendar-year basis."" Kendrick said bitcoin has been trading in a similar volatility-adjusted fashion to Nvidia since President Trump's inauguration. They're down 16% and 12%, respectively, since Jan. 20. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has lost 36% in the same period, is trading more like ether (down 38% since Jan. 20). ""Investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against [traditional finance] and as part of their tech allocation,"" Kendrick said. ""Indeed, as BTC's role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized."" Bitcoin is down about 5% for the year after Trump's tariff threats in recent weeks have brought new volatility to the market. Investors are expecting relief in the second quarter, however, given bitcoin's two of its most persistent correlations : its positive correlation with money supply growth, also known as M2, and its negative correlation with the U.S. dollar index, or DXY . —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

Bullish Michael Saylor says 'bitcoin will rip forward with a vengeance' when risk-on returns to market,"Bitcoin will no doubt rally once investor confidence returns, Michael Saylor says. The flagship digital currency, down about 10% in 2025, has been consolidating for several weeks as President Trump's tariffs have intensified global economic concerns, keeping investors out of risk assets. ""The market is really skittish based upon concerns about tariffs,"" said the founder and chairman of the aggressive bitcoin acquirer Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy. ""The disposition of the U.S. economy, the interest rate forward graph … the interest rates have pulled in 30, 40, 50 basis points. And we're in this macro risk off zone. When that flips, I think Bitcoin will rip forward with a vengeance."" He added that ""if you're going to put a billion dollar bet on right now, the only thing you would do is put a billion dollar bet on bitcoin as a long term store of value, that is clear."" Saylor is laser focused on bitcoin but even he sees it as only one tier of several that make up the broader digital economy. Speaking with CNBC's Bob Pisani at the advisor-focused Future Proof conference in Miami on Monday, Saylor mapped out four sectors of the crypto ecosystem fueled by blockchain technology. Saylor, famously bullish on bitcoin, said the cryptocurrency sits at the top of a hierarchy of assets as a digital commodity; followed by digital currencies, or stablecoins; tokenized stocks and bonds that can circulate 24/7; and finally, digital tokens. ""A digital token will be the lowest threshold,"" he said. ""Anybody can launch a token, it won't be a security, it will stop short in the utility that's deemed legally a security."" ""The big unlock is that digital token economy, and for that to take shape in a legitimate way, we actually need a digital assets framework endorsed by Washington, D.C. passed into law,"" he added. He noted that the U.S. is making progress on that front, with the Securities and Exchange Commission undertaking ""an elaborate set of meetings"" to determine what constitutes a security. The 60-year-old billionaire also expressed confidence in the progress of the GENIUS Act, the proposed stablecoin focused bill that passed the Senate last week and now heads to the House.

Standard Chartered slashes ether price target by more than half but still sees a turnaround this year,"Ether may not hit a new record this year after all, according to Standard Chartered. The firm expects ether's recent weakness to continue this year, and although it sees its price more than doubling this year from current levels, Standard Chartered cut its year-end price target on the coin to $4,000 from $10,000. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 42% this year and at $1,932, it's trading at its lowest level since 2023. (For comparison, crypto leader bitcoin is down 10% year to date.) The recent sell-off in risk assets, fueled by skittish investors worried about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on the global economy, has made things even worse for the coin. Ether had already been suffering from an identity crisis, weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana, when it was dealt this latest blow. ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) 1-year ""We still see ETH-USD rising from the current level of $1,900 as BTC price gains lift all large digital assets this year. But we see ETH underperformance continuing,"" Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said in a note Monday. ""It is possible that market dynamics could eventually halt Ethereum's structural decline, especially if tokenized real-world assets were to grow significantly,"" he added. ""ETH's security dominance means it should maintain its 80% share of this market. However, we think this possibility is no longer a sound basis for our medium-term views."" Kendrick pointed to the increasing dominance of so-called Layer 2 solutions. These are secondary blockchains built on top of base layer networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin to extend their capabilities, but can shift investment and usage away from the underlying network. In particular, Coinbase's Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum, called Base, has extracted about $50 billion of ether's market cap, and Kendrick said he expects that number to rise over time. Kendrick also noted that transaction fees on Ethereum have been lower since the last big technical upgrade, dubbed ""Dencun,"" which took place in March 2024. ""While [Ethereum] still dominates on several metrics – with shares of more than 50% of total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, 57% of stablecoins and 80% of tokenized assets – its dominance has been waning for some time,"" Kendrick said. ""Assuming no change in direction from the Ethereum Foundation, we think ETH-BTC will continue to head lower over the next two years, from the current level of 0.023 to 0.015 by 2027 – the lowest level since early 2017,"" he added. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2025-03-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/17/standard-chartered-slashes-ether-price-target-but-still-sees-a-turnaround-this-year.html,cnbc
Wall Street expects a second-quarter bitcoin rally after more weakness through March,"Bitcoin investors could get some relief in the second quarter if the cryptocurrency maintains two of its most persistent correlations, according to analysts. The price of bitcoin (BTC) is down 14% in 2025 and is sitting about 26% off its January all-time high after President Donald Trump 's tariff threats have wreaked havoc on the market. This week, bitcoin has held steady around the $80,000 level despite broader market volatility, leaving many investors of the cryptocurrency wondering if this is a buying opportunity or if there's more pain in store. Wall Street is taking clues from the flagship crypto's positive correlation with money supply growth, also known as M2, and its negative correlation with the U.S. dollar index, or DXY . ""Bitcoin has consistently tracked the inverted DXY on a ~10-week lag,"" Wells Fargo equity analyst Christopher Harvey said in a note Wednesday. ""The relationship suggests the current drawdown is a reaction to the strong dollar environment in [the fourth quarter], and that the weak dollar environment we have seen since the DXY peaked on January 13 (eight weeks ago) may be more constructive for the asset going forward."" If these correlations hold up, bitcoin could rally after this month, according to Ed Engel, an analyst at Compass Point. ""Global M2 has historically led BTC prices by three months, while BTC historically performs best during global liquidity expansion and USD weakness,"" Engel explained in a note Monday. ""After Global M2 peaked in late September, liquidity contracted in Q4 before bottoming in early 2025. Since then, Global M2 has rebounded alongside recent USD weakness."" ""If BTC maintains its correlation with Global M2, this implies further weakness in March before a significant rally in 2Q25,"" he added. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin (BTC) this year The cryptocurrency market has struggled for several weeks despite the industry's shifting political fortunes. The U.S. crypto industry is now operating under a Congress that is especially favorable toward it, and the Trump administration has made sweeping promises to create an environment in which crypto businesses can thrive . But even while the industry cheers the de-risking of U.S. crypto businesses, clear guidelines for companies haven't yet been established. Perhaps more importantly, trade war concerns have had a bigger hold on the market: Stocks have tumbled this week despite encouraging inflation data . ""While we hold out hope for the group, knowing bullish commentary/news is always capable of sending prices soaring overnight, we are bound to the charts,"" Wolfe Research said in a note on Wednesday. ""We are seeing notable breakdowns across the board through key support levels,"" the firm added. ""This is not the action of a group readying to rally. Instead, we fear it speaks towards a shift into a period of sustained weakness."" A move above the $91,000 to $92,000 range would allow for a sigh of relief in the near term, Wolfe Research said. The $90,000 threshold has acted as key support for bitcoin this year. ""Our sense is that it would likely get sold however,"" the firm said.

Why Trump's crypto order disappointed: 'This is not the aggressive bitcoin reserve some were pressing for',"President Donald Trump on Thursday night officially established the widely anticipated U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve , fulfilling a major re-election campaign promise to the crypto industry. The market didn't seem to care much, however. Cryptocurrencies have recovered most of their initial losses after a quick drop following the news. Bitcoin was hovering at $88,000, the same level at traded at before Trump signed the executive order. Ether and the Solana token inched slightly higher, while XRP and the coin tied to Cardano were lower. While many praised the executive order as being a good and reasonable approach, especially given how disconcerted so many in the crypto community were by his mention of smaller and riskier coins beyond bitcoin in his pre-announcement last weekend, it left the crypto community wanting more. ""President Trump on Thursday night unveiled a bitcoin reserve and a crypto stockpile. Both will be funded by crypto the government seizes. This is not the aggressive bitcoin reserve some were pressing for,"" TD Cowen's Jaret Seiberg said in a note Friday. ""We view this as a compromise,"" he added. The government is not spending taxpayer dollars to acquire new digital assets. It is simply not selling the ones that it seizes … We are dubious that government will be acquiring additional bitcoin for the reserve despite the President's instructions as we believe it will be politically tough to show how purchases are budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs of taxpayers."" BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin (BTC) this week Still, Seiberg acknowledged that the directive is ""positive for crypto as it shows White House support for digital assets."" For many crypto investors, it also assuages fear of the government selling or banning bitcoin; increases the likelihood that other countries will buy bitcoin and raises its legitimacy among financial institutions; wealth managers and pensions who have been on the fence or altogether discouraged from participating in this market. But analysts at Compass Point said the order was ""almost nothing."" They emphasized that it doesn't exactly permit the Treasury Department or other government agencies to acquire crypto assets. On top of that, it can easily be undone with another executive order in the future. ""An executive order is not legislation, it is an exercise of executive authority, and it is not durable,"" analyst Edwin Groshans said in a note. ""Without legislation passed by Congress, there is no statutory text that can only be unwound by Congress."" ""To be frank, we view its issuance to be a dud that will not provide support to the value of BTC or any other digital asset, primarily because there is no authorization to purchase BTC and the purchase of digital assets are expressly prohibited,"" he added. ""We will reassess the relevance of the SBR when Treasury and Commerce publish the strategies to acquire BTC."" Plus, traditional macro investors aren't that interested in it yet, according to Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the ""Crypto is Macro Now"" newsletter. For now, she added, the macro mood continues to weigh heavy on crypto markets. ""There is nothing on the immediate horizon to suggest relief for the building concern about a slowdown,"" Acheson said. ""The Trump tariff shift yesterday, granting a one-month reprieve to some goods, lifted stocks briefly before investors decided that this flip-flopping is more part of the problem than it is a cure.""",2025-03-07 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/why-trumps-crypto-order-disappointed-this-is-not-the-aggressive-bitcoin-reserve-some-were-pressing-for.html,cnbc
"Bitcoin to stay under pressure in the near term, JPMorgan warns","JPMorgan doesn't expect a big move higher in crypto in the near future. Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin rallied to start the week following a social media update by President Donald Trump on the widely expected bitcoin stockpile, which has become a ""strategic crypto reserve."" Those gains quickly reversed as part of a broader sell-off on tariff concerns, but there is also lingering skepticism about the crypto reserve now that the market has had some time to digest it, JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note Wednesday. ""Overall we believe that crypto markets are likely to remain under pressure over the near term,"" he said. ""Not only is there skepticism about congressional approval for such a strategic crypto reserve, but also the feasibility of including smaller tokens outside bitcoin and [ether] given their higher risk and volatility."" Panigirtzoglou went on to highlight that bitcoin reserves have failed to gain traction at the state level, with Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming rejecting proposals due to concerns about risk and volatility. The central banks of Switzerland and Poland have also rejected the idea, he noted. With the market still absent a crypto-specific catalyst, demand for bitcoin has weakened, he also pointed out. ""Institutional investors appeared to have also reduced their positions due to lack of positive catalysts and due to momentum decay,"" he said. ""Our futures position proxies for bitcoin and [ether] based on open interest changes in CME futures contracts, have subsided but rather modestly … suggesting there is room for further position unwinding, especially now that momentum traders have started building up short positions."" Another sign of weaker demand is the recent $2 billion convertible debt issued by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, Panigirtzoglou said. Since the election, Strategy and bitcoin miners such as Mara Holdings have raised large amounts of capital by issuing equity and debt, which has contributed to bitcoin's price appreciation. But now the terms of these deals are ""increasingly more investor-friendly over the past month or so,"" he explained, ""indicating that investors are becoming more cautious and more selective.""",2025-03-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/bitcoin-to-stay-under-pressure-in-the-near-term-jpmorgan-warns.html,cnbc
Bitcoin closes out its worst month since 2022. March may bring more of the same,"Bitcoin may be defenseless against macroeconomic headwinds in the month ahead, despite the strong regulatory tailwinds. The flagship cryptocurrency is on pace to finish February down 19% – which would make it its worst month since June 2022 – after a broader risk-off move this week knocked it to a three-month low and put it more than 25% off its record. The outlook for its return to its uptrend in March isn't promising, investors say. Historically, March performance for bitcoin is uncertain, on average. It's finished March in the green in just six of the last 12 years, though it hasn't seen a March loss since 2020. However, its average return for the month in the same period is 13%, according to CoinGlass. ""Macro factors will continue to be the biggest driver of digital asset price performance over the short-term,"" said H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese told CNBC. ""Austerity measures the government is taking through DOGE, tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico expected to go into effect in March, and sticky inflation have worked together to create a risk-off environment."" BTC.CM= 1M mountain Bitcoin is heading for its worst month since 2022 ""We are neutral over the short-term and expect bitcoin to consolidate in this mid-$80,000 to low-$100,000 range until we get the next wave of crypto-specific catalysts,"" he added. ""With all that said, we remain bullish over the medium term on regulatory tailwinds and growing institutional adoption."" Headwinds vs. tailwinds Bitcoin kicked off the year in rally mode, fueled by optimism about the positive changes the new Trump administration would make for the crypto industry. However, since the president issued his widely anticipated executive order on crypto at the end of January, crypto investors have had little to look forward to. That's despite the Securities and Exchange Commission moving swiftly on several cases pending from the previous administration. In February alone, the agency ended its enforcement case against Coinbase ; closed its investigations into Robinhood's crypto unit , Uniswap, Gemini and Consensys with no enforcement action; scaled back its crypto enforcement unit; and on Thursday night, issued a statement clarifying that meme coins are not securities . Optimism about the long-term positive impact of Trump's crypto policies remains high, but absent a clear catalyst, bitcoin's movements may continue to be dictated by macroeconomic trends. Many have warned that bitcoin could return to pre-election levels around $70,000 before reversing higher. ""Short term, [crypto] markets are in a pretty fragile state, and part of that has to do with the macro environment,"" said David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase. ""There are a lot of concerns surrounding tariffs and for a while [they] weren't really being priced in by markets. Now it seems to be fully getting priced in because we're also seeing negative survey data – it's all contributing to concerns around the U.S. growth story more broadly."" Investors will be closely watching the February consumer price report due March 12 and the two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting beginning March 18. Silver linings Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, said there could be an opportunity in March to put bitcoin's attractiveness as a portfolio diversifier on display. ""There will be an opportunity for bitcoin to shine if we see any intensified stress in global markets,"" he said. ""There will be a place, if we do get down into the $70,000 to $75,000 area, where bitcoin starts to show it's not necessarily correlated with stocks and risk sentiment … [and] perhaps show itself more as the store of value asset."" ""Within the darkness of the pullbacks that will be a silver lining,"" he added. ""It will allow bitcoin to show itself for its real properties, which will help to further its maturity as an asset.""",2025-02-28 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/bitcoin-closes-out-its-worst-month-since-2022-march-may-bring-more-of-the-same.html,cnbc
"Bitcoin could return to pre-election levels after this week’s selloff, says Wolfe","Bitcoin investors may still have more pain ahead, according to Wolfe Research.

Now it's at a critical juncture: if it fails to retake $90,000, it could pull as far back as $70,000, the researcher said. ""We could be in for a return to the mid to low $70,000 range,"" Wolfe analyst Read Harvey said in a note Wednesday. ""$91,000 acted as the floor over the past several months.

Coinbase just reported a blowout fourth quarter. Here's what Wall Street is saying,"Several analysts raised their price targets on Coinbase shares after the crypto exchange operator reported a blowout fourth quarter postmarket Thursday. Coinbase handily beat expectations , with performance driven largely by a surge in trading activity during the postelection crypto rally. Earnings per share came in at $4.68, more than double the $1.81 Wall Street had expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG. Revenue was $2.27 billion for the quarter, compared with consensus expectations of $1.88 billion. Shares pulled back as much as 7.2% intraday Friday, after rallying 8% ahead of the results, but the Street remains optimistic on the outlook. CEO Brian Armstrong emphasized on the earnings call that it is ""the dawn of a new era"" for the crypto industry, signaling an expanded total addressable market, or TAM, for Coinbase. ""Up to 10% of global GDP could be running on crypto rails by the end of this decade, and Coinbase is going to be the preferred partner to come in and build this for many of the companies out there,"" he said. Many on Wall Street echoed that optimism, citing the sea change in the U.S. government's regulatory approach to crypto that is more supportive of the industry and that is likely to allow Coinbase to focus more on future growth and innovation and less on fighting regulatory battles. Here's what Wall Street had to say: Citizens JMP raises price target to $475 from $400 Analyst Devin Ryan reiterated his market outperform rating on Coinbase, praising the company's strong fourth quarter, near-term momentum and revenue diversification efforts. Coinbase ""is finally being unshackled to reach the potential that we believe management envisioned years ago — which extends well beyond providing access to buying and selling digital assets ... The strength in results was broad-based, with elevated transaction activity as industry volumes accelerated post-U.S. election … and we were also encouraged by Subscription & Services revenue of $641M, reaching a record (up over 70% YOY), highlighting ongoing diversification efforts which we anticipate are set to accelerate materially."" Oppenheimer raises price target to $388 from $344 The strong fourth quarter is just the beginning for Coinbase, according to analyst Owen Lau. He kept his outperform rating, highlighting the company's market share and growth prospects under the Trump administration. ""Since December, COIN has taken market share from HOOD … USDC has also taken shares from USDT since MiCA was effective in late December. We believe COIN could enter the prediction markets soon. The next step is S & P 500 inclusion, which could occur March 7 under our best-case scenario. … We believe Base, USDC, international expansion, derivatives and Coinbase One will likely take priorities, and will drive utility on payments, tokenization and decentralized Bitcoin-backed loans. Management welcomes competition because it expands the TAM, and considers trust and being crypto native its key moats."" JPMorgan raises price target to $344 from $264 Analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained his neutral rating on Coinbase, but remains optimistic in his 2026 earnings estimates ""nearly doubling"" after Thursday's results. ""The fourth quarter, and we would argue 2024 overall, was a pivotal and consequential period for the cryptoecosystem— market caps exploded, volumes jumped, new participants entered the market and regulatory confidence completely flipped. … Interesting to us is that the volume surge seen post election [has] largely remained intact, suggesting that this level of velocity, activity and revenue generation … could be sustainable."" Barclays raises price target to $328 from $282 Barclays maintained an equal weight rating on Coinbase while lifting its price target. Analyst Benjamin Budish highlighted strong first-quarter progress in the first six weeks of the year, and a good outlook. ""Unsurprisingly, the tone of the call was quite upbeat, with management outlining broad product and geographic ambitions, although we think the next catalyst — which is likely political/regulatory — may take some time to emerge (however, we also acknowledge the clear change in tone from D.C. and think this is a when, not an if). Given outperformance [Thursday] following HOOD's print (COIN +8% vs. S & P +1%), we are not very surprised to see shares flat-to-down in aftermarket trading, but given the Q1 progress, updated USDC market cap and a higher rate curve, among others, our estimates are up."" Raymond James, market perform, price target NM Analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy said the postelection backdrop ""created a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto and reawakened animal spirits,"" helping the company's fourth quarter performance. However: ""We have little confidence in the sustainability of current revenue and EBITDA momentum for several reasons. For example, more regulatory certainty is going to invite competition from non-crypto-native brokerage platforms which we expect to be a catalyst for price compression. In addition, much of [the] recent volume strength has come from memecoins which has proven to be transitory in the past. As such, we continue to expect eventual degradation of Coinbase's economics and have a cautious view of the firm's long-term earnings power."" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2025-02-14 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/coinbase-had-a-blowout-fourth-quarter-what-wall-street-is-saying.html,cnbc
"Robinhood's fourth-quarter crypto surge could bode well for Coinbase results, Needham says","Robinhood's fourth-quarter explosion in crypto revenue could signal strong results are in store for Coinbase , according to Needham. Robinhood, the stock and crypto brokerage, posted record profit for the fourth quarter thanks to a surge in trading activity during the postelection rally. Within its transaction-based revenue, the company posted a 700% year-over-year spike in revenue from crypto trading, and a more than 400% increase in crypto volumes. Shares of Robinhood jumped 12% on Thursday following the report, while Coinbase gained 6% in sympathy. ""We are expecting a strong Q4 from COIN after HOOD posted better than expected results,"" Needham analyst John Todaro said in a note Thursday. ""HOOD's crypto revenue increased … amidst a surge in retail activity in November and December and [management] expressed a high degree of confidence in 2025 stating that 'AI and Crypto' were main focus items,"" Todaro added. Todaro said he is focused on retail trading fees for Coinbase and commentary on activity for 2025, as well as stablecoin adoption and crypto legislation timelines. Analysts are expecting a blowout quarter from Coinbase, which likely benefited from the postelection crypto rally. They expect earnings per share to have surged more than 70% from the year-earlier period, per LSEG. Revenue is forecast to have nearly doubled. The company has been making efforts to diversify its revenue streams away from trading through services such as staking, stablecoins and custodial revenue. As of the third quarter of 2024, trading makes up 47.5% of its total revenue, with most of it coming from retail traders. However, Todaro is cautious on the current quarter, as the altcoin crash driven by a meme coin mania in January could weigh on February volumes and extend into the second quarter. If Robinhood's January crypto volumes, which suggest a 15% drop in the first quarter from the fourth, are any indication, then Coinbase could see weakness for February. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC on Thursday that although crypto snagged the headline from its financial results, it was a ""balanced"" and ""diversified quarter."" He emphasized that nine different business lines generated more than $100 million in annual revenue, with demand for trading in options, equities and futures in addition to crypto driving net deposits to more than $50 billion for the year.",2025-02-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/robinhoods-fourth-quarter-crypto-surge-could-bode-well-for-coinbase-results-needham-says.html,cnbc

Meme coins have taken center stage in 2025 after bitcoin quadrupled in price over the past two years, helped by the debut of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024 that went on to attract $40 billion in new money in their first year. The meme coin frenzy has been built not just on the promise of a new, pro-crypto presidential administration, but by President Donald Trump himself, who launched his own meme coin and signaled anyone else can do the same under the new regime. ""The surge in meme coins, record-breaking bitcoin ETF inflows, and retail speculation suggest excess optimism, historically a warning signal,"" analysts at BCA Research led by Juan Correa wrote in a report. ""Less fiscal policy than expected, moderating growth, and declining inflation could also create a less favorable macro environment for crypto in the coming months. While we remain long-term positive on bitcoin, we believe now is a prudent time to take profits and wait for a more attractive entry point."" Correa also noted that a ""furious spree of crypto ETF filings"" has been unleashed, including not just cryptocurrencies tied to the Solana and Ripple networks, but also some of the biggest meme coins, including dogecoin , BONK , and even the President's TRUMP coin . At the same time, with institutional investors embracing crypto, discussions around pension fund allocations and bitcoin price targets are ""reaching extreme levels,"" the BCA note said. ""We are concerned that this raging optimism is a sign that we are near a top,"" the analysts added.

BTC yield measures the percentage change in the ratio between Strategy's bitcoin holdings and its diluted shares outstanding. KBW also suggested that Strategy's addition to the benchmark S & P 500 index ""could be on the horizon"" after the company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's updated accounting standard in January that allows companies to recognize unrealized gains as part of their net income. Companies must show positive earnings in the latest quarter as well as the previous four quarters to be considered for inclusion in the S & P 500.

Wall Street analysts cheer greater clarity around MicroStrategy's bitcoin acquisition methods,"Bitcoin treasury pioneer MicroStrategy' s upbeat financial results Wednesday night has invigorated Wall Street about the direction of its unique crypto bet. The fourth quarter was ""one for the record books,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Joseph Vafi. The company, which will now be known as Strategy, announced its name and logo change along with the results. During the quarter, it made its largest-ever increase in bitcoin holdings, adding 195,250 bitcoins. The company reached a BTC yield of 48% in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.1% in the third quarter. It also got ahead of schedule on its three-year plan to raise $42 billion – $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed income – and buy an equivalent amount in bitcoin. In the fourth quarter, it issued $16.7 billion in equity – about 80% of the $21 billion target – and $3.6 billion in fixed income securities. Management said that as a result, the company will emphasize fixed income issuance this year. ""While some may see the company's BTC acquisition strategy as risky, we see an emerging and rational cadence to acquisition activity here: exploiting periods of very high demand with heightened acquisition activity, while still consistently being buyers during periods of more normalized demand,"" Vafi said. The company also introduced two new metrics to gauge its ability to acquire bitcoin in an accretive manner: BTC Gain, which is the number of bitcoins the company has at the beginning of a period multiplied by the BTC yield for the period; and BTC $Gain, which takes the BTC Gain metric and translates its value into dollars based on the market price of bitcoin as 4 p.m. ET on the last day of the quarter.

""Given the significant number of BTCs that MSTR holds, the BTC gain of $10bn is nominally very large,"" said Mizuho's Dan Dolev, who has an outperform rating on the stock. ""This is evidence of MSTR's first mover advantage and scale relative to other companies that may attempt to deploy similar BTC strategies."" Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch noted the company would need to raise about $19 billion at a premium of 110%, which he said is doable. ""With our view that 2025 will be a good year for bitcoin (both seasonality and regulatory/political tailwinds), we believe this is feasible,"" he said.

Tariff concerns could dampen one of bitcoin's strongest months of the year,"Investors are bracing for volatility in February and scrambling to position themselves for a global trade war. Bitcoin is entering one of its strongest months of the year. It's finished in the green in all but two Februarys since 2013 and has an average return of 14% during the month over that period, according to CoinGlass. It finished January up 9%. This year, investors are entering February with an array of positive news that should give them comfort through any upcoming macro driven volatility. Bitcoin's price action, however, may not be as upbeat as usual. ""A dark cloud in the form of sweeping tariffs has descended over bitcoin and crypto at the start of February, which puts at risk its label as one of bitcoin's favorite months,"" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo. Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said uncertainty about tariffs, which come with inflation risks, could add pressure to bitcoin and Coinbase over the next few weeks. ""This may become a prolonged trade war and adds to concern about an economic downturn,"" he said. However, ""it doesn't look like it can be resolved in February, so it is likely that the industry will be under pressure for the month."" Bitcoin fell over the weekend after Trump signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a 10% duty on goods from China, but it recouped some of those losses once the U.S. agreed Monday to pause duties on Mexico and Canada. ""Further chop can't be ruled out in this uncertain geopolitical environment, and we won't be able to say that bitcoin has moved through that fogginess until it clears $110,000,"" Trenchev said. ""A reticent Federal Reserve is another reason not to throw caution to the wind as we parse each piece of economic data over the next six weeks ahead of the next FOMC meeting."" ""Crypto investors should sit back and take stock of the plethora of positive news that crypto enjoyed in January,"" he added. ""The industry didn't get everything it wanted (e.g. a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) but we now reside in a crypto friendly environment in the U.S. and that opens the door to innovation, regulatory clarity and a favorable price backdrop."" Last month, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler left his post and President Donald Trump tapped Commissioner Mark Uyeda, a crypto industry ally, as interim chair until Paul Atkins is confirmed to the role. Uyeda will be leading a crypto task force to develop clear industry regulations. The SEC also repealed the SAB 121 accounting rule, which required financial institutions to treat cryptocurrencies as a liability on their balance sheets. And finally, Trump signed an executive order on crypto, with parameters for how the industry can continue to operate and flourish in the U.S. Four days into the new month, Trump has signed another executive order outlining plans for a government-run sovereign wealth fund, which crypto enthusiasts are speculating would be the kind of fund that could house the government's confiscated cryptocurrency holdings. On Tuesday, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee proposed new rules for stablecoins. This afternoon, crypto and AI czar David Sacks is holding a press conference where he's expected to reveal several crypto-related plans and developments. Grayscale head of research Zach Pandl acknowledged that there is some industry disappointment in Trump's executive order on crypto, which called for planning around a strategic bitcoin reserve rather than outright launching one. Outside of that topic, however, the order gave the industry all the clarity it needed to be confident that the Trump administration is going to support crypto development in the U.S., he said. ""The market has not fully reacted to the executive order and its implications for the industry,"" Pandl said. ""So in February, I would expect the longer run implications of Trump's executive order to sink in for crypto investors and potentially get new investors to deploy capital in the asset."" Still, he warned, higher tariffs and uncertainty about AI valuations could weigh on the equity market ""for some time,"" which could pull down cryptocurrency prices. ""Investors are likely to reduce risk across the board, including in crypto,"" he said. ""However, bitcoin is a global asset and not directly affected by higher tariffs. Moreover, extensive use of tariffs could further fragment the dollar-based global financial system, possibly leading trading partners to seek alternative money and payment systems.""",2025-02-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/bitcoin-february-outlook.html,cnbc
Crypto has become a 'money grab' since latest Trump-fueled rise of meme coins,"Electing a pro-cryptocurrency president was more than most investors ever thought possible. Almost three months after the election, however, the initial euphoria is fading and turning to alarm for those who worry that President Trump's own moves into crypto could be sowing the seeds of the next crypto winter. Just last month, Trump dropped the ""only official Trump meme coin."" According to Chainalysis, nearly half of those who bought the token – or the Melania meme coin released the next day – were likely new investors who created their first crypto wallets the same day. But as much as investors look forward to a bull market capital injection, the industry is also trying to mature and distance itself from its online casino reputation, making allocation of new capital to projects with long-term utility and value all the more vital. Otherwise, today's meme coin mania may well result in losses, discourage new crypto investors and hold back more valuable companies and developments. ""It's a money grab,"" said Tyrone Ross, founder and president of registered investment advisor 401 Financial. ""I wish a lot of this time and effort was spent on building out the technology and making it more accessible, but that gets farther and farther away with every announcement."" Coins questioned While companies like Coinbase Global and Robinhood Markets may benefit in the short run from the trading frenzy, JMP Citizens analyst Devin Ryan said meme coins aren't an important part of a serious investable thesis. Instead, the opportunities come from coins' ability to help people use blockchain technology in new ways, for example in staking , stablecoin utilization, integration with payments, web3 , the use of digital wallets and the tokenization of traditional financial assets. But those ambitions could get derailed. Only this week, Trump Media announced its latest push into crypto : TruthFi, a financial services division that will invest up to $250 million in exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies and other assets, and launch products and services, including its own investment vehicles, later this year. ""People are going to be knocking each other over to get investment from them,"" Ross said of TruthFi. ""It's just more products in the space, which is the last thing we need."" Since last summer, Trump's companies have debuted two non-fungible token, or NFT , collections: Trump Digital Trading Cards on the Polygon blockchain and Trump Bitcoin Digital Trading Cards on the Bitcoin blockchain. A decentralized finance , or DeFi, platform called World Liberty Financial has also been launched on Ethereum. That company has since made major purchases of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) , ether , Tron's TRX , AAVE , Ethena's ENA and Chainlink's LINK . Trump's influence is already affecting trading and investing trends. Last week, the Coinbase CEO posted on X that the company is having to rethink its listing process ""given there are ~1 million tokens a week being created now, and growing."" Bitwise Asset Management has filed to launch an ETF tracking the price of the longest reigning meme coin, dogecoin , and Grayscale has introduced a dogecoin trust. There's also a Trump meme coin ETF in the works. Ross argues that the flurry of announcements doesn't ""help move the space forward … It's just a new casino."" Crypto has been through these crazes before (especially in 2017 and 2021) and has always bounced back to new heights. Blockchain setback The problem now is the industry has yet to prove to the wider world that blockchain technology is useful on a mass scale for anything other than speculative trading. And on the heels of a banner year for crypto — the start of trading in bitcoin ETFs a year ago was the flagship coin's ""IPO moment,"" and the funds have seen strong institutional demand since — some view the current market as a setback to that progress. ""There's a dilution effect going on in the sense that there are so many of these [coins] being launched that it does make it harder for crypto projects to maintain value,"" said Steven Lubka, head of private clients and family offices at Swan Bitcoin. That's only serving to separate bitcoin from everything else digital. Historically, when bitcoin runs to new records, it lifts the rest of the crypto market. But altcoins have been struggling for months, even after the postelection bitcoin rally. ""Bitcoin has impressively held above $100,000 [even] as most coins continue to give back the massive gains made in the last two months of 2024,"" Wolfe Research analyst Rob Ginsberg wrote in a note last week. ""While we reiterate that the longer-term direction of the space is up and to the right, the next few months are setting up to be more challenging. We would recommend trimming exposure to altcoins and parking it in bitcoin until near term trends improve."" Dilutive bear market Similarly, Lubka at Swan Bitcoin said altcoin investors have ""basically been in a bear market"" largely due to ""rapid dilution."" ""There are just constantly new things being pumped into the market, and traders and investors have been rotating very rapidly,"" he said. ""It's been a very hostile environment."" But long-term investors focused on bitcoin only need not worry about the effect of these distractions on the price, Lubka added. ""Not only does it not hurt bitcoin … it's actually maybe positive for bitcoin,"" he said. ""The extent to which the crypto industry decides to throw itself upon this fate of just being meme coins and gambling … I think it'll only drive more capital to bitcoin."" —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2025-02-01 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/01/crypto-has-become-a-money-grab-since-latest-trump-fueled-rise-of-meme-coins.html,cnbc
"This bitcoin miner is trading at a 'deep discount' following the tech rout earlier this week, says Bernstein","Bitcoin miners were some of the hardest hit in the DeepSeek scare earlier this week, and one of Bernstein's favorite names is now available at a ""deep discount."" Core Scientific , a leader among bitcoin miners chasing artificial intelligence deals, lost about 30% in the sell-off. It is now 42% off Bernstein's $17 price target on the stock. ""Our top pick, CORZ offers ready 'power access' and data center buildout to HPC cloud partners such as CoreWeave, who in turn are contracted by hyperscalers and AI labs,"" analyst Gautam Chhugani said in a note Thursday. ""Bitcoin miners are the second derivative of the AI capex story."" ""We are inclined to believe bitcoin miners have a 12-18 month finite window to build a hybrid data center business, while the hyperscaler capex remains persistent,"" he added. ""CORZ is the leader of the pack."" CORZ 5D mountain Core Scientific is trading at a ""deep discount"" after the DeepSeek scare, according to Bernstein. Core Scientific came out of bankruptcy about a year ago and inked its $6.7 billion partnership with Nvidia-backed AI startup CoreWeave in August. That gave it a first-mover advantage over other ""hybrid"" bitcoin miners, according to Chhugani. Most publicly traded bitcoin miners have chased the same trend, making them so-called hybrid miners, or those that operate both a bitcoin mining business and an AI business. Chhugani said that after the correction, at an enterprise value of $2.7 million per megawatt, Core is trading closer to pure-play bitcoin mining valuations than data center valuations, despite 70% of its capacity being allocated to AI. Pure-play bitcoin miners such as Mara Holdings and CleanSpark average about $1.5 million per megawatt, while data center companies such as Equinix and Iron Mountain average $34 million per megawatt. Analysts from Piper Sandler and Cantor Fitzgerald said in notes earlier this week that the DeepSeek-driven sell-off is overdone and creating good buying opportunities in bitcoin miners. H.C. Wainwright has a contrarian view on miners' near-term monetization opportunities for AI, however.

"Beware of a 'self-fulfilling' sell-off if bitcoin returns to $90,000, says Standard Chartered","Bitcoin staged a big reversal this week, climbing above $99,000 Wednesday, two days after dipping below $90,000 in a macro-driven sell-off . If the cryptocurrency drops below that key support level again, however, forced or panic selling could invite even steeper declines, according to Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. ""A clean break below $90,000 (beyond the temporary dip seen on Jan. 13) could see bitcoin break to the low $80,000s, driving a further 10% decline in digital assets across the board,"" he wrote in the note. ""Once such a retracement runs its course, we would recommend accumulating longs again."" Most bitcoin sales ""in the past few days"" have come at a loss and 14% of bitcoins are being held at a loss, Kendrick pointed out. Additionally, purchases of bitcoin ETFs and spot bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy since the U.S. presidential election are only now breaking even – given average buy prices of $94,000 for ETFs and $93,000 for MicroStrategy. The ""risk of mark-to-market pain is building"" and ""can cause a sell-off to become self-fulfilling,"" he said. If bitcoin sees that extra drop toward $80,000, bitcoin ETFs could log new record daily outflows exceeding $1 billion, he said. The worst day of outflows to date was Jan. 8, when bitcoin ETFs recorded $583 million of outflows. The post-election crypto rally fizzled into the end of 2024 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sounded an inflation warning on Dec. 18, and bitcoin suffered even steeper losses last week as a spike in bond yields prompted investors to dump growth-oriented risk assets. Bitcoin briefly dropped below $90,000 on Monday, but bounced above $96,000 Tuesday around a light inflation reading. It rose to $99,000 Wednesday after another encouraging inflation report and strong bank assets further stoked investors' appetite for risk assets. Kendrick reiterated his view that bitcoin could reach $200,000 this year, as institutional inflows resume under the incoming pro-crypto administration. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",2025-01-15 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/15/beware-of-a-self-fulfilling-sell-off-if-bitcoin-returns-to-90000-says-standard-chartered-.html,cnbc
Two Trump crypto trades are coming into conflict and could prove a headwind to the bitcoin rally,"Bitcoin investors could suffer a turbulent quarter, as two opposing Trump crypto trades come into conflict. The price of bitcoin is heading for its worst week since September after concerns about President-elect Trump's tariff plans, plus the latest stronger-than-expected payroll numbers, caused a spike in bond yields, boosting the dollar while pressuring bitcoin and other risk assets. Although the postelection crypto rally had fizzled by the end of 2024, investor sentiment was still optimistic coming into 2025. The promise of a pro-crypto Congress and White House outweighed any concern about macroeconomic-related speedbumps. Drop first, then rebound But as investors start to make sense of what Trump's first 100 days could look like, it's becoming clearer that the bitcoin price could drop further before attempting its next record. A pro-crypto government under Trump may continue to support the digital asset class this year, but other aspects of his agenda could actually work against prices in the near term. ""Bitcoin's problem at the moment is the strong dollar,"" said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments. ""Part of it is the signal that we got from the Federal Reserve, that they're going to be slower on rate cuts … but I would attribute the drawdown in the last two days largely to the market starting to appreciate that not every aspect of the Trump policy agenda is going to be positive for bitcoin – and tariffs do introduce some new uncertainty."" At the beginning of the week, bitcoin responded favorably to a Washington Post report that the scope of the Trump administration's tariff plans might be limited. Two days later, however, Trump was reportedly contemplating the use of emergency measures to implement wide-reaching tariffs. The dollar gained against most other currencies, and appreciated further when Treasury yields touched 14-month highs Friday. ""Since the Federal Reserve did its hawkish cut in December, risk takers have been jumpy and sensitive to hot data on jobs, services, and prices,"" said Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital. ""Couple that with uncertainty about President-elect Trump's forthcoming trade and tariff agenda, and it's possible risk assets will face choppiness over the near term, despite long-term structural tailwinds for bitcoin and digital assets remaining intact."" Bitcoin's correlations with stocks and gold tend to fluctuate, but it has two more persistent historical correlations: a positive one with global liquidity ( measured by M2 , a gauge of broad money supply), and a negative one with the dollar index. H.C. Wainwright crypto and blockchain analyst Mike Colonnese noted last week that M2 has been trending lower since October and that could lead to bitcoin retracing to the mid-$70,000 range sometime in the current quarter. Analysts like JPMorgan's Kenneth Worthington have also pointed out that the legislative process on Capitol Hill is slow, and any positive policy impact may not be felt until the end of the year. ""Especially over the next three months, when Congress is going to be dealing primarily with non-crypto issues, it's going to be a more macro driven market,"" Pandl at Grayscale said. ""Eventually we're going to get to crypto legislation on stablecoins and market structure – we should feel confident that this Congress is going to take up those issues – but there are big ticket items that need to be dealt with first,"" like immigration, taxes and tariffs, he said. Bitcoin soared more than 45% in the month after the Nov. 5 presidential election, helped by Trump's pro-crypto promises and the industry spending millions of dollars to help elect the most pro-crypto Congress ever, before sliding in December. ""The idea that we're going to have a pro-crypto Congress and a pro-crypto legislative environment and that's going to be quite supportive for the asset class – I very much believe that,"" Pandl added. ""But aspects of the Trump agenda can also be positive for the dollar [and] introduce risk to markets, and tariffs are really the key example of that.""",2025-01-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/10/two-trump-crypto-trades-are-in-conflict-and-could-derail-the-bitcoin-rally.html,cnbc
MicroStrategy trades like a meme stock these days. What investors need to know,"Investors have compared MicroStrategy to meme stocks in recent weeks as the data visualization and reporting platform piled into bitcoin at the end of last year, even as the cryptocurrency hit record after record. MicroStrategy, seen as a proxy for the price of bitcoin, benefited in the post-election bitcoin rally. Fueled by its five-year-old strategy of loading up on crypto, MicroStrategy, based in suburban Virginia outside Washington, soared 58% in November alone. Then the company co-founded by Michael Saylor gave back 25% in December as the crypto rally faded, but still soared 358% in 2024, one of the best performing stocks of the year. It even joined the Nasdaq-100 index, gaining inclusion in the heavily traded Invesco QQQ Trust exchange traded fund. MSTR 1Y mountain MicroStrategy, 1 year The combination of a sky-high stock price, surging popularity and a crypto-native cheering section on social media is leading some to question if MicroStrategy might really go the way of a meme stock —popular among retail investors on social media but risky and vulnerable to sharp downdrafts. Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Co. who rates MicroStrategy a buy, attributes this view to a lack of understanding of MicroStrategy's novel bitcoin-buying strategy. ""Anytime a new approach is taken in technology or on Wall Street, there are going to be skeptics who are rooted in the traditional ways of doing things who will say this new strategy is not sustainable,"" Palmer told CNBC. ""What we are seeing in terms of skepticism, with regard to Michael Saylor's approach, is not only understandable, it was almost inevitable given the way that adoption signals typically work."" Church of bitcoin Saylor, today the company's executive chairman, is a staunch bitcoin advocate and educator. He doesn't shy from media interviews, industry events or any opportunity to deliver a sermon explaining why bitcoin is the premier asset class and engage with the crypto lovers and haters alike – at one point in December, even addressing a Microsoft shareholder meeting . His social media is filled with rocket ship emojis and images of him as a sort of religious icon for the church of Bitcoin. ""What Michael Saylor has done over the past few years is draw attention to what MicroStrategy is doing by embracing social media and meme culture, so he has not balked at the notion of promoting MicroStrategy using over the top memes and things of that nature,"" Palmer said. ""I think he would view that as part of his role as an evangelist for bitcoin and MicroStrategy."" MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020. At the time, the strategy was ""defensive in nature,"" Palmer said. In the past year the approach became more offensive, with the company raising billions of dollars through the sale of convertible bonds for the sole purpose of buying more bitcoin. In 2024, MicroStrategy bought bitcoin 18 times, the last eight after the November presidential election. Today, it holds 446,400 bitcoins on its balance sheet, about 2% of the world's total bitcoin supply. But with bitcoin's notorious volatility, there's concern that it will be worth less by the time the MicroStrategy debt comes due. However, the notes aren't due until 2029, and there's never been a five-year period in which the price of bitcoin was lower on any given day than five years prior, said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a maker of tools for a network that enables apps and contracts for bitcoin. Surviving big hits Benchmark's Palmer acknowledge that because MicroStrategy trades so closely with bitcoin, it's likely to take a big hit when bitcoin does – and bitcoin is no stranger to 30% drawdowns even in a bull market. Historically, bitcoin has pulled back as much as 80% from the cycle peak. But MicroStrategy has already lived through a bitcoin bear market – it dropped 74% in 2022 alongside bitcoin's 64% slump – and Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy survived it. ""There are definitely external factors, macroeconomic factors, that could cause MicroStrategy to adjust its approach but as we have seen – particularly at the end of 2022 – even when the crypto markets have been in disarray and there were skeptics screaming that crypto is dead, the company was able to preserve its optionality,"" Palmer said. ""There was no trigger, no catalyst, that was able to completely undermine what it was doing. MicroStrategy went through that, came out the other side and was able to embark on an even more aggressive approach to what it was doing during the second half of 2024,"" he added. Accelerated adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors and corporations alike, driven by expected regulatory reform of crypto in 2024, could drive bitcoin as high as $225,000 this year, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright, a 156-year-old investment bank, said last week. That's likely to translate into even more aggressive purchases by MicroStrategy. Saylor has likened buying bitcoin to investing in Manhattan real estate, saying his company will ""keep buying the top forever.""",2025-01-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/04/microstrategy-trades-like-a-meme-stock-what-investors-need-to-know.html,cnbc

"Paramount ends DEI policies, cites Trump executive order","Paramount Global told its employees this week that it's ending numerous diversity, equity and inclusion policies, according to a memo obtained by CNBC.

In the memo sent to employees Wednesday, Paramount said it would comply with President Donald Trump's executive order banning the practice in the federal government and demanding that agencies investigate private companies over their DEI programs.

Co-CEOs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins cited the executive order in the memo, as well as the Supreme Court and federal mandates, as the impetus for the media giant's policy changes.

Among the changes, the company said it ""will no longer set or use aspirational numerical goals related to the race, ethnicity, sex or gender of hires."" Paramount also said it ended its policy of collecting such stats for its U.S. job applicants on forms and career pages, except in the markets where it's legally required to do so.

""To be the best storytellers and to continue to drive success, we must have a highly talented, dedicated and creative workforce that reflects the perspectives and experiences of our many different audiences. Values like inclusivity and collaboration are a part of the Paramount culture and will continue to be,"" the co-CEOs wrote in the memo.

They added that they will continue to evaluate their policies and seek talent from all backgrounds.

Paramount has taken part in a number of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. It donated millions to racial justice causes in 2020 after the police murder of George Floyd and has touted initiatives such as a supplier diversity program and Content for Change, a campaign to overhaul storytelling about racial equity and mental health. The company has hosted an annual Inclusion Week for years and maintains an Office of Global Inclusion.

""Diversity, equity and inclusion is fundamental to our business,"" former CEO Bob Bakish said at Paramount's 2023 Inclusion Week, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Paramount joins companies like Walmart , Target and Amazon in rolling back their DEI goals and policies in recent months. Others, like Apple and Costco, have publicly defended and committed to their DEI stances, even as the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on the practices.

Media companies have taken a variety of steps to respond to the Trump administration's policy changes since the president's inauguration last month.

Also this week, Warner Bros. Discovery executives told employees that the company will be rebranding its DEI efforts as ""inclusion"" and updating its website to reflect the change, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. They also said Warner Bros. Discovery will no longer participate in third-party workplace surveys and will have a ""uniform and consistent application process"" for their development programs.

Earlier this month, Disney changed its DEI programs, which included updating performance factors and rebranding initiatives and employee resource groups, among other things.

Around the same time, public broadcaster PBS — which, as a recipient of federal funding, is more directly affected by Trump's order than corporations are — said it would shut down its DEI office. CNBC reported that DEI employees would exit the company in order for it to stay in compliance with Trump's executive order.

Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission began investigating Comcast over its DEI efforts. Trump's executive order, signed on his first day in office, directs federal agencies to identify and probe ""most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners"" in their sectors. Comcast previously said in a statement it would cooperate with the investigation.

"WBD adds 6.4 million Max subscribers, forecasts 150 million subs by end of 2026","A sign outside of the Warner Brothers Discovery Techwood Turner Broadcasting campus is seen on June 26, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Thursday it added 6.4 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter for a total of 116.9 million subscribers.

Fourth-quarter revenue for the streaming segment, which is anchored by flagship service Max, totaled $2.65 billion, up 5% from $2.53 billion in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the unit came in at $409 million, compared with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

In a shareholder letter, the media and entertainment company forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for its streaming business for the year — roughly double the $677 million adjusted EBITDA it reported for 2024 — and said it has a ""clear path"" to hit 150 million global subscribers by the end of 2026. Max is set to launch on television service Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the second quarter of 2026, and will debut in Germany and Italy in the first quarter of that year.

""In this generational media disruption, only the global streamers will survive and prosper, and Max is just that,"" CEO David Zaslav said on the company's earnings call Thursday.

WBD announced Wednesday that Max would keep its B/R Sports and CNN content available at no additional cost to subscribers in its standard and premium tiers. Initially WBD planned to charge an additional cost for sports.

However, it will pull both verticals from its basic, ad-supported tier beginning March 30.

On the earnings call, JB Perrette, CEO and president of global streaming and games, said the company would continue to experiment with its news and sports business models.

While sports have increased their presence on streaming services recently, with platforms like Netflix adding to their live sports portfolios, Zaslav said the company is more focused on maximizing its returns than acquiring more sports content.

Warner Bros. Discovery is losing U.S. distribution rights to National Basketball Association games starting next season. It still has a U.S. sports portfolio that includes the French Open, Major League Baseball, college football and the National Hockey League.

Three women on the list are running philanthropic organizations, and there are two women recognized for their achievements in government.

This group of women includes a dozen startup founders leading companies with a total combined valuation of more than $11 billion, and they've raised more than $2 billion from investors. The nine public company CEOs on the list run organizations with a combined market capitalization of about $385 billion.

The second annual CNBC Changemakers list of women who are transforming business and philanthropy, which launched on Monday, recognizes leaders whose accomplishments span many fields and innovations: biotech breakthroughs, AI advances, women's health, and new products and services, many focused on female consumers. Each has accomplished a meaningful achievement in 2024, propelling a major business to a new level of growth or tackling an essential societal issue.

Remaking food for a healthier diet with: Once Upon a Farm's Jennifer Garner and Partake Foods' Denise Woodard Leading the AI race in the markets with: Google DeepMind's Lila Ibrahim , Accenture's Lan Guan and Aily Labs' Bianca Anghelina

In putting together this list, CNBC identified a couple of key trends. Like last year's inaugural list, these leaders are pursuing purpose along with profits, creating businesses whose success is aligned with social or environmental good.

Toyin Ajayi, CEO of Cityblock Health, co-founded the health-care provider to improve the health of lower-income communities, by offering not just medical care, but also mental health, and help navigating social services.

Honest Company CEO Carla Vernón is pursuing the company's mission to make sustainably-designed and cleanly-formulated products accessible to parents.

Cassandra Morales Thurswell created plastic-free shampoo bars to make affordable hair care, also sustainable.

And Emma Grede, founding partner and chief product officer of Skims, co-founded Good American, a size-inclusive brand, to give an underserved market more options, and she's using her platform to drive change. She's chairman of The Fifteen Percent Pledge, a nonprofit working with retailers to dedicate 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned businesses.

Another key trend: Women tackling health-care needs, often their own. Stripes Beauty founder and chief creative officer Naomi Watts is leading a transformation in the way women talk about and treat menopause. Joanna Strober's startup, Midi Health, offers a virtual clinic, including hormonal and non-hormonal medications, along with supplements and lifestyle coaching, for women aged 40-plus. These two women are tapping a market with enormous potential.

Other Changemakers are focusing on giving consumers more information about their bodies. Katherine Stueland is CEO of GeneDX, which provides genomics testing to help with diagnosis, treatment, and drug discovery, while Michal Mor and Merav Mor, twin sisters and triathletes, co-founded Lumen to measure and track metabolism to provide personalized nutrition.

While most leaders are focused on AI, this group of Changemakers is on the cutting edge, not just of AI development, but also its safe and practical implementation. Lila Ibrahim, chief operating officer of Google DeepMind, is working to ensure that AI is deployed, not just responsibly, but as a force for good, to find medical breakthroughs. Meanwhile Aily Labs' Bianca Anghelina is building tools to improve corporate decision-making, and Accenture's chief AI officer, Lan Guan, helps the firm's thousands of clients develop customized AI strategies. In 2024, Guan led the fastest growth in an emerging technology in Accenture's history, booking $3 billion in generative AI-related business for the firm.

Our goal in launching the Changemakers list last year was to highlight leaders who have defied the odds. Women comprise 11% of Fortune 500 CEOs, and that's a record high. As a result, nearly all of the women on the list come from Fortune 500 industries or sectors where women are severely underrepresented in CEO roles. Some, such as Taylor Morrison CEO Sheryl Palmer, are the only female CEOs in their sector. Palmer has embraced the distinction, leveraging her position to create opportunities for other women. Taylor Morrison says the company's female workforce reached 44% in March of 2024, four times the construction industry average.

Palmer's employee base illustrates a trend: female leaders are more likely to have more women reporting to them in leadership roles and a diverse workforce. And this is true of this year's Changemakers: 29 other women on the list say at least half their workforce is female. And 30 say at least half their direct reports are women.

Outside of the Fortune 500, women face an uphill climb as well. Venture capital funding to female-founded companies has actually declined, to 2% last year, while companies with female and male co-founders drew nearly 21%. (That means all-male founding teams drew over 77% of all VC dollars last year). And there is data showing that the progress women are making to close gender gaps in leadership is ""fragile,"" as Sheryl Sandberg warned after the LeanIn/McKinsey report found a weak pipeline into CEO roles.

The women who succeed, despite those odds, are by definition, exceptional, and their stories, which reveal grit, perseverance, and creativity, are an inspiration. We will be celebrating these Changemakers on April 8 in Los Angeles. Please join me there for a series of interviews and conversations about leadership, innovation, understanding consumers, how to lead culture, and strategize for the future.

Our lineup for the April 8 Summit includes some of this year's Changemakers: Donna Langley, chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios; Paris Hilton, founder, CEO 11:11 media; Chelsea Hirschhorn, founder and CEO of baby, pregnancy and fertility product company Frida; TIAA's CEO of Retirement Solutions, Kourtney Gibson; education company Guild's CEO Bijal Shah, and Merav and Michal Mor, the co-founders and inventors of Lumen.",2025-02-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/cnbc-changemakers-how-success-formula-is-evolving-for-women-leaders.html,cnbc

New York Knicks fans who get Altice USA 's Optimum cable service will once again be able to see their favorite National Basketball Association team play live games.

MSG Networks has reached a deal with the fourth-largest U.S. cable provider to bring back the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York Rangers, New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres and New Jersey Devils. Service has been restored in time for the Rangers vs. Sabres game at 5:30 pm E.T.

""MSG Networks and Altice USA today are pleased to announce that they have reached an agreement for the relaunch of MSG Networks on Optimum video lineups,"" the companies said in a statement. ""MSG Networks and Altice USA would like to thank everyone for their patience as we partnered to reach this new agreement to benefit our fans and Optimum subscribers.""

Specific terms of the agreement weren't released. The deal gives Altice USA the option of moving MSG Networks onto its ""Everything TV"" tier for new and existing customers, which costs $140 per month, according to a person familiar with the matter. Altice USA now offers skinnier bundles that don't include sports for less money.

Altice USA is paying a smaller carriage fee for MSG Networks than it previously had paid, according to a person familiar with the contract. Spokespeople for Altice USA and MSG networks declined to comment beyond the statement.

Comcast and NBCUniversal receive FCC inquiry on DEI initiatives,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks to Brendan Carr, his intended pick for Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as he attends a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas.

The Federal Communications Commission has alerted Comcast Corp. that it will begin an investigation into the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at the media giant.

The FCC, the agency that regulates the media and telecommunications industry, said in a letter dated Tuesday that it would open the inquiry into both Comcast — which provides broadband, mobile and cable TV services under the Xfinity brand — and NBCUniversal, the media arm that encompasses the company's broadcast and cable TV networks, streaming app Peacock, and Universal film studio and amusement parks.

The letter comes three weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order looking to end DEI practices at U.S. corporations. The order calls for each federal agency to ""identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations"" among publicly traded companies, as well as nonprofits and other institutions.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican who was recently appointed by Trump, said he was starting his investigation with Comcast and NBCUniversal because they ""cover a range of sectors regulated by the FCC.""

""We have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions,"" a Comcast spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. ""For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.""

Carr said in the letter sent to Comcast that he was ""concerned that Comcast and NBCUniversal may be promoting invidious forms of DEI in a manner that does not comply with FCC regulations.""

The letter goes on to say that ""Comcast states on its website that promoting DEI is 'a core value of our business' and public reports state that Comcast has an entire 'DEI infrastructure' that includes annual 'DEI day[s],' 'DEI training for company leaders,' and similar initiatives."" The letter says NBCUniversal has similar initiatives, ""including executives specifically dedicated to promoting DEI across the TV and programming side of the business.""

Later on Wednesday, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks issued a statement condemning the investigation and requesting to receive more information. He noted that when Carr was a commissioner himself, he ""blasted the prior administration for acting in a way that 'gives the FCC a nearly limitless power to veto private sector decision.'""

""From what I know this enforcement action is out of our lane and out of our reach. I have asked for a briefing to understand the Enforcement Bureau's theory of the case, the authority relied upon and any prior precedent. This action gives me grave concern,"" Starks said in a statement.

An FCC representative didn't immediately respond for comment regarding the statement from Starks.

Fellow media giant Disney is changing its DEI programs, which includes updating performance factors and rebranding initiatives and employee resource groups, among other things, the company confirmed Wednesday.

Public broadcaster PBS is shutting down its DEI office. A PBS representative confirmed that those employees were leaving the company, noting it was to stay in compliance with Trump's executive order.

""We will continue to adhere to our mission and values. PBS will continue to reflect all of America and remain a welcoming place for everyone,"" the broadcaster said in a statement.

"Denver Broncos President Damani Leech praises NFL's diversity commitment as corporate America, government roll back DEI","""I think we've all been hired in the last three to four years,"" Leech told CNBC Sport from Radio Row in New Orleans ahead of Super Bowl 59. ""So I think the progress that the league has made there is pretty tremendous.""

Earlier this week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell backed the league's inclusive hiring practices, such as the Rooney Rule, a policy instituted in 2003 that requires teams to interview minority candidates for certain coaching and executive positions.

""I think we've proven to ourselves that it does make the NFL better,"" Goodell said this week. ""We're not in this because it's a trend to get into it or a trend to get out of it. Our efforts are fundamental in trying to attract the best possible talent into the National Football League both on and off the field.""

Leech echoed the commissioner's viewpoints. He joined the Broncos after spending three years as chief operating officer of NFL International from 2019 to 2022.

""I view diversity as a weapon,"" said Leech. ""I think you're trying to get the best talent in the room, whether that's on the field or off the field. And folks who don't do that, I think they'll do it at their expense. I think for us, we try to get the best talent we can, regardless of where you're from. I think that our differences make us better. That's both at a club level and at a league level.""

Leech's comments come as a range of major corporations roll back their DEI hiring practices. Last month, the Trump administration also directed all federal DEI staff be put on paid leave before many lose their jobs.",2025-02-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/denver-broncos-president-damani-leech-praises-nfl-diversity-commitment.html,cnbc
Former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees hints at return to broadcasting,"Brees signed a multiyear contract with NBC Sports in 2020, but only spent a year as an NFL studio analyst before leaving the role in what then-head of NBC Sports Pete Bevacqua called a ""lifestyle choice"" for Brees.

Former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees said he'd like to join an NFL broadcast team as a game analyst, and hinted he's already in talks with media companies for a role.

Fox reveals plans to launch subscription streaming service this year,"A Fox News sign is seen on a television vehicle outside the News Corporation building in New York City, Nov. 8, 2017.

Fox Corp . is finally getting into the direct-to-consumer streaming game.

The company known for its news and sports TV content said Tuesday it's aiming to launch a subscription streaming service by the end of the year.

The streaming service is not meant to upend Fox's place in the traditional bundle, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said on the company's quarterly earnings call. Murdoch offered few details on the streaming service beyond the high-level announcement. He said the company is designing the app now, and further information will be released in the coming months.

Fox's upcoming streaming option is expected to include both its sports and news content, Murdoch said.

Unlike its legacy media competitors, Fox has so far been on the sidelines of streaming, with the exception of the Fox Nation streaming app, which includes exclusive programming to the service and on-demand Fox News primetime shows, and its free, ad-supported service Tubi. Fox, which will broadcast the Super Bowl on Sunday, is also offering the NFL's biggest game on Tubi for the first time ever.

However, the late move into subscription-based streaming comes after Fox, alongside Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney, in January dropped efforts to launch a joint venture sports streaming app called Venu.

The three companies had planned to pool together all of their sports content and offer it on the Venu streaming service. However, following legal hurdles that delayed the original fall 2024 launch date, the companies called off their plans.

Out of the three partners, Fox was the only one without another option to offer its sports content outside of the cable TV bundle. Warner Bros. Discovery offers its live sports content on streamer Max. Disney's ESPN has its ESPN+ app and is developing a separate direct-to-consumer ESPN streamer. The company is targeting an August launch of ESPN ""Flagship,"" the unofficial name of the all-inclusive ESPN service.

Fox's Murdoch referred to the end of Venu as the company's ""only disappointment in sports.""

Fox has focused its strategy on sports and news content after selling its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019. The company has reported stable viewership and advertising revenue, even during the recent ad market slump. Live sports and news remain the highest-rated content in the traditional TV bundle, even as consumers cut the cord for streaming alternatives.

""We're huge supporters of the traditional cable bundle, and we always will be,"" Murdoch said on Tuesday's call. ""But having said that, we do want to reach consumers wherever they are, and there's a large population, obviously, that are now outside of the traditional cable bundle.""

He said the company's subscriber expectations ""will be modest, and we're going to price the service accordingly."" He added Fox doesn't intend to convert any traditional cable TV customers into streaming customers with the app.

Murdoch said the company doesn't ""expect to have any exclusive rights costs or additional incremental rights costs"" and will simply package its existing content. This means the costs of creating and distributing the platform will be ""relatively low,"" especially when compared with competitors.

In addition to shelling out billions for original entertainment programming, media companies have been spending big on exclusive sports media rights for their streaming platforms. In many cases, exclusive live sports have helped to drive subscriber and ad revenue growth for streamers.

On Tuesday, Murdoch also noted the recent rise of so-called skinny packages from traditional pay TV distributors, saying it bodes well for Fox's portfolio since those packages most often consist of mainly sports and news content.

""We're very pleased with this trend of the bundle. It's financially, economically positive for us,"" said Murdoch on Tuesday. ""We would hope that this bundle will be attractive to the cordless customers — the cord-cutters and cord-nevers.""",2025-02-04 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/fox-subscription-streaming-service.html,cnbc
Comcast shifts strategy to mobile as fourth-quarter broadband numbers disappoint,"""In short, competitive conditions remain intense, dynamic and varied across our footprint and customer segments,"" Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said on Thursday's investor call. ""And we see no signs of this changing in the near term.""

The stagnation stems from a number of factors, primarily the rise of wireless providers such as Verizon and T-Mobile offering home broadband options.

Company executives said during Thursday's earnings call with investors that the company will shift its strategy to package mobile with broadband in a bid for more customers.

Broadband has long been the growth engine of the cable industry, especially after the exodus of cable TV customers. Although broadband segment revenue remains stable, Comcast, like its cable peers, has been in the midst of a slowdown in customer growth, which has concerned investors in recent years.

Comcast executives said Thursday the company will shift its focus to its mobile business after reporting a loss of 139,000 residential broadband customers during the fourth quarter.

Cable giant Comcast is looking to the wireless business for growth.

In 2022, Comcast and fellow cable giant Charter Communications each reported their first quarterly decline in broadband subscriber growth.

Executives have cited reasons such as the slowdown in buying and selling of homes — noting there are fewer people signing up for cable when they get a new home — as well as a drop-off in additions following robust growth at the height of the Covid pandemic, when lockdowns sent Americans home to work and learn.

But the rise of fixed wireless offerings from Verizon and T-Mobile has significantly ramped up competition. In December, Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson called out the dynamic and warned of a fourth-quarter loss of 100,000 customers. Thursday's announcement amounted to deeper-than-projected subscriber losses.

The so-called overbuilding of fiber internet has contributed to the competition, as has fixed wireless, a 5G high-speed broadband offering that is an alternative to cable broadband. Comcast in the past has dismissed fixed wireless as ""an inferior product.""

On Thursday CFO Jason Armstrong said the expectation is that fixed wireless, and likely satellite companies, will be ""carving out a permanent part of the market."" He also noted cable's increasing broadband speeds as an advantage.

In response, Comcast is looking to mobile to both grow and maintain its customer base.

""While we are the incumbent in the $80 billion U.S. residential broadband market, we are the challenger in the far larger $200 billion U.S. wireless market,"" said Armstrong. ""Wireless is an integral part of our broadband strategy.""

Comcast now counts more than 7.8 million mobile lines, or 12% penetration of its residential broadband customer base, giving it a ""long runway ahead.""

Comcast launched Xfinity Mobile in 2017, while Charter started offering mobile in 2018. The two biggest cable companies in the U.S. have touted consistent quarterly gains of mobile lines since then. Smaller operators such as Altice USA and Cox have also added the offering.

Comcast and its cable peers' mobile offerings rely on the wireless network of Verizon, as well as customers' home broadband networks and Wi-Fi hotspots. Only broadband customers of Comcast can sign up for mobile service through the company.

Cable companies have said their mobile businesses reduce so-called churn, or the loss of customers, and have been key to gaining new subscribers and driving revenue growth.

Cavanagh on Thursday said the company would push to simplify its bundles, following the lead of Charter's mobile and broadband offerings. In September, Charter unveiled a series of changes to its plans, including bundles with mobile, with CEO Chris Winfrey telling CNBC the company ""wanted to make a bold statement.""

"Comcast stock falls 11% after company underwhelms in broadband, Peacock subscribers","Comcast topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates Thursday despite reporting larger-than-expected broadband subscriber losses and stagnating paid subscribers for its streaming service, Peacock.

Wall Street has been particularly focused on cable companies' broadband businesses, which still garner high revenue and earnings but have been in the midst of a customer growth slump due to heightened competition from wireless companies, among other factors.

At the same time, streaming has been top of mind for the Street. Although profitability is now considered the key measure of success, investors have taken note of recent subscriber additions by major players since the introduction of cheaper, ad-supported tiers.

Comcast reported Thursday that it lost 139,000 residential broadband customers during the fourth quarter, more than the 100,000 losses that Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson had telegraphed in December during an investor conference.

Comcast President Mike Cavanagh on Thursday's investor call said the broadband losses were ""disappointing and worse than what we indicated in early December.""

The company also reported Thursday that Peacock had 36 million subscribers during the most recent quarter, up year over year but flat from the prior period. Wall Street had been looking for total paid subscribers of 37.56 million, according to estimates from StreetAccount.

Comcast shares fell 11% Thursday.

Here is how the company performed for the quarter, compared with average analyst estimates from LSEG:

Earnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 86 cents expected

96 cents adjusted vs. 86 cents expected Revenue: $31.92 billion vs. $31.64 billion expected

For the quarter ended Dec. 31, net income attributable to Comcast rose roughly 47% to $4.78 billion, or $1.24 per share, compared with $3.26 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.

Adjusting for one-time items, including interest expense and the value of certain assets, Comcast reported earnings per share of 96 cents for the period.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was up about 10% to $8.81 billion.

In addition to higher broadband revenue, Comcast's overall revenue was up 2% to $31.92 billion, thanks to an increase in segments including its mobile business, the film studio and revenue growth at streaming service Peacock. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Comcast reported revenue of $31.25 billion.

Despite the slowdown in cable industry broadband customer growth, the business is a key driver on balance sheets like Comcast's as average revenue per user has risen.

Broadband is part of Comcast's Connectivity and Platforms segment, which also includes Xfinity Mobile wireless, which was launched in 2017. The company surpassed 7.8 million mobile lines, and revenue from the unit helped propel overall residential connectivity revenue.

Comcast executives Thursday said the company would shift focus to the mobile business in a push to add more lines and further bundle it with broadband. Watson said Thursday the company will ""put the pedal down"" on the mobile effort in the second quarter.

Comcast lost 311,000 cable TV customers during the fourth quarter.

Meanwhile, revenue for the company's Content and Experiences business, which includes NBCUniversal's TV networks and streaming, the film studio and theme parks, was up 5% to roughly $12.08 billion during the fourth quarter.

Revenue for the media segment, which includes the TV networks, was up 3.5% to about $7.22 billion, namely due to higher revenue for Peacock due to an uptick in paid subscribers on the platform from the prior year. Overall domestic advertising for the media segment was flat as ad dollars for Peacock increased but the TV networks saw a smaller haul.

The media segment reported $298 million in adjusted EBITDA, falling short of Wall Street expectations of $317.1 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. The rest of the businesses in the content and experiences segment beat StreetAccount estimates, including overall adjusted EBITDA.

In November, Comcast announced it would spin off its cable network channels, a portfolio that includes CNBC, MSNBC, E!, Syfy, USA, Oxygen and the Golf Channel. The separation, which will also include digital assets such as Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes, is expected to take about a year. The NBC broadcast network, cable channel Bravo and Peacock will remain with Comcast.

Peacock has been moving toward profitability in recent quarters. On Thursday, Comcast reported Peacock had $1.3 billion in fourth-quarter revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $372 million, compared with $1 billion in revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $825 million in the same period last year.

Peacock's subscriber growth often rises on the back of major live sporting events on the platform. The Summer Olympics in Paris was a key driver in the third quarter, when the platform added 3 million subscribers. Exclusive NFL games have helped pad the streamer's numbers, and the company has touted the addition of the NBA and WNBA next season.

Universal Studios' revenue was up 6.7% to $3.27 billion, and the segment's adjusted EBITDA was up 85% to $569 million, boosted by the box office successes of films including ""Kung Fu Panda 4,"" ""Despicable Me 4,"" ""The Wild Robot"" and ""Wicked.""

Meanwhile, Theme Parks revenue was flat as lower attendance persisted at domestic locations.

CNN announces about 200 layoffs as it attempts to modernize business,"The stage is set for the first 2024 presidential debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump, in Atlanta on June 26, 2024.

Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN announced Thursday it is cutting about 6% of its total staff, or about 210 employees, as it refocuses the business around a global digital audience.

CNN CEO Mark Thompson announced the job losses in a memo to staff Thursday, confirming CNBC's reporting Wednesday that cuts were coming. In the memo, Thompson noted CNN doesn't expect total headcount to fall ""much"" this year because the company plans to invest $70 million in new digital plans.

""I know that whatever the total number of job losses, the impact on the individuals involved can be immense,"" Thompson wrote in the memo, obtained by CNBC. ""The process of change is essential if we're to thrive in the future, but I both acknowledge and regret its very real human consequences.""

The layoffs come as CNN is rearranging its linear TV lineup and building out digital subscription products. The cuts will help CNN lower production costs and consolidate teams, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic thinking. Certain shows that are produced in New York or Washington may move to Atlanta, where production can be done more cheaply, said the people.

For the most part, the job cuts won't affect CNN's most recognizable names, who are under contract, said the people. CNN has about 3,500 employees worldwide.

Netflix to hike prices on standard and ad-supported streaming plans,"The word ""Netflix"" shines brightly at the presentation of the new season (3) of the Netflix series ""Bridgerton"" in the Flora.

Netflix is hiking the price of most of its U.S. plans.

The streaming giant announced on Tuesday that its standard plan without commercials will increase from $15.49 a month to $17.99. Its cheaper, ad-supported plan, which was more recently introduced to attract more subscribers, will increase from $6.99 per month to $7.99.

In addition, the monthly cost of Netflix's premium plan will increase from $22.99 to $24.99.

The company, which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, said it will also raise prices in Canada, Portugal and Argentina.

Consumers have been faced with numerous price hikes in recent years across major streaming services including Netflix and its competitors, including Disney's apps and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max. Streamers have increasingly turned to higher prices and ad-supported plans as they look to reach profitability.

""When you're going to ask for a price increase, you better make sure you have the goods and engagement to back it up,"" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos during Tuesday's investor call, noting upcoming series and movies to be released in 2025.

During Tuesday's call, co-CEO Greg Peters said that the recent price increases in international markets went ""smoothly.""

Netflix last increased the cost of its standard plan without ads in 2022, while its premium plan last saw a hike in 2023. Meanwhile in 2023 the company discontinued its cheapest basic ad-free option. While the plan is no longer available to new customers, Netflix did increase the cost of it later that year.

Netflix had ditched the basic ad-free tier soon after it introduced its cheaper, ad-supported plan in November 2022 as a response to slowing subscriber growth at the time. In November, Netflix said it had reached 70 million global monthly active users on its ad plans. This is the first time Netflix has altered the price of the ad-supported plan.

The company has also been enforcing a crackdown on password sharing in a push to get more customers paying for its service.

As part of that change, Netflix has given subscribers the option to add ""extra members"" to their accounts. The streamer said Tuesday the cost of extra members on standard plans without commercials will rise from $7.99 per month to $8.99. The extra members on ad-supported plans won't see a price change.

"Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery call off plans to launch Venu sports streaming service","Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery have called off plans to launch their sports streaming service, Venu, the companies said in a joint statement Friday.

""After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,"" they said in the statement. ""In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels. We are proud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period.""

Venu was first announced in February and intended to combine the live sports assets of Fox, WBD and Disney-owned ESPN. It was initially slated to launch before the start of the NFL season in September, but was delayed in part by a legal challenge from internet TV bundler Fubo, which claimed the platform would be anticompetitive.

Together Disney, Fox and WBD control more than 50% of all U.S. sports media rights, and at least 60% of all nationally broadcast U.S. sports rights, according to the judge on the antitrust case.

The news that it would not launch came as a shock to Venu employees, who found out late Thursday night, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously to discuss internal matters. They believed they had a pathway forward to launch the service after Disney agreed earlier this week to merge its Hulu+ Live TV with Fubo , settling all litigation over Venu.

But the judge's response in Fubo's lawsuit questioned the legality of cable bundling in general, prompting Disney to strike the deal with Fubo, through which Disney would take 70% control of the resulting company. And two days ago, satellite providers DirecTV and Dish sent letters to federal court arguing that the legal questions brought up by the judge remained unanswered.

Rather than risk an extended lawsuit that could jeopardize bundling in general — including Disney's efforts to bundle its own streaming entities (ESPN, Hulu and Disney+) — the three companies decided to pull the plug on Venu, according to the people familiar.

Discovery – to compete on a level playing field to deliver sports fans more choice, control and value all in one experience"" DirecTV said in a statement.",2025-01-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/10/disney-fox-and-warner-bros-discovery-call-off-plans-to-launch-venu-sports-streaming-service.html,cnbc

Disney said Wednesday it has an estimated 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. That number includes 112 million users domestically and is an average per month over the last six months. While traditional TV outlets have a standard way of measuring ratings and viewership, there is still no industry standard methodology for measuring global streaming advertising audience size. The company said that its Disney Advertising unit has ""set out to define a globally consistent approach and methodology to estimate ad-supported audience numbers."" It's providing the update and further insight into its ad-supported streaming business during the annual CES tech conference in Las Vegas, a go-to event for the advertising and media industry. ""Disney sits at the intersection of world class sports and entertainment content, with the most high-value audiences in ad-supported global streaming at scale,"" said Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising, in a news release. ""We wanted to be the first to offer our industry greater transparency into the methodology used to estimate our engaged global ad-supported monthly active users.""

In explaining the methodology, the company said the metric is derived from active accounts across Disney's three streaming services that have viewed ad-supported shows and movies continuously for more than 10 seconds. ""Each active account is then multiplied by the number of estimated users per account ... to estimate the total number of users,"" it said. The estimated active users are added across the apps without de-duplication, meaning users who subscribe to more than one of the platforms could be counted more than once.

Disney to combine its Hulu+ Live TV with streamer Fubo,"Disney will combine its Hulu+ Live TV service with Fubo , merging together two internet TV bundles, the companies announced Monday.

Disney will become majority owner of the resulting company — the publicly traded Fubo company — with a 70% ownership stake. Fubo shareholders will own the remaining 30% of the company. The deal is expected to close in 12 to 18 months.

Both Hulu+ Live TV and Fubo are streaming services that mimic the traditional cable TV bundle, offering linear TV networks. Together the streaming services have 6.2 million subscribers.

Both services will still be available separately to consumers after the deal closes. Hulu+ Live TV can be streamed through the Hulu app, as well as part of Disney's bundle that also includes Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+.

The deal doesn't include the streamer Hulu, known for creating original content like ""Only Murders in the Building"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which competes with platforms like Netflix .

""We are now stewards of an iconic brand with respect to Hulu,"" said Fubo co-founder and CEO David Gandler during a Monday call with investors. He added that Hulu+ Live TV's place embedded inside the Hulu ecosystem adds value by way of user retention.

""Having two separate platforms today, obviously, it's not ideal,"" Gandler said during the call. ""We believe there are synergies on the backend. ... But at the moment we really want to provide consumers with choice.""

Gandler noted that while Fubo has long been focused on offering sports and news, Hulu+ Live TV is known for its entertainment offerings, too.

Fubo is expected to become immediately cash flow positive following the deal close, ""instantly making Fubo the major player in the streaming space,"" Gandler said on Monday's call.

Comcast to launch Universal Ads in bid to win smaller advertisers over from tech,"Comcast plans to launch a new advertising platform that will make it easier for smaller businesses to buy ad time — and, the company hopes, to beckon some advertisers away from social media and digital outlets and over to traditional TV's streaming businesses.

On Monday, Comcast announced the creation of Universal Ads, a new platform for advertisers to buy spots on premium video content on the streaming businesses of traditional media companies. The announcement comes ahead of the annual CES tech conference in Las Vegas.

Comcast has signed partnerships with other media companies, giving advertisers the ability to buy spots on a variety of outlets. So far, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal and ad-supported streamer Xumo are part of the platform, as well as A+E, AMC Networks , DirecTV, Fox Corp ., Paramount, Roku , TelevisaUnivision and Warner Bros. Discovery . Others are expected to join in the coming months.

""Universal Ads is intended to create new demand from advertisers who have not traditionally worked with us,"" said Mark Marshall, chairman of global advertising and partnerships for NBCUniversal, CNBC's parent company. ""And while we're starting with streaming and [small- and medium-sized businesses], in a future state this can be for linear and for agencies as well.""

Universal Ads, which will launch in the first quarter, is meant to create an easier experience for advertisers of all shapes and sizes to buy up ad time, which can be a notoriously complicated process in comparison to purchasing ads for platforms such as Meta, YouTube and TikTok, said James Rooke, president of Comcast Advertising. It's designed to mimic the process of buying ads on social media content and tech platforms.

""The head scratcher is that there's a sort of large number of advertisers who've built their businesses, or started to build their businesses, on the backs of social video,"" said Rooke. ""Yet when you talk to these advertisers there's an increasing wish to diversify away from a very limited number of big technology companies.""

Rooke said the challenge has been that these big tech companies ""make it super simple to transact on their platforms,"" whereas traditional media, or so-called premium content, does not.

Marshall said he and Rooke had been in discussions over the last several months on how to ""create new demand opportunities"" for the nontraditional advertisers.

Comcast built the free, self-service platform using its ad tech company FreeWheel. Many of the partners that have already signed on are FreeWheel clients.

There are also plans to offer free, automated artificial intelligence tools to help produce the ads, which can be another pain point for smaller companies.

""Universal Ads has a tremendous opportunity to steal market share from our competitors in a very unique and collaborative way that will fundamentally change the advertising landscape,"" said Marshall.",2025-01-06 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/comcast-universal-ads-platform.html,cnbc
"MSG Networks, home of Knicks and Rangers, goes dark for Altice USA's Optimum cable customers","Jalen Brunson, #11 of the New York Knicks, drives to the basket during the game against the Indiana Pacers in Round 2, Game 1 of the 2024 NBA Playoffs at Madison Square Garden in New York City on May 6, 2024.

Altice USA customers lost access to MSG Networks early Wednesday due to a carriage dispute between the cable TV operator and James Dolan's regional sports channels.

Customers of Altice USA's Optimum cable TV service lost access to the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York Rangers, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils early Wednesday. The blackout comes as the Knicks are on an eight-game win streak and are slated to play Wednesday evening.

Negotiations between Altice USA and MSG Networks broke down due to a dispute over fees — often the case in these discussions. The blackout shows the continuing struggles for regional sports networks as customers leave the cable TV bundle at a fast clip, and operators push back on high fees.

Both Altice USA and MSG Networks each issued statements early Wednesday regarding the dispute.

""We offered Altice a number of fair and reasonable proposals that called for Altice to pay us less than last year,"" according to a MSG Networks statement. ""Altice rejected all of them, including our offer to keep MSG Networks on the air while we continued to try to reach a deal. We remain ready to negotiate in good faith.""

However, Altice USA said in a statement that ""MSG Networks is demanding exorbitant programming fees – which could raise our customers' cable bills – and, to add insult to injury, MSG Networks is requiring us to make their channels available to the vast majority of Optimum video subscribers, which would force customers to pay for content they do not to watch.""

Altice USA noted MSG Networks' streaming options for customers that still want access to their teams.

New York-based Altice USA had more than 1.9 million residential cable TV customers as of Sept. 30, after losing about 77,000 compared to the same quarter in the previous year.

The regional sports networks business has been severely affected by the consumer switch from traditional cable TV bundles to streaming options. In 2024 Diamond Sports, the owner of the biggest portfolio of these networks, won court approval to exit bankruptcy protection after it was plagued by the same headwinds.

Like other regional sports networks, MSG Networks launched a streaming option in 2023 priced at $29.99 a month. In 2024 MSG Networks teamed up with the YES Network, which features local games for the New York Yankees, for a combined offering called the Gotham Sports app, which costs $359.99 annually or $41.99 a month.

The high prices of these streaming options show the regional sports networks must be careful not to further disrupt the cable TV model and breach contracts with distributors. These contracts with cable TV operators help support the billions of dollars in fees the networks pay professional sports teams to air their games.",2025-01-01 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/01/msg-networks-knicks-rangers-goes-dark-altice-usa-optimum-cable.html,cnbc
Ad revenue should stabilize for media companies in 2025 — if they have sports,"The New York Liberty celebrate after wining the 2024 WNBA Championship against the Minnesota Lynx during Game 5 of the 2024 WNBA Finals on October 20, 2024 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

The advertising market has positive momentum going into 2025 — especially for media companies with sports rights and tentpole live programming.

Sports and live events such as awards shows reigned supreme in conversations with media executives who weighed in on their expectations for the advertising market in the year ahead. The end of the uncertainty surrounding the election has helped the outlook improve, too, they said.

And despite consumers fleeing the traditional TV bundles, with more ad dollars going toward streaming, executives emphasized that traditional TV is still important in discussions with advertisers, especially when it comes to sports.

Overall, executives said they expect stability in the market and are hoping to move past the slowdown in ad spending in recent years.

""Normalization is the right way to say it with the advertising market,"" said Mark Marshall, NBCUniversal's chairman of global advertising and partnerships. ""With the election settled, a lot of companies feel the uncertainty over that has gone away.""

He added that the company has seen more so-called scatter market budgets come in during the fourth quarter, which is what the industry calls the buying and selling of ads closer to their airdate versus ads that are bought further out.

""Our first quarter is looking really strong. I think that any election year is challenging for anyone in the fourth quarter because a lot of marketers end up sitting on their hands since the airwaves and digital are crowded,"" said Dan Porter, CEO of sports media company Overtime. ""I think that's true for us and it's true for everyone.""

Yet despite the uptick in ad revenue following the election and the forecast stability, Natalie Bastian, global chief marketing officer at Teads, said she expects a lot of the same trends.

Bastian noted that 2024 included major moments like the Summer Olympics and presidential election, which strengthened TV ad revenue. She expects the same budgets to carry over into the new year, however.

""What we've heard in general from some of our closest partners … media budgets aren't growing, and so there's just more selection into where [advertisers are] spending their money,"" said Bastian. This makes sports and live programming that much more important to media companies.

Overall, the global advertising industry is expected to surpass $1 trillion in total revenue for the first time this year, excluding U.S. political advertising, and will grow 7.7% in 2025 to reach $1.1 trillion, according to a recent report from GroupM, WPP's media investment group. Advertising on digital platforms — which includes retail media as a segment — is what's driving that increase.

TV, considered ""the most effective form of advertising,"" is expected to grow nearly 2% in 2025 to $169.1 billion in total global ad revenue. In comparison, ad revenue for ""pure-play digital,"" which excludes ""the digital extensions of traditional media"" like streaming but includes platforms like YouTube and TikTok, is expected to grow by 10% to $813.3 billion globally in 2025, according to GroupM.",2024-12-27 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/27/advertising-revenue-media-companies-in-2025.html,cnbc
"Richard Parsons, former Time Warner CEO, dies at age 76","Richard 'Dick' Parsons Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Richard Parsons, who helped Time Warner divorce from AOL after what was considered one of the worst takeovers in history, has died. He was 76. His death was confirmed by Lazard, where he was a longtime board member. Parsons became CEO of AOL Time Warner in 2002, replacing Gerald Levin, who stepped aside two years after the media giant's disastrous $165 billion merger with the upstart internet company. As CEO and later chairman, he led Time Warner's turnaround, dropping ""AOL"" from the corporation's name and shrinking the company's $30 billion in debt to $16.8 billion by selling Warner Music and other properties. ""The merger did not work out quite the way many of us expected. The internet bubble burst and we had to fix the leaks,"" Parsons told The Independent in 2004. ""It was not as monumental a task as many people thought, as the fundamental businesses of the old Time Warner — like publishing, the cable networks and movies — was running well."" He said that after the merger, AOL's business had collapsed and Warner Music Group was declining, along with the entire music industry. ""So we sold our music business, as well as other nonstrategic assets, to strengthen our balance sheet and put in new management."" Parsons stepped down from Time Warner in 2007.

The Rockefeller connection

Richard Dean ""Dick"" Parsons was born into a working-class family on April 4, 1948, in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section and grew up in South Ozone Park in Queens, New York. He was a middle child among five siblings. He attended public school, skipping two grades, and at age 16, the 6-foot-4 Parsons enrolled at the University of Hawaii, where he played basketball and met his future wife, Laura Ann Bush, whom he married in 1968. After graduation, he returned to New York state to attend Albany Law School, moonlighting as a part-time janitor to help pay his tuition and finishing at the top of his class. During an internship at the New York state legislature, he developed ties to moderate Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, who became vice president under Gerald Ford in 1974 in the wake of President Richard Nixon's resignation. Parsons became associate director of President Ford's domestic policy council. ""The old-boy network lives,"" Parsons told The New York Times in a 1994 interview. ""I didn't grow up with any of the old boys. I didn't go to school with any of the old boys. But by becoming a part of that Rockefeller entourage, that created for me a group of people who've looked out for me ever since."" After Ford's defeat by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Parsons returned to New York and joined the law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in 1977, as did his friend Rudy Giuliani. Parsons and his wife and three children moved to Rockefeller country, Briarcliff Manor in Westchester County. Coincidentally, his maternal grandfather had been a groundskeeper on John D. Rockefeller's nearby estate, Kykuit.

13 anonymous media executives make predictions for the new year,"Ho, ho, ho! It's a holiday tradition: Anonymous media executives make their 2025 industry predictions.

In honor of the 12 days of Christmas, we give you 12 predictions from some of the most powerful media and entertainment executives in the world, weighing in on the condition of anonymity so they can speak candidly about their visions of the year ahead. And then, because we have holiday cheer, we give you a bonus one. A baker's dozen!

Looking back at 2024's predictions, they were not as good as previous years. But there were some hits, or partial hits.

While Warner Bros. Discovery's Max, Netflix and Disney didn't all team up for the first significant streaming bundle, as one participant predicted last year, Max and Disney did join forces. TV broadcast station groups continued to pick off regional sports rights, as another executive anticipated. RedBird Capital didn't quite acquire Paramount Global , but the private equity firm was part of the consortium with Skydance that announced a merger with the company in July.

As for other 2024 predictions, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo did not win their activist campaign to join the Disney board; Disney CEO Bob Iger did not renew his contract beyond 2026, buy Candle Media or name Dana Walden his successor; and NBA media rights did not go to Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Apple — they went to Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon .

Oh, and one more miss: While Comcast did announce a spinoff of most of its cable networks, it did not spin off NBCUniversal and merge it with Warner Bros. Discovery.

That's a nice segue to this year's predictions:

Executive 1: Comcast will acquire the studio and streaming assets of Warner Bros. Discovery and merge them with NBCUniversal

Second time's the charm! Warner Bros. Discovery is separating its linear assets from the rest of the company. Comcast is spinning out most of its cable networks. It has to mean something, right?

Executive 2: Comcast will acquire Charter and spin off the rest of NBCUniversal

That's right, Comcast may have SpinCo 1 and SpinCo 2! This executive predicts Comcast will test the Donald Trump regulatory administration and try to combine the two largest U.S. cable companies, 10 years after dropping its bid to buy Time Warner Cable — which used to be the second-largest U.S. cable provider before it was acquired by Charter — after concluding the government would block the deal.

Executive 3: Fox will acquire most of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets

After selling the majority of its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, Fox will shock the media world by again gaining scale, acquiring HBO, the movie studio, the Turner networks and the streaming assets of Warner Bros. Discovery, according to this executive.

For what it's worth, another executive predicted Fox would sell, given the unknown future of the Murdoch family trust.

Executive 4: Dana Walden will leave Disney at year-end when she doesn't get the CEO job

Disney has already said it plans to delay naming a new CEO until early 2026, so this prediction assumes the company will slightly move up the announcement. Walden, Disney's co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, is the ultimate Hollywood insider who many view as the front-runner for the job. The board is taking its time vetting candidates after the handoff from Iger to Bob Chapek in 2020 did not go very well.

Comcast shares tumble as executive calls broadband 'intensely competitive',"View from behind a Comcast truck parked on a residential street in Lafayette, California, on Sept. 28, 2021.

Comcast Cable CEO Dave Watson told investors on Monday that the company expects to lose more than 100,000 broadband subscribers during the fourth quarter as the market remains ""competitively intense.""

Comcast shares dropped nearly 10% following Watson's remarks at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference on Monday.

Cable broadband growth has been in the middle of an ongoing slump. While executives have also pinned the drop on the slowdown in the buying and selling of homes — noting that there are fewer people signing up for cable when they get a new house — the ramped-up competition from wireless providers such as Verizon and T-Mobile has played a big role, too.

""Our competition remains competitively intense. That has not changed; it has been pretty consistent throughout the year,"" particularly among ""price conscious"" consumers, Watson said Monday.

Watson noted that the fourth quarter is likely to reflect the first half of the year, when the company lost ""just under 100,000"" customers per quarter.

Despite the continued cable trends, Watson added that Comcast's broadband business has remained stable when it comes to its higher-end internet packages.

His warning comes after Comcast saw a relatively improved third quarter when it comes to losses.

The company said in October that domestic broadband net losses totaled 87,000 during the third quarter. However, excluding the losses that stemmed from the end of the government's Affordable Connectivity Program, which had offered a discount for qualifying low-income households, the company estimated there was a growth of 9,000 customers.

Comcast had nearly 32 million domestic broadband customers as of Sept. 30.

Watson on Monday attributed the third-quarter improvement to seasonality. The return to school often means improved broadband numbers. He also noted that NBCUniversal's marketing of the Summer Olympics helped, too.

ESPN hopes to reach more casual sports fans with Disney+ integration,"ESPN is coming to Disney+. Now, the sports network wants to make sure Disney+ users come to ESPN.

Walt Disney debuted a dedicated ESPN tile Wednesday on Disney+ for people who subscribe to ESPN+, its sports streaming platform, to watch programming without leaving the Disney+ application. Next fall, when ESPN launches its yet-to-be-named ""flagship"" service, those subscribers will get full access to all ESPN content through the ESPN tile on Disney+.

Disney is making about 100 live games available to Disney+ members without a corresponding ESPN subscription. Those events will span college football and basketball, the National Basketball Association and WNBA, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, tennis, golf, the Little League World Series, and UFC, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in an interview.

Next week's alternate ""Simpsons"" telecast of the NFL's ""Monday Night Football"" game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also be available to Disney+ subscribers, as well as five NBA Christmas games.

""Now when you subscribe to Disney+, you'll have access to kids and family, general entertainment if you're a Hulu subscriber, and sports,"" said Pitaro. ""Our goal is to serve sports fans anytime, anywhere.""

ESPN will also include some of its studio programming — such as ""College Gameday,"" ""Pardon the Interruption"" and certain podcasts that include video — on Disney+ for non-ESPN subscribers. Some ESPN sports-related films and documentaries will also appear on Disney+ married to whatever sports season is active, Pitaro said.

Comcast's cable network spinoff may be a signal to the media industry for necessary change,"Comcast shares posted modest gains Wednesday after the company announced its plan to spin off all of NBCUniversal's cable networks, except Bravo, into a separate publicly traded entity.

Investors' initial shrug at the proposed transaction underscores the uncertainty of the maneuver.

The hope for Comcast is that by shedding declining assets, the company's shares will rise. Cable networks are still profitable, but they're hemorrhaging subscribers and revenue every year as Americans cancel traditional pay TV for streaming services. That may be an anchor on Comcast's shares. Wall Street typically doesn't like assets with slumping revenue and profit.

Still, there's plenty of uncertainty around the spinoff. It's unclear if Comcast investors will care that much. The NBCUniversal cable networks are relatively small assets, generating about $7 billion in revenue over the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to a Comcast news release. For comparison, the rest of Comcast took in about $116 billion in revenue.

It's also unclear if the spun-off company will flourish as a publicly traded entity. If Comcast is shedding cable networks because Wall Street doesn't like them, why would shareholders want a company that consists of declining assets?

There's a reason Disney decided not to spin its cable assets. The company considered it and ultimately decided the earnings lost from spinning profitable networks would trump any potential multiple expansion from a spin. Still, Disney's cable networks, including FX and Disney Channel, are more integrated with its streaming platforms than NBCUniversal's cable networks are with Peacock, the company's subscription streaming service.

The new company, temporarily called ""SpinCo,"" will generate cash and could pay a healthy dividend to shareholders looking to invest in declining cash assets. But that's usually more of a private equity strategy. That may ultimately be where cable networks are heading — to private ownership willing to harvest them for cash.

It's also possible some of the cable networks could find new footing outside of NBCUniversal's ownership. SpinCo's CEO-to-be, Mark Lazarus, may be able to strike new licensing agreements with other streaming services now that the cable assets aren't purely a marketing and content distribution tool for Peacock.

Profits for SpinCo can be reinvested into businesses, including CNBC and MSNBC, instead of being diverted toward Peacock and NBCUniversal's theme parks.

Another possible path for the spinoff is as a rollup entity for other cable networks. Comcast is purposefully structuring SpinCo with low debt. Perhaps the company could take on some of Warner Bros. Discovery's debt and its cable networks. The same could be said for Paramount Global.",2024-11-20 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/comcast-cable-networks-spinoff-emphasizes-need-for-change-in-media.html,cnbc

The announcement comes weeks after Comcast executives said during the company's quarterly earnings call that it was considering a split of the cable networks. Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said at the time the company was exploring creating ""a new, well-capitalized company owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks."" The networks being spun off also include Syfy, Golf Channel, USA and Oxygen, according to a company memo from Cavanagh. Bravo will remain part of Comcast's NBCUniversal and will continue to fuel the company's streaming service, Peacock. The separation will also include digital assets such as Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine, the memo said. Cavanagh said in October that NBCUniversal's broadcast network NBC and Peacock would remain with Comcast. The combined properties of the new entity generated approximately $7 billion in revenue in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Comcast said in a news release. The new entity will be led by Mark Lazarus, the current chairman of NBCUniversal's media group. NBCUniversal's chief financial officer, Anand Kini, will serve as the CFO and operating chief. The separation is expected to take about a year. ""As a standalone company with these outstanding assets, we will be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns in this incredibly dynamic media environment across news, sports and entertainment,"" Lazarus said in the release. ""We see a real opportunity to invest and build additional scale and I'm excited about the growth opportunities this transition will unlock. Our financial strength will also provide capacity for an attractive capital return policy while allowing for investment in the growth of these businesses."" Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts will maintain economic and voting interests in the company, being referred to for now as ""SpinCo,"" but will not serve as an officer or on the board of directors.

Cutting the cord

Cord cutting continues to impact the traditional TV business. Comcast lost 365,000 TV customers during the third quarter, it said last month. The industry overall lost roughly 4 million traditional pay TV customers in the first six months of the year, according to analyst firm MoffettNathanson. Still, traditional TV networks remain cash cows for media businesses. Comcast reported in October that third-quarter revenue for its media segment, which is mainly comprised of the TV networks, was up nearly 37% to $8.23 billion, largely due to the Olympics. Without the Summer Games, revenue was up almost 5%. Disney executives recently said they don't plan to separate their TV networks anytime soon, noting the complexities of doing so, and saying the costs would outweigh the benefits. And Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav called the business ""extraordinarily important"" to the company, despite a $9.1 billion write down of its TV networks. By separating Comcast's cable networks from NBCUniversal, it will give them the optionality to merge with other networks, or potentially be sold to private equity, CNBC previously reported. It will also leave room for further investment in the networks, particularly the entertainment division, one of the people said. The company had been recently integrating its news businesses — CNBC, MSNBC and NBC News. That will now be undone, according to a person familiar. Comcast executives will take the next year to determine whether licensing agreements need to be put in place between NBC and the new entity, and whether MSNBC and CNBC will continue to work with NBC News in any capacity, according to two people familiar with the matter. Formal discussions have yet to take place between CNBC, MSNBC and NBC News, one of the people said. NBCUniversal's wide breadth of sports featured on USA and The Golf Channel, which includes the English Premier League, NASCAR, WWE, the Olympics, college basketball, PGA Tour and other content, will still be featured on the cable networks, the release said. While NBC's broadcast network and Peacock will still carry sports content, it's expected for it to be shared with the spun-off networks in the future, the person said.

Padding Peacock

Cable network Bravo, known for its ""Housewives"" franchises and other reality TV, will remain with NBCUniversal because its content is a big part of Peacock, the people said. Separating the other networks will be simpler as much less of the content is integral to Peacock, one of the people said, noting that only 2% of the viewing on the streamer is of content from the networks that will be separated. In addition to Bravo, Peacock's platform is heavily padded by Universal's films, and entertainment and sports from the NBC broadcast network. Peacock has gotten a big boost from NBC's sports programming, particularly the National Football League and the Olympics. During the most recent quarter Peacock added 3 million subscribers, largely due to the Olympics, where it was exclusively streamed, bringing its total to 36 million paid customers. NBCUniversal's streaming platform continues to rack up losses, but they have narrowed compared to prior quarters. Media companies have focused on making their streaming businesses profitable, with Disney reporting streaming growth and profitability again this past quarter. Once the cable networks are separated from Comcast, Lazarus will have the power to move forward with a variety of options when it comes to licensing content to other platforms, the person added. The networks' content could find a home on other streaming platforms, and networks would be free to create their own streaming services, the person said.

1 in 5 Americans get their news from social media influencers,"Getty Images

About 1 in 5 Americans say they regularly get their news from ""news influencers"" on social media, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. The rise of social media personalities doling out information was particularly true among the youngest users, and comes at a time of heightened polarization surrounding the U.S. presidential election. ""We thought about news influencers as sources of authority to their audiences about what's happening in the world,"" Galen Stocking, a senior computational social scientist at the Pew Research Center, told CNBC. ""And one thing we found when doing that, 65% said that they found the information they got from news influencers helps them better understand the world."" Close to 40% of adults under 30 who were included in the study said they stay informed from independent social media figures, the largest chunk of any age group. Democratic strategist and Columbia professor Basil Smikle said that shift has been playing out since at least 2016. ""Part of it is convenience,"" Smikle said. ""You have access to all the information you need from your phone. So because social media is pushing information to you, the ease with which you have information at your fingertips is difficult to ignore."" But Smikle said that convenience can turn into a habit that's hard to break and may lead to a greater spread of misinformation. ""When you're getting information through social media, how do you know how original that information is?"" he said. ""It's very hard to verify that and unfortunately, the algorithm doesn't care. It just keeps sending you the same kind of information."" Around two-thirds of the roughly 500 accounts that Pew defined as ""news influencers"" for the study were active on multiple platforms between July and August. Social media site X remained the most popular, with 85% of influencer respondents reporting they were on the site. Meta -owned Instagram took second place, while YouTube, the most popular platform for Gen Z, or people born between 1997 and 2012, came in third. TikTok sat below Meta's Threads and Facebook as sixth-most popular among influencers.

Risk of misinformation

Questions around the influence of independent social media creators on politics erupted prior to and after the presidential election. Both candidates utilized social media to reach younger voters, most notably when President-elect Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast and Vice President Kamala Harris joined the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast — both podcasts with large followings on social media.

""The ease with which you can get in front of a voter with information has increased exponentially, and I can consistently send you that information so much so that there comes a point where you're not going to go look for it,"" Smikle said. Smikle said social media is also a much less expensive option for candidates trying to reach a larger audience, especially when you add in news influencers who can post about the candidates and their platforms. Candidates may also have an easier time advancing their message via podcasts rather than a traditional interview on a network, according to Syracuse professor Joshua Darr. Network interviews in recent elections have tended to be more combative than those conducted on independent podcasts or social media accounts, Darr said. ""It's probably good for the electorate to have a hard sit-down interview, but if it's a series of rapid fire gotcha questions, I don't know if that's something campaigns are going to sign up for,"" he said. One result, according to Smikle, is that misinformation can spread more easily. ""There were standards that the networks used to determine what was true,"" he said. ""Those guardrails are gone through social media."" Alaina Wood, one of the news influencers listed in the Pew report, said misinformation often becomes too widespread to combat until after it's already had real impact. Wood's content is primarily based on climate news, particularly with her series that highlights positive climate stories. After her east Tennessee community was hit by Hurricane Helene in September, she said misinformation began to spread about people accused of stealing in the wake of the storm. ""Everyone kind of agrees that trying to get a handle on misinformation before it becomes a thing can really help,"" she said. The problem, according to Wood, is that videos correcting misinformation often don't go as viral as the original clip.

More male, conservative

Previous Pew research found more women consume news on sites including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok than men, but the new survey suggests close to two-thirds of news influencers are men. That difference is seen most with YouTube and Facebook, where 68% and 67% of news influencers are men, respectively. On TikTok, around 50% of respondents were men, compared with 48% women and 2% who identify either as nonbinary or whose gender could not be determined.

Matteo, who goes by ""The Justice Guy"" across his social media accounts, is another influencer listed in the report who often clashes online with other creators around misinformation and national politics. He said he's noticed major differences in the gender breakdown of his audiences across different platforms as well as their political ideologies. ""On YouTube I get roasted,"" he told CNBC. ""That's not going to stop me from posting what I post. But I would say the vast majority of the people that responds to my videos are very conservative. And I would say that probably YouTube is as close to MAGA as as you can get."" Among the 52% of influencers who responded to Pew researchers with an explicit political orientation, more identified with right-leaning politics, according to the report. That difference is amplified on certain platforms, including Facebook, where three times as many respondents identified as conservative than those who identified as liberal. Matteo said his audience on TikTok, where he started his social media following and which remains his primary platform today, is much more liberal and primarily women. ""Most people will interact with the content that they enjoy, and that feeds the algorithm and creates echo chambers,"" he said. ""If you're not aware of it, you end up thinking 100% of the people around you feel a certain way, just because you feel this affinity with the information you're consuming.""

Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to end its quest to own a package of live National Basketball Association games in the U.S. for the 2025-26 season and beyond, settling all of its legal disputes with the league.

Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA in July, claiming the league failed to allow the media company to use its so-called matching rights on a package of live games.

The league selected three media partners — Disney , Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video — to be its U.S. distributors of live games for 11 years beginning next season. The total value of the deal, including WNBA games, was about $77 billion, CNBC previously reported.

The settlement with Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Monday, as well as a separate agreement between WBD and ESPN, will keep the company in the mix with some NBA content, production partnerships and licensing deals. However, it officially ends Turner Sports' 40-year relationship with the NBA as a carrier of live games in the U.S. after this season.

Turner Sports has had an NBA package since 1984, with games airing on cable network TNT since 1988. The NBA decided to move away from Warner Bros. Discovery as a media partner for several reasons, including losing faith in the long-term future of cable TV as a method for reaching a younger audience.

Disney and Comcast have broadcast networks to showcase NBA games, and Amazon's package is exclusively streaming.

The terms of the settlement grant WBD's TNT Sports free access to highlights for the company's Bleacher Report digital news site and its social media platform House of Highlights for the next 11 years, according to a person familiar with the details. The deal also allows Warner Bros. Discovery to license, create, and distribute new and existing NBA content across its media assets and includes live game rights in the Nordic countries, Poland and Latin America, excluding Brazil and Mexico.

The agreement also extends a partnership between NBA Digital and TNT Sports for five seasons that allows the NBA to engage Warner Bros. Discovery to provide promotion and ""a variety of services, including production, content development and sales operations services,"" according to a statement.

The settlement gives Warner Bros. Discovery years of guaranteed revenue from the NBA. The league isn't paying WBD any additional money for those services beyond the terms of the settlement, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to speak anonymously because some details of the agreement are private.",2024-11-18 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/18/nba-warner-bros-discovery-settle-lawsuit-over-live-game-rights.html,cnbc
Disney earnings offer hope that streaming can successfully supplant linear TV,"In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Disney might be proving the world's most famous investor wrong. Last year, Warren Buffett, ""The Oracle of Omaha,"" told CNBC's Becky Quick he had no faith in the business of streaming video. ""Streaming ... it's not really a very good business,"" Buffett said on April 12, 2023. ""The shareholders really haven't done that great over time."" Buffett wasn't lying. Legacy media companies such as Comcast's NBCUniversal, Disney, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery have all underperformed the S&P 500 since Jan. 1, 2022, largely due to billions of dollars lost while launching subscription streaming services.

But Disney's quarterly earnings results, released Thursday, indicate streaming is about to become a much better business. A combination of pulling back on content spending and steadily increasing Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers hasn't just turned streaming into a profitable business, it's actually turned streaming into an even better business than traditional TV, according to Disney Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston. For Disney's fiscal 2025, streaming will generate enough operating income to offset the parallel decline in operating income from linear TV, Johnston said in an interview. Disney projects entertainment direct-to-consumer operating income will increase by about $875 million next year over fiscal year 2024. That would put the division at over $1 billion in operating income for the coming fiscal year. ""I think we're well-positioned if [consumers] decide to stay in linear for longer, and I think we're well-positioned if they decide to move over to the streaming side,"" Johnston said during Disney's earnings conference call. Those results are borne out in Disney's earnings. Disney's combined streaming businesses improved their profitability in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, posting operating income of $321 million. For the year, Disney's entertainment streaming platforms, Disney+ and Hulu, made $143 million in operating income. Last year, the entertainment platforms lost $2.5 billion.

Disney doesn't plan to change its TV networks portfolio anytime soon,"Disney has done the math on separating its TV networks business, and it appears too messy to be done — at least for now.

The company's chief financial officer, Hugh Johnston, said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the ""cost is probably more than the benefit"" when it comes to separating its TV networks business, given the ""operational complexity.""

The future of the traditional TV network business has been top of mind in the media industry. In late October, Comcast executives said they were exploring a separation of the cable networks business. Executives said the process was in early stages and the outcome was unclear.

The cable news bundle, despite still being a cash cow for companies, is losing customers at a fast clip. The industry overall lost 4 million traditional pay TV subscribers in the first six months of the year, according to estimates from analyst firm MoffettNathanson.

Disney reported Thursday that revenue for its traditional TV networks was down 6% for its most recent quarter to $2.46 billion, while profit in the division sank 38% to $498 million.

Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. The streaming business' growth and profitability — combined with a blockbuster summer at the box office and further investments in the company's theme parks business — comes during a time of turmoil across the media industry. Disney has been restructuring the Mouse House under the stewardship of returnee CEO Bob Iger, who's getting the company into shape before handing it off to a successor in early 2026. Company executives on Thursday touted Disney's significant progress during the last year and said they're ""confident in the long-term prospects for the business,"" issuing guidance that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027. During Disney's fiscal 2025, the company expects high-single-digit adjusted earnings growth compared with the prior fiscal year. The company expects double-digit adjusted EPS growth in both fiscal 2026 and 2027. ""I think the fact that we have had such a strong '24 overall has been an important part of the guidance we are getting,"" said Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston in an interview Thursday with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""If you think of the big initiatives we have invested, putting creativity back at the center of the company, and on top of that, we said we wanted to improve profitability and we are clearly doing that in a substantive way.""

Streaming strides

Five years since Disney+ launched, the streaming service has stemmed annual losses of $4 billion as recently as fiscal 2022, and is now profitable. Disney's combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, reported operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. Company executives said in the release they are confident streaming ""will be a significant growth area"" for Disney. Disney also joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. Company executives said more than half of new U.S. Disney+ subscribers are choosing the cheaper, ad-supported tier, adding this ""bodes well for the future."" Media companies have been focused on advertising as a measure to drive profitability in the streaming business. During the fiscal fourth quarter Disney's streaming entertainment ad revenue was up 14% due to Disney+, and executives expect it to be a driver of streaming revenue going forward. However, they expect a ""modest decline"" in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter, due to higher pricing and the end of a recent promotional offer. Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared with the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double-digit percentage in its fiscal 2026. Meanwhile the company's traditional TV networks business continued to decline in the most recent quarter as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. Revenue for Disney's sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN's profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle.

Disney and James Gorman hope to foolproof the process to find Bob Iger's successor,"Disney is counting on incoming board chairman James Gorman to deliver an ironclad system to identify the best possible successor for CEO Bob Iger.

Given Gorman's track record, some board members are hoping he'll lead the company to name a successor sooner than the early-2026 deadline that it's announced, people familiar with the matter tell CNBC.

Disney announced last month that Gorman will take over as board chairman from Mark Parker, who is also Nike's executive chairman, effective in January. With that announcement, Disney gave Gorman a full year in the role before the deadline to name Iger's replacement. The timeline also gives the yet-to-be-named successor time to be mentored by Iger before his tenure ends.

Parker decided to step down as board chairman to focus on challenges at Nike and to clear the way for Gorman, who is already chair of the Disney board succession planning committee, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

Gorman, Morgan Stanley's former CEO, is known for having run a smooth succession process to replace himself at the bank. He's credited with creating financial incentives to ensure that the two executives who were in the running for the top job — but ultimately failed to land it — would stay on at the company.

Disney's board is hoping that Gorman will do the same at the media giant to ensure that it doesn't lose any of its top talent, the people familiar said.

Disney's board has been meeting regularly with its four internal candidates: Entertainment Co-Chairmen Dana Walden and Alan Bergman along with Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro.

Gorman is also working with a recruiting firm to identify and bring in potential outside candidates, including those in fields outside media and entertainment, the people familiar said. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Disney is considering, among other external names, EA CEO Andrew Wilson.

Wilson's name has been floated, according to people familiar with the matter, but they say the board is more likely to chose one of the internal candidates than Wilson.

And while there's been speculation that Disney could consider naming co-CEOs given the diversity of its businesses, the board is prioritizing identifying a single chief executive, the people said.

Disney declined to comment beyond the October press release announcing Gorman as board chair. The company reports earnings for its most recent quarter Thursday morning.",2024-11-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/disney-james-gorman-bob-iger-successor.html,cnbc
Amazon Prime Video to stream Diamond regional sports networks,"Diamond Sports reached a deal with Amazon's Prime Video that will allow its 16 regional sports networks to be made available on the streaming platform.

As part of the deal, Diamond's networks will be made available as an add-on subscription to Prime customers living within each team's designated geographic area. Further details, such as pricing, will be announced at a later date. Financial terms of the multiyear agreement were not disclosed.

The agreement is not exclusive, meaning Diamond can still pursue streaming rights deals with other partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company's previously launched FanDuel Sports Network streaming options will still be available.

This marks the latest development for Diamond Sports as it looks to exit bankruptcy protection with a revamped business model.

In October, Diamond inked a naming rights deal with Flutter -owned FanDuel, rebranding its networks from Bally Sports to FanDuel Sports Network. The name change took place immediately during the National Hockey League season and ahead of the start of the 2024-25 National Basketball Association season.

Earlier this week, Diamond also announced it would offer games on an a la carte basis at $6.99 per game beginning Dec. 5, which will not require a subscription. Both Prime Video and the FanDuel Sports Network app will offer the single games, according to the person familiar with the offering.

On Thursday, Diamond will seek court approval for its reorganization plan, which has drawn criticism from Major League Baseball and the Atlanta Braves, who question the company's future viability under the plan.

Both the league and the Braves had requested further clarity on what the partnership with Amazon, which at the time was not solidified, would entail.

Diamond sought bankruptcy protection last year, toppled by a heavy debt load and the effect of cord-cutting on its networks as consumers opt out of cable TV bundles for streaming services.

Diamond has also inked deals with the NBA and NHL for TV and streaming rights for their teams. It has been negotiating with MLB teams on an individual basis.

Various regional sports networks, including the New York Yankees' YES Network, have launched streaming options in recent years. Amazon's Prime Video already airs a selection of Yankees games each season since it is a stakeholder in the YES Network.

Pricing has been on the higher end of the scale, as the networks have been careful when it comes to pricing their streaming options so as not to further disrupt the cable TV model and breach contracts with distributors. These contracts have long helped support the billions of dollars in fees that the networks pay professional sports teams to air games.",2024-11-13 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amazon-prime-video-to-stream-diamond-regional-sports-networks.html,cnbc
Liberty Media to spin off assets; CEO Greg Maffei to step down at year-end,"Liberty Media announced Wednesday that it's spinning off most assets besides Formula One auto racing into a separate publicly traded company, called Liberty Live, and that CEO Greg Maffei is stepping down at year-end.

Chairman John Malone will become interim CEO of Liberty Media. Liberty Media's investor day is set to take place on Thursday in Manhattan.

While the 83-year-old Malone will once again take the reigns as CEO, the moves simplify his empire and continue a wind down for Liberty, said Chris Marangi, Co-CIO of Value at Gabelli Funds.

""Malone has accelerated the surfacing and simplification of value,"" said Marangi in an interview. ""Liberty has come a long way in the 20-plus years that it's been a standalone entity. It's created enormous shareholder value. We're in the final act.""

After the split, Liberty Media will hold Formula One, which Liberty acquired in 2016 and later spun out as a tracking stock, and MotoGP, upon the closing of that transaction. Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

The company also announced cable giant Charter Communications would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone's portfolio. Liberty Broadband owns 26% of Charter shares.

The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is projected to be completed in mid-2027.

""The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media's capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,"" Maffei said in a release.

""Following today's announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,"" Maffei said in a separate release. ""While it's never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.""

Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company's assets, including Charter.

Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the ""cable cowboy,"" and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He's been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

He's chairman of the board of Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty Global. While Malone has remained an active investor and talking head in the industry, it's notable that he is taking over as interim CEO of Liberty Media.

DirecTV says Dish purchase is off,"A Dish Network satellite dish (L) is mounted next to a DirecTV dish on the roof of an apartment building on April 15, 2013 in San Rafael, California.

DirecTV is abandoning its acquisition of Dish assets after a group of bondholders refused to accept the terms of a proposed debt offer, a DirecTV spokesperson said.

""A successful exchange was a condition for acquiring the Dish video business,"" the spokesperson said in an email Tuesday. ""Given the outcome of the EchoStar exchange, DirecTV will have no choice but to terminate the acquisition of Dish by midnight on Nov. 22.""

DirecTV does not plan to offer further concessions, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential information. Further progress could be made if Dish and co-founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen were to come to the negotiating table, though that currently seems unlikely, said one of the people.

DirecTV, which will soon be wholly owned by private equity firm TPG , would have assumed roughly $10 billion worth of Dish debt and paid a nominal $1 to acquire Dish DBS, which includes both Dish and Sling TV. But the initial deal was quickly contested by a group of bondholders. DirecTV made a revised offer that valued Dish bonds at a little more than 70 cents on the dollar.

Bloomberg was first to report on DirecTV's plans.

Those bondholders, who constitute a sizable portion of Dish's creditor base, rejected the renewed offer earlier this week.

The likely collapse of the deal would leave Dish in a difficult financial position. Pay TV has been in a long and accelerating decline, and Dish parent company EchoStar on Tuesday reported earnings that disappointed investors, sending shares plunging nearly 13%.

A representative for EchoStar didn't immediately return a request for comment. A representative for TPG didn't immediately provide a comment.",2024-11-12 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/directv-says-dish-purchase-is-off-.html,cnbc
A Chinese EV maker's bet on driver-assist tech is finally paying off — its shares are up more than 80% this year,"As driver-assist systems gain traction in China, one local startup that invested in the tech years ago is finally seeing results. Xpeng , listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, has delivered more than 30,000 cars a month since November. The company last week said it expects that pace to continue for a doubling in sales versus 2024 — and that it will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter. What's selling is the company's lower-priced Mona M03 and its Xpeng-branded P7+ car, which includes advanced driver-assist software at no extra cost. With the automaker's plans to upgrade the P7 and release other new cars this year, Bank of America analysts on March 18 said they ""expect the strong model pipeline to support Xpeng's strong volume growth in 2025-26."" The analysts raised their price target on the stock to $27, up from $18.60 previously. That's upside of more than 20% from Thursday's close. Bank of America rates Xpeng a buy. The electric car company's shares have pulled back slightly after briefly doubling in price on a year-to-date basis earlier this month. Xpeng has ""turned around its sales momentum"" in the last 12 months thanks to its lower-priced Mona-branded M03 and Xpeng-branded P7+ launches, Barclays analysts said in a Thursday report. ""While the product pipeline looks impressive, needless to say the ultimate customer acceptance of these new models depends on many factors in the highly competitive Chinese EV market,"" the analysts said. They raised their price target to $20, from $7 previously, while maintaining an underweight rating. The price target increases come as industry giant BYD last week announced ultra-fast charging technology, on top of its launch in February of driver-assist systems for a range of its cars — signaling the once niche feature is going mainstream. BYD shares are up around 45% year-to-date in Hong Kong. The ""Chinese market is [at] an autonomous driving turning point,"" said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. She pointed out that electric car companies in China are offering not only basic driver-assist known as L2, but moving on to more autonomous features known as L3. Fully autonomous driving without a human driver is called L4. ""What this means for automakers who don't offer free L2 autonomy in China today (like Tesla), is that they will most likely start to offer L2 autonomy for free and start to release and charge fees for L3 autonomy features in the [near] future,"" she said. Xpeng made driver-assist its selling point from its early days; in 2023 its former head of autonomous driving even went to work at Nvidia, which sells chipsets for assisted driving. Xpeng cars use some of those chips. But despite the tech features, the startup's early cars didn't gain significant traction in China until the launch of mass-market brand Mona last summer. A version of Xpeng's more advanced driver-assist system for navigating city streets is also coming for the Mona brand as a higher-end ""Max"" version of the M03 is due for release in May, Xpeng management said in an earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. The car is set to be priced around 150,000 yuan ($20,690). ""Consensus 2025 earnings for Xpeng have been raised by 10% in the past one month and our forecasts remain above the street,"" J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific autos analysts said in a report Wednesday. They have an overweight rating on the stock. ""We revise our forecasts to reflect stronger sales volume but higher R & D expense as well as more conservative pricing,"" the analysts said. They lowered their price target to $31 a share, down from $35 previously. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-03-23 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/23/chinese-ev-maker-xpengs-bet-on-driver-assist-tech-is-finally-paying-off.html,cnbc
China's 'Fab Four' tech stocks are stealing the spotlight from the U.S.,"The difference between Chinese and U.S. stocks is only getting clearer. The S & P 500 fell into correction on Thursday for the first time since 2023 . Meanwhile, the MSCI China index has surged double digits in its best start to a year in history, largely thanks to artificial intelligence, according to Goldman Sachs. Driving Chinese market gains are what Bank of America's Michael Hartnett calls the ""Fab Four"" — Baidu , Alibaba , Tencent and Xiaomi . The tech companies' stocks are all traded in Hong Kong; Baidu and Alibaba also have U.S.-listed shares. Invoking the popularity of The Beatles reflects the momentum with which the Chinese tech giants have risen on AI hopes. Alibaba and Tencent have in recent weeks both released AI models they claim rival those from DeepSeek and OpenAI, while the Chinese tech giants each have massive user bases given their respective dominance in the country's e-commerce and social media industries. Alibaba on Thursday unveiled an updated version of its 200 million-user Quark browser with faster AI-generated results. Baidu has built its own AI model called Ernie that it's been rolling out across its cloud storage and content generation apps. The company also develops autonomous driving and operates robotaxis across China. Xiaomi has downplayed its AI capabilities, instead focusing on its popular SU7 electric car , a swath of smartphones and internet-connected home appliances. The stock is on pace for its ninth-straight month of gains. It's a ""Year of International – long China & EU,"" Hartnett said, saying the U.S.'s "" Magnificent 7 "" is now the ""Lagnificent 7."" The CNBC Magnificent 7 Index — which includes Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla — is down about 12% year to date as of Friday. Even as of March 6, the DeepSeek news had triggered $3 trillion in market cap losses for the Magnificent 7, while doubling the market cap of the Fab Four to $1.6 trillion, according to Bank of America. Since Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI breakthrough hit markets in late January, Beijing has ramped up its supportive signals on Chinese tech, while investors have become more interested in AI announcements from Alibaba and other Chinese companies. Initial Chinese stock gains have already started to fuel expectations that the local market will see its own version of the AI-driven rally that the U.S. saw in the last two years. ""In the U.S., the AI rally rotated from AI infrastructure to AI enablers and then AI adopters. It's a similar pattern in China,"" HSBC analysts said earlier this month. They noted a ""large valuation gap"" between Chinese AI plays versus their U.S. peers, which could narrow as growth and profits pick up. Investors inside and outside China are getting more interested. Hong Kong stocks, particularly Alibaba and Tencent, saw net buys from mainland Chinese investors reach a record high on Monday . For international institutions, short-term hedge funds led most of the buying in February, while interest from longer-term investors has started to emerge this month, Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, told reporters Wednesday in Beijing. ""As concerns about the U.S. economy and U.S. markets [grow], their interest may increase,"" he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. But he cautioned it's not a given, and said research indicates U.S. consumers may not feel much impact until a 20% drop in stocks. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-03-16 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/16/chinas-fab-four-tech-stocks-are-stealing-the-spotlight-from-the-us.html,cnbc
China needs to boost its tech sector more than ever. How to play it,"Chinese tech companies raced to launch new products in a week that saw Beijing double down on its calls to support artificial intelligence. An obscure Chinese startup that goes by the name Monica on Wednesday announced an invite-only AI application called Manus that claims to streamline analysis of resumes and financial information using several models from companies such as OpenAI, DeepSeek and Anthropic. ""The innovation is probably not as significant as DeepSeek,“ in our view, Nomura China technology analyst Bing Duan and a team wrote Thursday. ""However, we believe this product is yet another example of China's accelerated AI innovation."" ""We believe that the AI infrastructure investment upcycle has started in China's AI value chain, which should benefit from leading suppliers exposed to China's major Internet/Telecom companies' capex on cloud and AI infrastructure,"" the analysts said. Three of their picks are mainland China-listed printed circuit board companies that have partnerships with China AI tech leaders, according to Nomura: Shennan Circuits, Shengyi Technology and WUS PCB. The firm also likes Shenzhen-listed Accelink for its position as a leading supplier of optical transceivers which can facilitate the high-speed data transmissions needed to develop AI. Nomura rates all four stocks as buys. Tech's leadership in Chinese stocks As China faces increased tariffs and slowing economic growth, policymakers in the last week announced a rare increase in its deficit — along with plans to ramp up subsidies for consumer trade-ins and financing for tech companies. Several senior officials publicly lauded the rise of DeepSeek AI, and they emphasized how restrictions have only pushed Chinese companies to work harder on tech. The messaging on technology is ""encouraging, a strong signal to support both innovation and the private sector,"" Nicholas Yeo, head of China equities at abrdn, said in a note. ""With valuations of the internet sector cheap relative to U.S. counterparts, alongside the support of the authorities to boost the nation's AI capabilities, we think this remain a very attractive opportunity for investors,"" he said. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 5.6% last week while hitting a three-year high. The CSI 300 fell by about 1.4% for the week. Tech has led most of the recent gains in Chinese stocks, which is reflected in the outperformance of the Hang Seng Index versus mainland Chinese stocks, known as A shares, said Aaron Costello, head of Asia at Cambridge Associates. He pointed out that most major Chinese tech names are traded in Hong Kong. If China's stimulus starts to see economic results, A shares should see another leg up as gains broaden out, he said. Tencent and AI Helping the Hang Seng Index's gains was a surge in Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares to a new 52-week high. The e-commerce company revealed a new AI reasoning model that it claims performs just as well as DeepSeek's R1 model. Tencent , also traded in Hong Kong, a week earlier launched the latest version of its Hunyuan AI model, Turbo S, which claims to beat DeepSeek V3 , OpenAI's GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.1 on certain key metrics such as MMLU, Math and Chinese. Tencent also released a new T1 reasoning model based on the Turbo S. The T1 is currently accessible through the Yuanbao app, which says it also offers DeepSeek access. ""We'd argue the last few weeks have presented ample evidence in favor of Tencent's ability to productionize AI,"" Bernstein China Internet analyst Robin Zhu and a team said in a report Wednesday that named Tencent their top China AI play. ""Tencent's recent moves on implementing DeepSeek within its family of apps make it clear that this was one of the times Tencent's top management decided the troops must be rallied for a common goal,"" the analysts said. ""The company has moved quickly to implement DeepSeek across its family of digital ecosystems — including WeChat and AI assistant Yuanbao, but also Peacekeeper Elite within the video gaming portfolio."" The Bernstein analysts raised their price target on Tencent to 640 Hong Kong dollars, up from 540 HKD, for upside of 20% from Friday's close. The firm rates the stock overweight. ""Tencent's AI assistant Yuanbao is now being downloaded at a faster rate than both Bytedance's Doubao and the DeepSeek app,"" the analysts said. ""Social advertising is a tried and tested monetisation pathway for AI advancements, and Yuanbao growth potentially sets up a larger search ads business over time."" Tencent is set to release quarterly results on March 19. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-03-09 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/09/china-needs-to-boost-its-tech-sector-more-than-ever-how-to-play-it.html,cnbc
China investing risks haven’t gone away. Wall Street shares some of its safer plays,"As excitement over DeepSeek moderated, JPMorgan gave its clients a warning: ""Be careful: U.S.-China risks back in focus."" The Feb. 24 note cautioned that the White House's new America First Investment Policy could trigger a pullback in Chinese stocks after the recent rally. Indeed, on Thursday U.S. President Donald Trump said an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods would be coming on March 4. Duties of 25% on Canada and Mexico would also be implemented on that date, he said. Stocks in Hong Kong and mainland China fell Friday on the news. JPMorgan's stock recommendations for names to add included three Chinese real estate-related companies: U.S.-listed KE Holdings and China Resources Land and China Overseas Land and Investment (known as CR Land and Coli, respectively) both traded in Hong Kong. The investment firm rates all three stocks overweight. KE Holdings operates a major brokerage for apartment rentals and home sales in China. CR Land and Coli are two state-owned companies that develop and manage residential and commercial properties in China. ""In the coming weeks, we anticipate that Defensive and Value may outperform Growth and that A-shares may outperform offshore listed China/HK equity indices while the market debates downside related to the new"" America First Investment Policy, JPMorgan's chief China equity strategist Wendy Liu and a team wrote in the report. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.3% for the week after hitting a three-year high Thursday. The CSI 300 index of major Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks fell 2.2% for the week. ""We believe China is the real focus of the Trump administration and posit that a significant worsening of tensions between the worlds' two largest economies might be inevitable,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note Thursday afternoon Beijing time. ""While markets currently appear to be ignoring these risks, they could come to the forefront in coming months,"" he said. The new America First Investment Policy has also caught analysts' attention for its revived focus on Chinese companies with alleged Chinese military affiliations, and on an audit dispute that recently threatened the delisting of Chinese stocks in the U.S. That issue was resolved temporarily in late 2022. ""Rising U.S. policy uncertainty, including tariff risks, underscores the importance of [China] delivering forceful macro policy stimulus, boosting private sector confidence, and aiding high-quality and tech (AI) development,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Feb. 25 note. In a separate report the following day, the analysts detailed several stock baskets, including one for Asia Pacific ex-Japan domestic consumption that could benefit from additional support due out at China's so-called Two Sessions that kicks off in the week ahead. The top three Chinese names by basket weight, at 10% each, are Meituan Dianping , Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and its rival PDD Holdings . Hong Kong-listed Meituan Dianping operates apps for food delivery, discovering nearby attractions and getting restaurant deals. The Goldman basket picked Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares, while Pinduoduo and Temu parent PDD trades in the U.S. Coincidentally, analysis from HSBC found that while U.S. investors have the largest positions in Alibaba, Tencent and Meituan, most of the positions are via U.S. mutual funds and are not affected by the White House's latest policy focus on investments by government pensions and endowment funds. Despite looming U.S. tensions, China's economic outlook will be front and center in the week ahead. On Wednesday, China is expected to officially raise the deficit and detail stimulus plans , but acknowledge weaker domestic demand with the softest inflation outlook in just over 20 years. The moves follow a high-level directive in September to halt the property sector's decline. Macquarie's chief China economist Larry Hu shared Friday three positive signals for the housing market with growing hopes for a bottom this year. He pointed out that housing inventories are due to return to normal levels by the end of the year, while policymakers keen on stopping the decline now seem willing to bail out Vanke, a major developer. In addition, Hu said that rental yields are starting to climb above that of China's 10-year government bond yield, making housing more attractive relative to other long-term assets. Foreign capital is starting to act on new Chinese real estate investment opportunities, particularly given a Beijing policy push to increase rental housing . Invesco last week announced its real estate investment arm formed a joint venture with Ziroom, a Chinese company known locally for its standardized, modern-style apartment rentals. Part of the opportunity comes from how traditional developers are less financially able to participate right now, Calvin Chou, head of APAC, Invesco Real Estate, said in an interview. ""We think there's a good runway here."" The joint venture, called Izara Holdings, plans to initially invest 1.2 billion yuan (about $160 million) in a 1,500-room rental housing development near one of the sites for Beijing's Winter Olympics, with a targeted opening of 2027. Ziroom's digital system allows the company to quickly assess regional factors to improve operational efficiency of the rental units and control investment risks, Ziroom Asset Management CEO Meng Yue said in a statement, adding that joint venture plans to tap not only a new stage of China's real estate market, but eventually overseas markets. Ziroom is privately held. It's a client of KE Holdings, which disclosed in annual reports that it has sold online marketing and agency services to Ziroom. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-03-02 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/02/china-investing-risks-arent-gone-wall-street-shares-its-safer-plays.html,cnbc
Alibaba shares have soared on China AI hopes. Here’s where analysts see the stock heading next,"Alibaba is back in the spotlight — with U.S.-traded shares soaring nearly 70% so far in 2025 — as a favored play on Chinese artificial intelligence. The company said Thursday its AI-related product revenue grew by triple digits for a sixth-straight quarter in the period ended December. Its Qwen AI model has proven itself a capable rival to DeepSeek , along with winning a deal for iPhones sold in China . Founder Jack Ma, once politically sidelined, made his latest public reappearance on Feb. 17 — with a front-row seat at a rare meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping held with entrepreneurs , including DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng. Several analysts think Alibaba's gains will continue, with Jefferies setting a $156 price target as of Feb. 20. That's upside of more than 8% from Friday's close of $143.75. UBS equity strategists on Thursday said they have switched out PDD for Alibaba in a model portfolio ""given its exposure to AI and quant factors."" Remember how just several months ago the Temu parent had a larger market cap , raising concerns that Alibaba was struggling to compete on its core e-commerce business? Taobao and Tmall Group saw sales rise 5% in the latest quarter. As excited as many investors are about AI opportunities in China, crowding into related stocks has only picked up by 0.02 so far this year on UBS's scoring system. That's far below the increase of 0.2 in the crowding score for U.S. AI-related names over the last two years, UBS said. Alibaba had the highest crowding score among large Chinese internet technology names, the report said. ""Our Quants team's analysis previously suggested that stocks with reasonable but improving crowding have seen the most near-term outperformance."" Hong Kong's Hang Seng index hit a three-year high Friday with China Unicom, Lenovo and Alibaba's locally traded shares leading gains. ""Should investors rotate from Alibaba to the AI trade laggers (i.e. Tencent and Baidu)? Not for now,"" JPMorgan internet analyst Alex Yao wrote in a Feb. 17 note. ""We think both Tencent and Baidu's share prices could be driven by AI development in different ways with different risks."" U.S.-listed shares of Baidu are up by about 8% for the year so far, despite the company sharing on Feb. 18 that its AI Cloud revenue rose 26% year-on-year to 7.1 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. Hong Kong-traded shares of Tencent , which has yet to report earnings for the period, have risen by about 24% for the year so far. JPMorgan is neutral on Baidu, but overweight on Tencent and Alibaba. The firm has a price target of $125 on Alibaba shares, suggesting a 13% decline from Friday's close. At least four other major investment firms have a buy rating on Alibaba. But Morgan Stanley is notably more cautious with an equal-weight rating and a price target of $100. That would imply a drop of 30% from Friday's close. The firm pointed out that Alibaba's capital expenditures were 11% of revenue in the latest quarter, versus 3% in the prior quarter — a potential weight on future margins that management warned about. Morgan Stanley also highlighted risks such as weaker consumption and a slower pace of enterprise digitalization. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-02-23 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/23/alibaba-rose-on-china-ai-hopes-where-analysts-see-the-stock-heading.html,cnbc
Analysts like these stocks to play EV-maker BYD’s new driver-assist rollout,"As electric car giant BYD gets serious about driver-assistance systems, analysts expect its suppliers can benefit. Shares of the Hong Kong-listed automaker hit a record high in the past week after the company launched a driver-assistance system for a range of its cars, including one of its low-cost models priced below 70,000 yuan (roughly $9,600). BYD also said it's integrating DeepSeek's artificial intelligence capabilities. Companies that sell parts for BYD's new driver-assist system ""are likely to enjoy solid growth ahead,"" Nomura analysts said in a note Tuesday. ""Meanwhile, we believe more [car manufacturers] will have to accelerate their smart driving functions upgrade in order to catch up with peers, and this may result in increasing demand for smart driving-related components in the entire auto market,"" the analysts said. Their picks include the automaker's Hong Kong-listed subsidiary BYD Electronics , which makes autonomous driving components, Hong Kong-traded chipmaker Horizon Robotics and lidar developer Hesai Tech , listed in the U.S. Lidar is short for light detection and ranging. In driver-assist systems, a lidar sensor uses lasers to create a 3D map of a car's surroundings. Driver-assist features have increasingly become a selling point for automakers in China's competitive electric car market. Tesla , whose Full Self-Driving has yet to get China's approval, saw its shares tumble on Tuesday following the news of BYD's driver-assist rollout. China's efforts to build tech self-reliance and U.S. restrictions have supported the development of a homegrown ecosystem. BYD's driver-assist announcements Monday were focused on the China market, rather than the automaker's export business. Beijing-based Horizon Robotics is one of BYD's major chips suppliers. BYD's founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu said at a Horizon Robotics event last year that the future of electric cars would rely on semiconductors. Goldman Sachs analyst Allen Chang on Monday raised his price target on Horizon Robotics to 6.95 Hong Kong dollars (89 cents), up from 6.10 HKD previously, based on expectations of higher earnings. The firm rates the stock a buy. ""With another push by major car [manufacturers] to bring smart driving to lower-priced cars, we are positive on the ability of Horizon Robotics, as one of the leading smart driving chip providers in China, to obtain more design-wins with its Journey 6 new chipset series,"" the report said. Chang expects the Journey 6 series to grow from 3% of the chip company's revenue this year to 40% in 2027. Shares have already soared more than 60% year to date as of Thursday's close at 5.88 HKD. In a separate note Monday, Goldman analyst Verena Jeng raised her price target on buy-rated BYD Electronics to 58.46 HKD, up from 51.02 HKD previously. The stock has gained more than 30% so far this year to 56 HKD as of Thursday's close. The Goldman report noted expectations that more than 3 million BYD cars will adopt advanced driver-assist this year, and pointed out that since the systems are pricier than, say an automotive speaker, that will increase how much revenue BYD Electronics can generate per car. BYD's ""Dipilot"" driver-assist system uses different components depending on price point. The most basic one uses Horizon Robotics' chipset along with Nvidia 's Orin, while more advanced versions only use other Nvidia chips, according to Nomura's research. The driver-assist versions that support driving on city streets use lidar from companies such as Hesai, Nomura pointed out. While Hesai is contesting U.S. government allegations that it supports the Chinese military, Goldman Sachs analysts in mid-January upgraded the U.S.-listed stock to a buy from neutral, citing the company's new product cycle, according to FactSet. The analysts raised their price target on Hesai to $18.40 from $5.50. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-02-16 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/16/stocks-to-play-ev-maker-byds-new-driver-assist-rollout.html,cnbc
DeepSeek's AI breakthrough could get global investors interested in China again,"DeepSeek's rise is the catalyst that will prompt global investors to allocate more toward Chinese stocks, even as economic worries persist, analysts predict. ""Before the overarching talk was, China is uninvestible. … Now you definitely see people start thinking it probably helps to have China,"" said Liqian Ren, leader of quantitative investment at WisdomTree. It's a realization that ""the macro environment can be still cool in China and you still see innovation,"" Ren said, adding she expects progress in the next few years in Chinese drug development and other areas. ""DeepSeek is the tip of what's likely to come."" The Chinese AI startup released an open-source model in January that surprised many U.S. tech investors with the ability to share its thought process and claims to undercut OpenAI drastically on costs — despite U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors. High-flying U.S. chip giant Nvidia plunged about 17% on Jan. 27 in its worst day since 2020 as global tech stocks dropped . The development ""raises questions about the vast sums that are currently being invested in AI and whether it will turn out to be money well spent,"" David Chao global market strategist, Asia Pacific, ex-Japan, at Invesco, said in a Feb. 3 note. ""I expect the current high concentration in the US stock market to be a temporary phenomenon."" ""I would just add that it favors an equally weighted approach to the US market, US small-mid caps over mega caps and Chinese equities vs US equities,"" he said. ""Chinese equities, and especially Chinese technology companies are priced at a steep discount compared to their American counterparts, and similar to the AI development gap narrowing, so too is the valuation gap."" DeepSeek shows how some Chinese tech giants can build AI models comparable to U.S. ones, ""which can be tactically bullish for MSCI China on the back of subdued valuation, light positioning, and recovering earnings cycle,"" Louis Luo, head of multi-asset investment solutions, Greater China, abrdn, said in a Feb. 5 note. The MSCI China index includes Hong Kong and mainland-traded stocks. While DeepSeek is not publicly listed, investment analysts expect several Chinese stocks can benefit from local AI development. ""Kingdee and Kingsoft Office remain our top names to gain exposure to the AI themes,"" Bernstein's Boris Van and Ting Ming Neo said in a Feb. 5 report. They expect Hong Kong-listed software company Kingdee can benefit due to its large base of small and medium-sized businesses, strong product positioning and subscription model. ""The stock is well positioned for a macro recovery should private enterprise budgets resume later in the year, presenting upside to current estimates, with the AI story largely not yet priced in today,"" the Bernstein analysts said. They are more cautious in the near term about Shanghai-listed Kingsoft Office, operator of word-processing app WPS, due to uncertainty about how its enterprise AI business can succeed. ""Long term AI winner but find the right entry point in 1H,"" the analysts said. They rate both stocks outperform. Within China stocks likely to benefit from rising AI adoption, J.P. Morgan China equity strategists also like Kingdee more than Kingsoft Office. ""DeepSeek's low cost and quality AI data infrastructure should help raise the installation and revenue base for AI enabled software applications,"" they said in a Feb. 3 note. The firm highlighted Kingdee as a preferred pick. They pointed out that while businesses have not spent much on software due to slow growth, government offices in China have been digitizing data and processes to improve efficiency. The J.P. Morgan China strategists also expect increased availability of AI applications to encourage consumers to buy new smartphones more frequently. Among the publicly-traded Chinese players, they like Hong Kong-listed Xiaomi the best as they expect Lenovo will be more affected by tariffs. The team rates Xiaomi overweight. HSBC analysts on Feb. 6 raised their revenue estimates for Xiaomi partly on expectations of better smartphone and connected home appliance sales. They pointed out that Xiaomi has an in-house AI large model team and strategic cooperation with Kingsoft Cloud and AI startup MiniMax. ""With the rise of low-cost models such as DeepSeek-R1 and the gradual maturity of AI computing infrastructures, we believe Xiaomi will benefit as one of the top global edge AI players,"" the HSBC analysts said, referring to on-device AI. More interest outside the state sector Chinese stocks still face U.S. tariff uncertainty, and questions remain about how quickly the world's second-largest economy can grow this year without sufficient support. WisdomTree's Ren cautioned that China investors might face ""very painful"" periods due to the barrage of headline-driven volatility. She added that new buyers are likely increasing their allocation from emerging markets rather than U.S. stocks. But there are other indications that the winds have shifted. Interest in China started to pick up after Beijing's stimulus announcements in late September, Ren pointed out. What's different now, she said, is that DeepSeek's latest artificial intelligence breakthroughs are showing innovation coming out of China's private, non-state owned sector. The WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE) was up nearly 4% for the year as of Thursday's close.

Analysts list these Chinese stock plays to help investors ride out tariff volatility,"Tariffs or not, Chinese markets are still waiting for earnings to turn around, analysts point out. ""Regardless of what the number of the tariffs are for China, it comes back to the domestic stimulus for China and whether China can alleviate the deflation pressures,"" Aaron Costello, head of Asia at Cambridge Associates, said Thursday. Beijing ""has clearly shown a desire"" to stimulate the economy, Costello said, noting details are due out at an annual parliamentary meeting in March. ""The potential for Chinese equities to rebound sharply is there, so we don't want to be underweight China, we want to be neutral,"" he said. Chinese stocks closed higher Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump 's latest comments indicated reluctance to raise tariffs , despite threatening a day earlier that 10% duties could come as soon as Feb. 1. The mainland market also got a lift Thursday after financial regulators effectively mandated state-backed insurers to buy more stocks . While the directive offers longer-term support for stocks, ""we reiterate our preference for the A-share market, and for stocks with stable cash returns and decent dividend yields ,"" Morgan Stanley's Chief China Equity Strategist Laura Wang said in a note Thursday. She referred to the firm's report on Jan. 20 for a list of ""well positioned"" names. Morgan Stanley surveyed its analysts for Chinese stocks for which they expected to see solid earnings growth in the year ahead. The stocks must be rated overweight or equalweight, have a market capitalization of more than $2 billion and average daily trading turnover of more than $2 million. The three names with the highest expected earnings growth for 2025 are: Espressif Systems — The Shanghai-listed company develops chip sets for home appliances. Earlier this month it said its net profit more than doubled in 2024 . SICC — Founded in 2010, the Shanghai-listed company produces silicon carbide substrate, used in semiconductors. It said in December it plans to list in Hong Kong at an unspecified date . Zijin Mining — The Hong Kong-listed mining company, which extracts metals such as copper, gold, zinc and lithium, said net profit in the third quarter rose by more than 50% from a year ago. Morgan Stanley expects each company can grow earnings per share by at least 40% in 2025. ""Quality earnings beats becoming a proven alpha generator in the China equity space and should continue to be so,"" the analysts said in the Jan. 20 report. They said Chinese stocks have missed earnings expectations for 13 straight quarters since late 2021. But in their historical analysis of stock performance between 2021 and 2024, they found that earnings beats and upward revisions led to significant outperformance versus companies that missed or had earnings estimates cut. Overseas revenue has increasingly become a growth driver for Chinese companies as they face a slower economy at home. And despite worries about geopolitics hitting cross-border e-commerce, Bernstein analysts pointed out in a Wednesday note that the market outside the U.S. is ""as big, if not bigger than the U.S. one."" Total e-commerce gross merchandise value in the U.S. was $1.1 trillion in 2023, while the next 29 markets for which eMarketer has data had a total GMV of $1.5 trillion, Bernstein said. Bernstein analysts expect PDD and Alibaba earnings to grow in the year ahead, but the only one they rate outperform is the Temu parent. They have a price target of $150 a share on PDD, for upside of more than 40% from Thursday's close. ""From an investing standpoint, our sense is global (and in particular US) investors take a very US-centric view of Temu, and what it means for PDD's shares,"" the analysts said. ""In contrast, we'd argue that Temu's US experience in the past 12-18 months — showing a large jump in profitability once new user acquisition was de-emphasised — demonstrates the path to profitability elsewhere."" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-01-26 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/26/analysts-list-these-chinese-stock-plays-to-help-investors-ride-out-tariff-volatility.html,cnbc
Citigroup picks high-yield stocks to play China as tariffs loom on the horizon,"As Chinese markets prepare for higher tariffs and hope for more government stimulus , Citigroup analysts say some of their top picks are high-yielding mainland stocks. ""Yield plays in the A-share market have become more attractive amid the government bond yield drop,"" Citi China equity strategists said in a report last week, referring to stocks that trade in mainland China. The persistent decline in China's 10-year government bond yield — to record lows around 1.58% this month— prompted the People's Bank of China on Jan. 10 to stop its government bond purchases . The yield has traded little changed around 1.64% in the week since. Citi analysts say the Chinese 10-year government bond yield can fall still further, given expectations that in the year ahead the PBOC will cut interest rates by 50 basis points and the required reserve ratio — the amount of cash banks need to keep on hand — by 100 basis points. One basis point equals 1/100th of a percentage point (0.01%). Meanwhile, rising U.S. Treasury yields, at least partly on expectations of tariff-induced inflation in the U.S., helped send Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbling more than 8% between early December and mid-January, Citi said. Mainland Chinese stocks held up better, falling 6% — which Citi analysts attributed to easier monetary policy and falling Chinese government bond yields. Three of Citi's top mainland Chinese stock picks by yield are Shanghai-listed electric bus company Yutong Bus and two Shenzhen-listed names: Gree Electric Appliances and Ping An Bank . Long-term investors have preferred China high-yield stocks for years, and the advantages have become more apparent with slower economic growth and lower bond yields, said Ye Yuhua, money manager at Guangzhou-based Liangdian Private Capital. Banks and home appliance stocks have tended to see yields of 4% to 6%, far above the sub-2% government bond yield benchmark, he said. The concern, however, is that high dividend yields are not necessarily a given, especially for stocks sensitive to commodity prices. Unpacking the tariff impact President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose additional tariffs of at least 10% on Chinese goods soon after his inauguration on Monday. Citi economists expect U.S. tariffs to kick in starting in the second quarter and increase in stages of around 15 percentage points, which they estimate could hit China's exports by 6% and GDP by 1%. Citi analysts said that based on recent meetings with Chinese officials in several departments, their ""key takeaway was that China is aiming at steady economic growth, which would hinge [on] external tariffs and domestic stimulus."" The analysts anticipate a short-term stock rally in March if the U.S. and China reach an agreement to gradually hike tariffs. ""But this is unlikely to alter the deflationary outlook in China or resolve structural issues,"" the Citi analysts said, noting they expect ""high dividend yield bank stocks [will] become more attractive to yield-seeking onshore investors."" China on Friday reported GDP grew by 5% in 2024 , matching government targets. But when accounting for lower prices and other deflationary pressure, the economy expanded by just 4.2% in 2024, pointed out Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie. The ability of policymakers to turn around an almost two-year-long deflationary trend will depend on the effectiveness of fiscal policy and support for the real estate market. Chinese authorities have pledged to increase the fiscal deficit at an annual parliamentary meeting in March, when they're also expected to reveal other stimulus measures. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2025-01-19 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/19/citigroup-picks-high-yield-stocks-to-play-china-as-tariffs-loom.html,cnbc
Analysts' top stock picks for playing China's 2025 consumer stimulus plan,"China economic policy kicked off 2025 with an expanded consumer stimulus program that analysts expect will benefit a handful of specific stocks. While the country has rejected handing out cash directly to consumers, since late summer it has subsidized some home appliance purchases through a trade-in program. Officials on Wednesday added microwaves, water purifiers, dishwashers and rice cookers to an existing list of eight product categories eligible for subsidies of up to 20% the retail price. ""The new measures should mostly benefit leading home appliance manufacturers like Midea , Gree and Haier ,"" Morningstar equity analyst Jeff Zhang said in a mid-week note. The companies were the top three air conditioner producers by revenue in China last year. ""We lift our 2025-28 revenue forecasts on Midea, Haier and Gree by 2%-5% to reflect higher sales expectations,"" Zhang said. He also raised 12-month price targets on all three stocks. Midea's Hong Kong-listed shares gained nearly 38% last year. Shares could soar about 26% from Friday's close based on Morningstar's price target of 96.70 Hong Kong dollars. After gaining 29% last year, Haier's Hong Kong-listed shares still have nearly 48% upside, measured from Friday's close to Morningstar's price target of HKD 38.90. Gree, traded in Shenzhen, saw its shares surge by nearly 50% last year. Morningstar has a price target of 51 yuan, equal to about 10% upside from Friday's close. Citigroup analysts maintained their buy ratings on the same three Chinese home appliance stocks after Wednesday's consumer stimulus announcement. Citi has higher price targets than Morningstar on all three: 64.50 yuan for Gree, HKD 50.60 for Haier and HKD 119.30 for Midea. Risks to growth However, Citi cautioned that price wars and further weakness in the real estate market could also weigh on the stock prices. Home appliance prices fell by 3.3% in December from a year ago, according to official data released Thursday. The figures underscored how consumer demand in China has remained lackluster since the pandemic as households stay focused on future income. China is due to release retail sales and full-year GDP numbers on Friday Jan. 17. The latest stimulus policy said consumers who benefited from home appliance subsidies in 2024 can enjoy them again this year. The eight product categories on last year's list were refrigerators, washing machines, television sets, air conditioners, computers, water heaters, household stoves and range hoods. Officials said Wednesday they already allocated 81 billion yuan ($11.05 billion) to support the trade-in subsidies this year through the Spring Festival, which runs from late January to early February. Subsidies for the full year are due to be announced at an annual parliamentary meeting in early March. In the last several months, China's major e-commerce platforms have highlighted how they've benefited from the trade-in subsidies program. Among the companies, JD.com remains Citi internet analysts' top pick for playing the consumer stimulus program in the year ahead, according to a Jan. 8 note. ""JD.com is relatively better/positioned to benefit from the continuation of this supportive trade-in program especially given its prior experience, prepared system and procedures and strong supply chain capabilities to capture growing demand on this new round of trade-in initiatives,"" the Citi analysts said. More electronics, less food Relative to its peers, JD.com tends to sell more electronics and home appliances than clothes or food. But there is increasing product overlap as the e-commerce platforms have grown over the years. Alibaba is Citi's second favorite e-commerce play on the Chinese consumer stimulus policy. The online shopping giant sells products from large brands on its Tmall platform, and smaller merchants through Taobao. ""Thanks to Tmall's strength with major brands and their large distributors, Baba will also likely benefit from the positive policy,"" the analysts said. They expect PDD will benefit less relative to JD and Alibaba. Citi has a price target of $51 on JD's U.S.-traded American depositary receipts , and $133 on Alibaba ADRs, implying upside of 54% and 65%, respectively, from Friday's close.",2025-01-12 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/12/analysts-stock-picks-for-playing-chinas-2025-consumer-stimulus-plan.html,cnbc
Air China tapped as prime candidate to rebound among struggling mainland carriers,"Analysts are pointing to Hong Kong-traded Air China as the leading turnaround candidate among struggling Chinese airlines. China has been far slower than the U.S. to recover from the shock of the 2020-2023 pandemic as the world's second-largest economy faces its own unique challenges. But among several analysts, ranging from DBS to Citigroup, Beijing-based Air China is the top pick for playing a sustained pickup in Chinese travel at home and abroad. Air China, part of United Airline 's Star Alliance group, ""is the only Chinese network carrier serving all six continents across the globe, with a particularly strong presence in the profitable China-to-Europe and China-to-North America routes,"" DBS analysts Jason Sum and Paul Yong said in a report Thursday. DBS maintained its buy rating, with a price target of 5.60 Hong Kong dollars (72 cents), implying upside of 13% from Air China's close Friday. 753-HK 5Y line Air China 60% below peak While 2024 saw Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rally nearly 18%, Air China saw a more muted, low single-digit increase that left it trading more than 60% below its 2018 all-time high. That gives Air China a ""significantly more attractive"" valuation, close to its five-year pre-pandemic average, the DBS analysts said. ""A stronger-than-expected generation of cash flows will enable the group to deleverage swiftly and repair its battered balance sheet."" The upcoming Lunar New Year, which runs from late January to early February, could provide a boost. Chinese booking site Trip.com noted that interest in international travel over the holiday is way up . Ticket demand for travel from mainland China to parts of Europe is up by about 50% from a year ago, while inbound demand has tripled, with travelers coming both from nearby Japan and the distant U.S., Trip.com said in a forecast Tuesday. Expanded visa-free travel Chinese authorities in recent months have expanded visa-free policies for travelers from several countries, including parts of Europe and, notably, Japan. Citi analysts in early December reiterated their buy rating on Air China, calling it their top travel stock pick among Chinese airlines. They expect the government's economic policy will support consumption in the coming year. JPMorgan analysts in late November expressed similar optimism, citing Air China's greater exposure to international travel than rivals, and its roughly 30% stake in Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific . The analysts upgraded Air China to overweight from neutral — reversing a downgrade made in early October, according to FactSet. The JPM analysts also raised their price target to HKD5.90 based on expectations for significant improvement in earnings over the next two years. The JPM analysts also expect airlines to benefit from lower fuel costs if President-elect Donald Trump carries through on pledges to further reduce energy prices . U.S. airline stocks have outperformed the S & P 500 since early October, the JPMorgan analysts said. Back in early November, Goldman Sachs analysts had already named Air China a ""main beneficiary"" of increased business travel and resumption in long-haul flights. Goldman expects domestic air passengers grew by 11% in 2024, exceeding 2019 levels, and will expand by another 6% in 2025. The analysts see international traffic recovering to slightly more than 2019 levels in the year ahead. Still, Air China has a long way to go to catch up to its partner United, which closed at a new record in early December and soared 135% in 2024, its largest ever annual gain. Chicago-based United, which operates more international routes than any U.S. airline, has benefited from lower jet fuel costs and a continued recovery in post-pandemic travel demand. — CNBC's Michael Bloom and Sean Conlon contributed to this report",2025-01-05 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/05/air-china-tapped-as-prime-candidate-to-rebound-among-struggling-mainland-carriers-.html,cnbc
China gears up for an uncertain 2025. How investors plan to prepare,"Investor confidence in Chinese earnings' growth remains the missing ingredient to drive a sustained stock market rally in the world's second-largest economy, already barraged by government stimulus measures and the overhang of U.S. tensions. ""For Chinese equities to meaningfully outperform, we need to see the policy announcements result in an actual easing of deflationary pressures and a rebound in corporate earnings, both of which will take time,"" Aaron Costello, head of Asia at Cambridge Associates, said in an email Thursday. The CSI 300 index dipped 1% last week, tumbling 2.4% on Friday alone, after Beijing reaffirmed plans for increasing the deficit next year and expanding economic support , but didn't reveal details. China typically announces its GDP target and fiscal plans at a parliamentary meeting in March. Stocks are now almost 12% below the 52-week high reached in early October. ""It is clear that China is setting the stage to increase stimulus in 2025, potentially to counteract any adverse trade policies from the incoming Trump administration,"" Costello said. Cambridge Associates is neutral on Chinese stocks, wanting to see more evidence of a pickup in growth. Improving earnings Yet despite the broad pressure on the economy, earnings in specific industries are forecast to improve. Chinese medical device companies can see earnings widen next year, especially after the Ministry of Finance earlier this month set a draft of plans that would make it 20% cheaper for local governments to buy domestically produced products versus foreign ones, HSBC analysts said in a Dec. 10 report. While the public comment period closes in early January, implementation is unclear. ""With recovery of China's hospital procurement for medical equipment from September, we foresee a growth rebound for the China medical device sector in 2025,"" the HSBC analysts said. Shanghai-traded United Imaging can see earnings grow 46% in 2025, reversing this year's losses, they predict. Snibe, traded in the Shenzhen market, can see 19% earnings growth, with Mindray profits expected to climb 15%. HSBC rates all three stocks a buy. The new policy favoring domestic brands underscores China's desire to reduce its reliance on exports to the U.S. and American-made high-tech products. The Biden administration has restricted Chinese companies from buying advanced semiconductors made in the U.S., while President-elect Donald Trump has vowed across-the-board, 10% tariffs on Chinese imports . But the exact nature of the next administration's policy toward China is unclear. After ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, Trump also told CNBC's Jim Cramer that ""we're going to have a lot of talks with China. We have a good relationship with China."" Trump cast his previous position on China as overly harsh, while noting how talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping could help address U.S. concerns. Separately on Thursday, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that the President-elect has invited Xi to the Jan. 20 inauguration. Beijing has yet to publicly respond. Limited upside Upside for the MSCI China Index is limited until foreign investors know the scale of Trump's tariffs and sanctions, and see profit growth across China's economy, the Macro Research Board said in a note Wednesday. For now, foreign investors are only interested in trading around potential China policy shifts, but ignoring improving fundamentals, such as how large internet platform companies are seeing ""significant"" improvement in future earnings, the report said. ""The key signal for upgrading positions in Chinese stocks [from neutral] will be found in an improvement in bank earnings,"" the MRB report said, noting that ""the single most important indicator for upgrading China would therefore be a pickup in credit volumes."" Credit data for November released Friday missed the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, and Citigroup analysts pointed out that lower corporate demand was largely responsible. Official figures on November retail sales, industrial production and investment are due out on Monday. ""As much as Beijing wants to stimulate more employment, home buying and consumer spending, [policymakers] also want to avoid encouraging high-debt sectors to take on more debt,"" Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in an email. ""This dilemma is likely to mean more limited support than in the past."" ""2024 provides a good example of what we think is to come,"" Christopher said, referring to how Chinese stocks have whipsawed this year as forecasts of policy support rose and fell. Looking ahead to next year, Christopher said he still favors U.S. large-cap stocks over other asset classes. Those include smaller U.S. stocks and names listed overseas, he said, noting Wells Fargo ""would use any bump higher in emerging market equities to reallocate to U.S. large-caps."" The S & P 500 is almost 27% higher in 2024, on pace for its second consecutive gain of more than 20%. In contrast, this year's rally in Chinese stocks could snap multiple years of declines. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is on track to break a four-year losing streak, posting a gain of more than 17% for the year so far. The Shanghai composite is up 14% year-to-date, after two straight years of losses. The MSCI China Index, which tracks stocks traded in both Hong Kong and the mainland, has held onto more than half of its gains since a surge of more than 35% fromthe lows in September to the October highs. Costello at Cambridge Associates pointed out in a 2025 outlook that a ""market collapse is unlikely."" ""Downside risks to China seem contained as monetary easing and actions taken to control local government debt risks should help to prevent further stress,"" Costello said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2024-12-15 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/15/china-gears-up-for-an-uncertain-2025-how-investors-plan-to-prepare.html,cnbc
"Electric car stock plays for 2025 as GM, Tesla struggle in China","If 2024 was the year that traditional foreign automakers were shown the exit on China's car market, 2025 looks to be the year that a few local electric car companies can solidify their leadership. ""In China, [new energy vehicle] leaders such as BYD are likely to consolidate their market position further, while foreign brands fade,"" Nomura said in a 2025 global autos outlook published Dec. 4. They pointed out how BYD has already taken 16% of the entire Chinese auto market as of October this year — up from 12% in 2023. That's according to year-to-date unit sales. The Hong Kong-traded automaker is Nomura's top pick for the China car market. The analysts rate BYD a buy, with a price target of 375 Hong Kong dollars ($48.20), for upside of just over 3% from Friday's close. BYD's revenue in the third quarter topped that of Tesla for the first time on a quarterly basis . The Chinese automaker in 2023 produced more cars than Elon Musk's automaker for a second-straight year . Tesla still made more battery-only cars than BYD, whose hybrid vehicles account for at least half of sales. But the U.S. electric car company sells in a far higher price range than most of BYD's models. Tesla's China sales fell by 4.3% in November from a year ago, while BYD saw a 67% surge, according to CNBC calculations of China Passenger Car Association Data. BYD is so far ahead of its competitors that the second-largest player by China market share, Geely , only has 8%, according to Nomura. HSBC analysts in late November raised their price target on Hong Kong-traded Geely Automobile to 19.30 HKD, nearly 31% higher than where the stock closed Friday. The firm rates the stock a buy. ""We believe that the company is on track to exceed its full-year target of 2m units, with EV penetration likely to reach 40%, supported by the strong performance of newly launched models,"" the HSBC analysts said. They expect Geely will grow sales by 22% next year to 2.6 million units. Geely owns U.S.-listed electric car company Zeekr and other auto brands, including Swedish brand Volvo, which the Chinese company acquired from Ford in 2010. Other traditional automakers, domestic and foreign, have struggled in China as the world's largest auto market has swiftly shifted to battery-only and hybrid-powered cars. General Motors in the last week announced it expects to incur billions of dollars in costs as it restructures its joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp. in China. The changes include plans to close plants. SAIC GM Wuling, a local GM joint venture, had 3% of China's auto market for the year as of October, according to Nomura. The company held 6% of the new energy vehicle segment, the data showed. Chinese electric car startups still only account for a fraction of the domestic market compared to top players BYD and Geely. One of Citi analysts' buy-rated plays is Hong Kong-listed Yongda , which operates stores for several new energy vehicle brands in China, including Huawei's Aito. While the Chinese smartphone and telecommunications giant has emphasized it does not make cars, Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers to sell battery-only and hybrid-powered vehicles that include its in-car entertainment system, driver-assist technology and other software. Citi analysts said that according to conversations with Yongda management on Dec. 4, cars running Huawei's automobile system can reach 1 million unit sales next year, above the 700,000 unit sales forecast internally. Yongda expects total Huawei-authorized stores to exceed 20 by early next year, up from 8 currently, according to Citi. The firm has a price target of 2.98 HKD on Yongda, up nearly 47% from Friday's close. Yongda also operates electric car stores for Xiaomi and Xpeng, according to Citi. Among the publicly traded Chinese electric car startups, Citi analysts have buy ratings on Nio and Leapmotor , but not Xpeng or Li Auto, both rated neutral. Citi said in a late November report that Hong Kong-listed Leapmotor is spending more efficiently on research and development than its peers, at around 7,400 yuan ($1,017) per car. In contrast, Xpeng spends 25,900 yuan, Nio spends 26,900 yuan and Li Auto spends 21,000 yuan, according to Citi. The analysts raised their price target on Leapmotor from 44.20 HKD to to 45.10 HKD, nearly 62% above Friday's close. Citi expects Nio's U.S.-traded shares can nearly double from current levels to $8.90. In a Dec. 3 meeting with Nio, Citi said the company is aiming to reach breakeven at a group level in 2026 partly by limiting research and development spending increases to less than 10% a year, and increasing car deliveries. The company aims to boost sales of its premium Nio brand by 10% to 20% next year, and accelerate sales of its recently launched lower-priced Onvo brand to 20,000 a month in March, the Citi report said. After two new SUVs launch in the second half of next year, the automaker expects Onvo monthly sales to reach 30,000 to 50,000 vehicles, Citi said.",2024-12-08 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/08/electric-car-stock-plays-for-2025-as-gm-tesla-struggle-in-china.html,cnbc
Fund managers at Fidelity share how they’re playing China’s stimulus plans,"For two fund managers at Fidelity International, Beijing's latest stimulus announcements were significant enough for them to buy more beaten-down real estate stocks. Chinese authorities have released a series of incremental measures since late September that range from cutting interest rates to extending financial support for finishing construction on apartments that have already been sold. ""This round of the policy pivot is quite significant in the sense that it is a well-coordinated [number of] supporting measures issued by different levels of government bodies,"" Theresa Zhou, a fund manager at Fidelity International, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. ""We have been moderately increasing our position in China,"" Zhou said. After the September policy announcements, she said the firm turned more positive on ""certain cyclical names"" in China real estate, after previously focusing on online platforms in the sector. If household confidence returns, that can pave the way for real estate prices to stabilize, especially in China's larger cities, she said. As of late 2023 and early this year, Zhou said she had been concerned about the housing downcycle given relatively high inventories and falling home prices. Zhou and Ben Li are co-managers of Fidelity's Greater China Fund . The firm does not disclose exact stock transactions. “We have been selectively increasing positions in quality companies in say the consumer and property sectors,"" Li said. ""In terms of consumer and property sector, we think they were hurt by the macro challenges in the last few years [and with the policy turning, some] may start to see incremental improvements."" ""We think experienced-based consumption will continue to do well,"" he said, noting the firm's investment in online travel agencies. One of the top 10 holdings of Fidelity's Greater China Fund is Chinese online booking platform Trip.com . In McKinsey senior partner Daniel Zipser's latest assessment of Chinese consumer sentiment , he pointed out that property transactions in October and the first half of November rose by 2%, the first increase this year. That's according to the firm's analysis of daily transaction data for 30 cities. ""It is fair to say that October has seen an uptick in consumption, creating positive momentum,"" Zipser said. While China has not handed out cash to the public, authorities have used targeted trade-in subsidies to spur purchases of home appliances and other big-ticket items. Companies, such as Alibaba , have noted a boost in sales. Those trade-in measures helped increase panel TV sales in China since the third quarter, Nomura analysts said in a Nov. 20 note. They estimate that, in a sign of growing demand, utilization of TV production lines at BOE and TCL Technology will likely increase in November from October. Nomura rates the two Chinese electronics companies, both listed in Shenzhen, as buy. The two Fidelity fund managers emphasized that their strategy focuses on selecting companies based on their individual competitive advantage. They added that it will take time to see the impact of stimulus, and said that they are watching upcoming government meetings in December and March for more policy details. China's top leaders typically gather in mid-December to discuss economic plans for the year ahead. Those measures and growth targets are then announced at a meeting of parliament in March. ""The positive change from that stimulus package is removing the tail risk and putting a floor [under] the market,"" Zhou said, noting she is ""cautiously optimistic."" Earnings comments in the last two weeks from major Chinese companies have underscored how it will take time to see the impact of stimulus . ""When we talk to companies on the ground after the earnings, it's positive that we do sense some improvement in their tone in terms of the enterprise confidence and also their expectation for the next year,"" Zhou said. In terms of geopolitical risk, she pointed out that Chinese companies have built out their overseas supply chain, making them better prepared today than they were several years ago for President-elect Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.",2024-11-24 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/24/how-fund-managers-at-fidelity-international-see-chinas-stimulus-plans.html,cnbc
Morgan Stanley picks China stocks to ride out a worst-case scenario in U.S. tensions,"After last month's excitement over stimulus plans, Chinese stocks now face mounting challenges as earnings have yet to pick up and heightened U.S. trade tensions loom. ""Stock picking remains important with [the] headwind of tariffs, a weaker currency and persistent deflation,"" Morgan Stanley chief China equity strategist Laura Wang and a team said in a report Thursday. For investment options, she referred to the firm's survey of China stocks the investment bank's analysts already cover. The firm screened for stocks that could outperform depending on which of three scenarios unfolded. Only the bear case accounted for significant U.S. tariffs and restrictions. The base and bull cases assumed the status quo in U.S.-China relations. The bear case also expects 1 trillion yuan, or $140 billion, in fiscal stimulus a year and MSCI China earnings per share growth of 3% this year and 5% next year. Morgan Stanley's basket of bear case stocks only includes overweight-rated names with a dividend yield above 4% this year. They also have free cash flow yield above 4% from 2023 to 2025 and market capitalization above $2 billion, among other factors. The companies must not be on Morgan Stanley's lists of stocks at a disadvantage from Republican policy and supply chain diversification. The only consumer name that made the list was Tingyi , a Hong Kong-listed company that owns instant noodles brand Master Kong. The company is also PepsiCo 's exclusive manufacturer and seller in China. Tingyi's net profit in beverages rose nearly 26% in the first half of 2024 compared to a year ago, while that of instant noodles rose 5.4%. Morgan Stanley expects Tingyi's earnings per share to grow 12% this year and 11% in 2025. Other Chinese companies that made Morgan Stanley's bear case basket included two state-owned energy stocks: drilling company China Oilfield Services and Cosco Shipping Energy Transportation , which specializes in shipping oil and natural gas. Both stocks are listed in Hong Kong, as is the only industrials name on the bear case list, Sinotruk . The truck manufacturer is also state owned. Morgan Stanley expects China Oilfield Services can grow earnings per share by 41% this year and 33% next year, while Cosco Shipping Energy Transportation can see its earnings rise 33% this year, before slowing to 16% growth next year. Sinotruk earnings can grow 18% this year and 17% next year, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. MSCI China constituents are on track for their 13th straight quarter of earnings misses, despite recent improvements in economic data, Morgan Stanley's Wang said. ""We expect further earnings downward revisions amid lingering deflationary pressure and geopolitical uncertainties until more policy clarity emerges."" Asia equity fund managers have modestly increased their exposure to China since September's stimulus announcements, Morningstar strategist Claire Liang said in a phone interview Friday. ""But many managers have said whether this rally can continue will depend on whether the policies can see real results,"" Liang said in Mandarin, which was translated by CNBC. Beyond stabilizing the economy, she said the managers are looking for whether corporate earnings can recover. China's October data release on Friday underscored a slow economic recovery despite the latest barrage of stimulus announcements. Industrial production missed forecasts. Fixed asset investment grew more slowly than forecast as the drop in real estate investment steepened, albeit with new home sales narrowing their decline. Only retail sales beat expectations with 4.8% growth . For China's export-heavy economy, the risk of U.S. tariffs has only risen over the past two weeks as the Republican Party has taken control of the U.S. Congress and President-elect Donald Trump has filled his cabinet with China hawks. Morgan Stanley's U.S. policy team expects Trump to impose tariffs soon after he takes office, and potentially hit Europe and Mexico along with China imports. While China is better positioned than six years ago to stave off the effects of targeted tariffs, the analysts said global duties on U.S. imports would hit China as much as targeted tariffs did in 2018.",2024-11-17 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/17/morgan-stanley-picks-china-stocks-to-ride-out-a-worst-case-scenario-in-us-tensions.html,cnbc
Three China stocks that analysts are watching for longer-term opportunities,"Chinese stocks wrapped up a momentous week marked by a $1.4 trillion debt swap program that fell short of many investors' calls for more direct government support. For many, the reaction among investors only reinforced the need to look at longer-term opportunities in individual stocks that haven't changed. The Ministry of Finance signaled at a closely watched press conference Friday that more fiscal support could come next year , while in the near term it focused on addressing local government debt. The relatively muted measures come as China gears up for heightened trade relations with the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose high tariffs on imported goods. Through it all, the CSI 300 stock index in Shanghair managed to rise nearly 6.6% last week, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rallied 3.2%. Stopping further weakness On a macroeconomic level, China is trying to ensure inflation and employment don't deteriorate further, said Liqian Ren, leader of quantitative investment at WisdomTree. While Ren doesn't expect a return to rapid growth, she is watching how Chinese companies are able to build up their brands and charge a premium, maturing from models that previously competed only on price. ""So I think consumer companies like Anta , I think not many people have understood outside China, but it is really becoming the world's leading sportswear company,"" Ren said. ""I think they are also going to make a global play soon. But not many Americans know about the brand."" But if Anta continues on its present path, perhaps in 10 years consumers will regard the company the same as ""Adidas or other so called foreign sports brands,"" Ren said. ""That's one thing that I am personally paying attention to."" Hong Kong-listed Anta sells sportswear under its own brand while owning Fila and high-end brand Descente, among others. The company said in October that Anta-brand retail sales for the third quarter rose by the mid-single digits from a year ago, while that of Fila weakened and other brands surged by as much as 50%. Anta shares are up 18% so far in 2024. China's efforts to rival foreign brands have not diminished, regardless of the slowdown. Baidu is reportedly scheduled Tuesday to release its own artificial intelligence-connected glasses, vying with Meta's RayBans product. Xpeng expansion Electric car startup Xpeng in the past week announced its own humanoid robot , and a new $26,000 car called the P7+ that's already racked up more than 30,000 preorders for deliveries due to start this month. The products are largely only going to be available in China, at least initially. ""For Chinese EVs, the door is now closed, and re-shoring is impractical,"" Macquarie analysts said in a Nov. 7 report. ""Our top pick is XPeng, a China pure play."" ""XPeng has no exposure to the U.S. market and no current plans to enter the market,"" the analysts said. ""Domestic volume has room to ramp quickly, led by new competitive models like the M03 and P7+. The successful launch of the M03 has helped to alleviate investor concerns about supply chain management and product competitiveness."" ""Upcoming catalysts, such as the pure-vision ADAS M03 and the launch of a hybrid system car could benefit from domestic confidence/consumption recovery and are unaffected by geopolitical events,"" the Macquarie analysts said. About half of Xpeng's 20,000-plus deliveries in each of the past two months have come from its lower-priced Mona M03 car. In the consumer sector, Macquarie's top pick is Yum China , which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China. ""YUMC is our top idea in the consumer sector given that it is a pure domestic market play,"" the analysts said. ""The company's strategy shift towards franchisee stores and new store format K COFFEE as well as Pizza Hut WoW would be a secular growth driver, which can decouple from geopolitical risk."" Yum China has ramped up shareholder return targets to $4.5 billion in 2026 from $3 billion in 2024, they added. Yum China on Nov. 4 reported third-quarter earnings, showing operating profit grew by 15% year-on-year to $371 million. Xpeng is due to release quarterly results on Nov. 19. In the week ahead, internet giants Tencent and Alibaba both report earnings. The central government is scheduled Friday Nov. 15 to release retail sales and industrial data for October. ""You have to be very willing to suffer the negative sentiment to invest in China,"" Ren said. There are often ""long stretch[es] of negative sentiment which really test a person's risk-taking."" But she also highlighted that Chinese stocks can serve as a hedge to other equity markets. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2024-11-10 00:00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/10/three-china-stocks-that-analysts-are-watching-for-longer-term-opportunities.html,cnbc
Stocks to play China's shopping festival — even if consumers spend less,"As China's biggest shopping festival of the year gets underway, analysts are starting to favor Chinese logistics companies as a way to play the online shopping trend. Their reasoning? The delivery companies are seeing package volume grow, regardless of how much consumers spend on each purchase. ""Express parcel volume growth has been outperforming online [gross merchandise value] growth since 2019, driven by the continued drop in ticket size amid a consumption downgrade,"" JPMorgan analysts said in an Oct. 30 report. The JPMorgan report initiated coverage of U.S.-listed ZTO Express , which the analysts said is China's largest express parcel player with more than 20% of the market. ZTO, also listed in Hong Kong, is more profitable than competitors YTO Express Group, STO Express Co., Yunda Holding Co. and J & T Global Express Ltd., the report said. JPMorgan has a price target of $30 on ZTO's U.S. shares, nearly 30% above where the stock closed Friday. ZTO YTD mountain ZTO Express shares in the U.S. in 2024. Alibaba and JD.com kicked off their annual Singles Day shopping promotions on Oct. 14 this year, more than a week earlier than in 2023. The festival, akin to Black Friday in the U.S., centers on Nov. 11. The e-commerce companies have stopped releasing Singles Day GMV figures in recent years as consumer spending in China has grown more restrained. At the same time, China's internet tech giants, once scrutinized for alleged monopolistic behavior, this year sought to lower the temperature by reducing competitive barriers and allow a rival's mobile payment system onto their platforms. China's online shopping landscape has created a large express delivery market in which logistics companies that use technology well can benefit from economies of scale, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report last month. The Morgan Stanley study ranked Chinese logistics players on an ""AI Matrix"" that tries to measure the willingness and ability to invest in artificial intelligence, along with the size and scale of the companies' proprietary data. Of three companies that stood out, ZTO also emerged as Morgan Stanley's top pick in China's logistics industry. ""We believe in a winner-takes-all express delivery market, ZTO will continue to benefit from its larger scale, more advanced infrastructure and devotion to tech innovation,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $27.50 on ZTO shares. Analysts also see opportunities for logistics players with Chinese ties to expand globally as PDD 's Temu and ByteDance's TikTok take on international markets. ""TikTok Shop's robust expansion in [Southeast Asia] should bolster J & T's dominance in the express delivery sector,"" Nomura analysts said in an Oct. 25 report, initiating coverage of Hong Kong-listed J & T Global Express . 1519-HK YTD mountain J & T Global Express Hong Kong-listed shares in 2024. The company was founded in Southeast Asia by Jet Li, who previously oversaw business in the region for Chinese smartphone company Oppo. Li is also executive director, CEO and chairman of J & T. J & T held a ""competitive 11% market share in China"" in the first half of this year — and the leading position in Southeast Asia with 27.4% of the market, the Nomura analysts said. ""Given sizeable parcel volumes from the China express delivery market, the profitability improvement in the China market could become a driver of J & T's net profit growth."" Nomura rates the stock a buy, with a price target of 7.30 Hong Kong dollars (94 cents). That's more than 16% above where shares closed Friday. Morgan Stanley is less bullish, rating J & T equal-weight while citing competitive risks in China and potential challenges in Southeast Asia. ""Cuts on overseas profitability outlook has weakened our investment thesis,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts said.

"How Apple's China suppliers could actually benefit from U.S. trade tensions, according to JPMorgan","After a sweeping look at global trade shifts, JPMorgan strategists have concluded that some of Apple's Chinese suppliers could benefit from the trend of supply chain diversification. The Oct. 18 report looked at 10 aspects of ""the great supply chain relocation and the rise of trading blocs."" The analysis ranged from China's dominance in the global supply chain and overcapacity concerns, to U.S. policy. U.S.-China tensions and talk of ""decoupling"" emerged during Donald Trump's first term as president. Calls for supply chain diversification picked up during the Covid-19 pandemic. Republican nominee Trump has threatened 60% tariffs on China if he is reelected as president next month. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is expected to maintain the Biden administration's tough stance on Chinese tech, and calls for high-end manufacturing to return to the U.S. ""Tariff war 2.0 would also likely accelerate the pace of global supply chain relocation,"" the JPMorgan analysts said. ""Our EM equity strategy team highlights some of the MSCI EM companies (from India, ASEAN and Mexico), which could be potential beneficiaries of supply chain relocation and growth of the manufacturing sector in the respective markets,"" the report said. ""Further, they highlight names that could benefit from Apple's supply chain relocation,"" the report said. Apple plans to increase production of iPhones in India , while some of its China suppliers have invested in factories overseas. The analysts' list of supply chain diversification beneficiaries included three names traded in mainland China: Wingtech Technology, Luxshare Precision Industry and GoerTek. JPMorgan rates Wingtech and Luxshare overweight, while its neutral on GoerTek. The three companies already manufacture in many parts of the world outside of China, according to their websites. Apple's latest supplier list show the company is buying from GoerTek and Luxshare in Vietnam as well as China. A supplier list from a prior year showed Apple bought from Wingtech's factories in Malaysia and the Philippines. The latest version only listed Wingtech's China operations. Other Chinese suppliers have expanded business abroad along with their customers. Shenzhen-based smartphone company Oppo said when it opened its factory in Indonesia, it helped around 10 of its suppliers move there as well. Chinese companies' overseas revenue has grown over the last few years, and a portfolio of companies with high overseas sales exposure has generated 9.5% annualized alpha from 2019 to 2023, Bernstein analysts said in their report this month on China's global manufacturing development. ""This, we believe, is going to be a key source of return for investors going forward as Chinese companies go global and leverage their low-cost, high-quality product strategy outside China,"" the analysts said. Apple supplier Luxshare is also one of their top picks. Bernstein rates the stock outperform with a price target of 50 yuan ($7.02), 15% above where shares closed Friday. Luxshare ""has a sizable site in Vietnam involved in the assembly of Apple wearables and non-Apple business. The overseas capacity represents ~25% of Luxshare's overall capacity,"" the Bernstein analysts said. For Apple's iPhone, however, the Bernstein analysts are less optimistic that India can become a viable alternative to China. They expect Luxshare to gain share in the smartphone's assembly in China.

Why governments are 'addicted' to debt | FT Film,"You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player

Government borrowing is the biggest issue in finance today.

Governments around the world are addicted to debt.

The sovereign debt levels globally have just grown exponentially.

In the case of the developed countries, the average ratio of public debt to GDP is now back to where it was in 1945. That's rather striking.

It's politically impossible to solve.

Exploding debt is a real worry. If you're an investor you start wondering what's going to happen and whether there's going to be a debt default.

The music stops when you get a major crisis.

The big question is, at what point does the bond market break?

We just don't want the bond yield to get up to a point where it crushes the economy, because then the bond vigilantes will have taken their vengeance.

A determined central bank can always override any market pressure.

I think bond investors should be terrified.

Let's face it, the world is addicted to debt. Pretty much every country, OK, leaving Germany aside, has very large amounts of government borrowing.

We've started to take it as so normal now that governments borrow enormous amounts of money relative to their GDP.

The US, Japan, Canada, Italy, France, all of these countries have very high debt levels by historical standards.

Wherever you look you see problems of government debt or deficit. The US, where the deficit is about 7 per cent of GDP. China also has a very large deficit.

It's a playbook that we've seen going back at least to the global financial crisis. You borrow your way out of trouble, and the way that you pay for that borrowing is more borrowing. And we don't seem to have a way out of this cycle at the moment, at least in some of the biggest economies in the world.

In the case of the developed countries, the average ratio of public debt to GDP is now back to where it was in 1945. That's rather striking. A great deal of this has to do with huge shocks.

So the global financial crisis. Then we had Covid. Then we had war in Europe. And each time governments have found, quite correctly, they need to be, as it were, the insurers of last resort.

Following Covid we had this global spike in inflation, interest rates going through the roof. That means much, much more expensive debt servicing costs, debt interest costs for government.

Debt to GDP levels are roughly 100 per cent, so the same amount of debt as these economies produce every year. The projections are they rise, rise and rise to the point where it gets a bit explosive.

My name is Olivier Blanchard. I've been a professor at MIT all my life, but I took a leave to go to the IMF. I joined in 2008. I had to deal with global financial crisis and then the euro crisis. There's a number of countries which are addicted to debt, and I think the disease can hit any country at any time.

I'm Ray Dalio. I'm the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world. I'm a global macro investor. When debts accumulate and interest payments accumulate, the debt service payments squeeze other spending. And it's a particular problem when there's a need to borrow money in order to make debt service payments. And the spiral begins.

Bonds are effectively an IOU. It's a way that the government can say to an investor, OK, you lend me this amount of money for this amount of time and I will give it back to you after that amount of time. And in the interim I will pay you interest payments called coupons.

Now, because there are loads of different bonds, they've all got different maturities, they've all got different coupons attached to them. It can be a little bit difficult to compare apples with apples. So to do that what we do is compare the yields that are available on bonds.

Yields go up when prices go down. What governments generally don't want is for yields to go up too quickly or too fast, because that jacks up borrowing costs for everybody around the country. That's why you need a good bedrock of support, of buying support for bonds.

One man's debts are another man's assets. So in order to hold the debt it has to be attractive. Then there is what some people call the debt death spiral, which means that there's selling of debt when there's worry about that.

People have been warning that this is getting out of control. That drumbeat is definitely getting louder now. We have seen the odd episode where it's looked like investors are saying, we're not buying any more of your bonds. That's when people start to get really jumpy.

I'm Karen Ward. I'm the chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. So my job is to advise clients on what's going on in and around the world and help them make the best investment decisions.

The level of government borrowing is certainly one of the top questions I get asked amongst clients today. Government debt is supposed to be our safe haven asset. It's supposed to be the bedrock of our portfolio. It's supposed to be the boring bit.

I'm Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income. From a bond investing standpoint, what I worry about is inflation, right? And so inflation on the rise is just so difficult from an overall portfolio standpoint to protect yourself.

Bonds hate inflation. It's like kryptonite for them. They just can't live with it because it eats into their returns.

In a world where we're also being met with inflation shocks, then the role of government bonds as that safe haven diversifier that many investors look to isn't quite so clear.

There are times when an increase in debt is completely justified, wars or preparing for wars, or Covid. These are cases where you have to spend more. What we have seen in many countries is not that. It's basically just tomorrow is another day type behaviour.

The world has been addicted to debt because debt has been for free. So we're coming out of this zero negative interest rate world where there's been nothing but encouraging taking on more debt.

I'm Stephanie Kelton, and I'm a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. I do a lot of public speaking - finance, hedge funds, investment bank. That's my crowd. I can poll them before I go in and say, how many people think we should be reducing budget deficits? Almost every hand goes up. How many people are worried about the national debt? Almost every hand goes up.

When I put this graph up everything changes. This is the United States of America. The government has been running deficits for virtually my entire life. But look up and they see surpluses in the rest of the world and surpluses in the US private sector.

If you want to eliminate the government deficit, you're going to erase all of the other surpluses because the one is creating the other. The government deficit is doing something very useful, which is creating a surplus, allowing the rest of us to net save. Their red ink is our black ink.

My name is Russell Napier, an adviser to investment institutions. One of my joys is also to be the keeper of the Library of Mistakes, a business and financial history library here in Edinburgh. There is an issue with there being too much borrowing in the government sector, but it has to be seen in conjunction with too much borrowing in the private sector. If we lived in a country where government debt to GDP was high, but private sector debt to GDP was low, then the consequences of this government debt addiction would actually be quite different.

Private borrowing and private debt, and private markets are, in my view, just as big a problem. Really big private busts cause explosion of government debt. After the financial crisis until the pandemic, and really a year or two after the pandemic, all we were worried about was inadequate demand and deflation. That was a world in which monetary policy was aggressively stimulative. Inflation has come back and inflationary pressures seem quite strong.

When you're dealing with governments' requirements and the political system, there's a desire for spending. When you get credit and you can hand things out on credit at that time it's better. Credit produces debt.

One of the ways we tried to deal with that situation for the last decade was to try and cut back on other areas of spending, but that's actually left us with a new problem. We haven't been committing enough to public services, public infrastructure. And you can see that the pressure is on governments around the west to, if you like, make up for the lost spending that happened during the decade of austerity.

You've got all these pressures which are building up. We've got quite weak growth. So you don't have hugely, rapidly growing tax revenues.

You're gambling with World War Three.

A more uncertain global security world. Defence is going to become more of a priority, not less. An ageing population. There's a green transition now. A lot of that needs some sort of public support to make it happen faster. And we're likely to see interest rates much higher than they were before. And that adds an additional burden.

We've now got to the point where it's pretty normal for governments to borrow on a kind of crisis pace every year.

In a world of low inflation you can get away with this. Bond investors will fund you and fund you and fund you. But in a world where it is not likely that inflation stays low, that is when time is called upon the whole thing. Supply and demand are running headlong into each other.

The bond market was the ultimate arbiter, right, of fiscal responsibility. The bond vigilantes, so to speak, step in and actually focus the mind of politicians.

I'm Ed Yardeni. I'm the president of Yardeni Research, focusing on global macroeconomic and financial markets. I've been doing this for over 45 years, and when I first wrote about the bond vigilantes in July of 1983. And during the 1970s bond investors got killed, inflation soared and bond yields went up dramatically.

And I argued that if the fiscal and monetary authorities were not going to maintain discipline that the bond vigilantes would take over, and they would push bond yields up to levels that could slow the economy down and bring inflation down. We just don't want the bond yield to get up to a point where it crushes the economy, because then the bond vigilantes really will have taken their vengeance.

We've seen all this rise in debt without the bond vigilantes stopping it, with a few exceptions. So what did we see in 2022 in the UK? The bond markets decided that the Liz Truss government didn't have a clue.

Our gift to the world is showing everyone what can go wrong if you push the bond market too far.

Mr Speaker, I am a fighter and not a quitter.

Bond investors talk about Liz Truss moments. We all remember back end of 2022, Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng effectively blew up the gilts market. Prices fell incredibly quickly, triggered a lot more very aggressive selling and it all got out of hand very quickly. And it took the Bank of England to steady the ship.

Governments around the world live in dread of doing that to their bond markets, because immediately you could see in the UK during that episode that borrowing costs went through the roof, people's mortgage costs went through the roof. Bond markets matter in real life because it really hits the average household in the pocket pretty hard.

The UK is front and centre in many respects around the concerns of debt sustainability.

So I don't think it's particularly a fiscal credibility problem here in the UK. There are questions over the long-term growth prospects here.

We don't want to get this out of proportion. There isn't a UK markets crisis happening right now like what we saw two or three years ago with Liz Truss.

This government inherited quite a relatively tight fiscal position. Maintaining fiscal tightness is going to be very difficult because the pressures for spending are just so strong.

The big question is when the big boy here, the US, which has the biggest deficit, has completely unsustainable debt profiles, when do the bond vigilantes take against the US?

The US is really at the heart of this entire issue. It's the lynchpin of the global economy, its bond market is worth more than $20tn. It has a bigger deficit than most western countries. And then you have Donald Trump coming into office.

Worst case, you're looking at 10 years forward, 160 per cent debt to GDP. That is an eye-popping staggering number.

The US federal government spent $880bn on debt interest last year. That's four times the level of a decade ago. And it's more than they spend on the military, almost as much as they spend on health. If the way that you pay for debt is to issue more debt, you're vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. And that's exactly what's happened.

It's approaching 25 per cent of all revenues just to pay back the debt. And that is the classic debt trap, right? It's a hole that you can't dig out of and you can't inflate your way out.

Well, the US is running an enormous deficit, about 6 per cent of GDP, which in peacetime at full employment, remember, is extraordinary. I mean, it's absolutely enormous. And the trajectory for US debt, if you look at standard forecasts, I mean, it's very, very disturbing since it's the most important country with the most important currency.

The projected amount of debt that has to be sold, which equals the deficit, is 7.5 per cent of GDP. And at existing interest rates that raises also debt service a lot. So it's right at that precipice.

I think the way that you address this issue is you make a bipartisan cross party lines commitment to 3 per cent of GDP.

People are so conditioned to hear the word deficit and think it's a pejorative. And what I think we have is a linguistic problem. We're using words like deficit and debt to describe things that are really quite benign.

When people say they're very worried about the government deficit, what they're saying is I'm very worried about the financial surplus that's in the non-government part of the economy. Call it the net contribution instead of the deficit. Call it the cumulative net contribution instead of the debt. The temperature would come down a lot if people understood that the thing we're fighting over is our financial surplus and our savings account.

The Trump administration, once they realised that they were going to go into the White House, they had to at least make some effort to satisfy the bond vigilantes. And so suddenly we have the DOGE department, the Department of Government Efficiency.

And they're also going to address the deficit. So we've got a $2tn deficit. And if we don't do something about this deficit the country's going bankrupt.

Maybe this Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk is supposed to head, will somehow find enormous savings, which will be enacted. I'm very, very sceptical that there's anything there which will be big enough to offset likely tax cuts.

Elon Musk was kind of... I think it was asked during the campaign, how much do you expect to cut off from the deficit? And he right away blurted out $2tn. Even he's backed off on that.

I'm sceptical that Musk will be able to reduce spending sufficiently to decrease the deficit by any substantial amount. It would take some hiccup in bond markets, in the Treasury market to actually lead Congress to be slightly more responsible.

The US is crucial to the global financial system. The dollar is the world's currency of trade, of cross-border debt. People in other countries, big investors, central banks, they need to hold dollars. That means they need to buy US government debt. It's the benchmark safe asset for the whole world.

Now, that has enabled the US government to be more free spending than most others. Maybe the type of crisis that we've seen in the UK or in the eurozone a decade and a half ago could eventually come to the bond market. The economy that is at the centre of all of this.

It could be really the most significant fiscal monetary problem in the world, and it could trigger destabilising events in financial markets.

I did see a post from President Trump, two words all caps, balanced budget with tax cuts and a lot of spending on border and other things. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see large deficits continue.

On the flip side, we've also seen, with a country like Japan, that you can have very, very high government debt levels for a very long time and really nothing bad happens. The key to Japan's success, if you like, is that their very high debt levels have been accompanied by economic stagnation, where the central bank keeps interest rates very low, and also does quantitative easing, where it buys up all of the debt. So it doesn't really enter the market.

And you have the currency depreciate by 4 per cent a year, so you lost about 70 per cent relative to US bonds. It's going to be a bad deal.

The bond vigilantes, if we want to be honest, they're the central bankers. A determined central bank can always override any market pressure to move yields higher, as the Bank of Japan has clearly demonstrated.

The unique thing about Japan is that the creditor of the Japanese government is the Japanese people. They've been prepared, it's mostly the corporate sector, to hold Japanese government debt at zero yields, despite inflation. And the Bank of Japan is a highly trusted institution. I wouldn't be surprised if there were problems at some point, but they do have the most trusting and most solvent creditors in the world, namely themselves.

For the most part this is a western problem. This is a problem in developed economies. But if you look at a country like China, for example, a lot of people now are drawing parallels between China's economy and Japan's 10, 20, 30 years ago, talking about demographics, ageing populations, debt levels going up.

You look at the debt levels in China. It's staggering. And I think that has real implications. It's a closed system. They're not growing in the same way that they have before. The remedies just aren't really available.

You could be seeing a situation there where these kind of existential worries about debt become, become an issue too.

The eurozone's public finances are rather stronger than those in the UK or the US or Japan. But the eurozone is not a cohesive picture by any stretch of the imagination.

Italy is one of the biggest borrowers, if not the biggest borrower, in the euro area. France, just politically, has a really difficult time reining in spending.

And in France there are plenty of issues that we have to confront, including the deficit and the debt. And so I'm involved in those discussions. The debt level is high, but it's increasing. And that's what worries me. I think we have to at least stabilise the ratio of debt to GDP. And that's a big number.

I mean, to do this under the best assumptions that I can make, it's 150bn that we have to find in the current political environment, that's absolutely impossible. It may well require the kind of crisis which makes people sit down and be willing to accept cuts. And without it, I'm not sure we'll get there.

You've got an additional element here, which is Germany, the poster child for limited spending, limited borrowing, one of the safest and frankly, most boring bond markets on Earth.

Germany's new chancellor has reached a historic deal to spend hundreds of billions of euros on defence and on infrastructure. Now, this is a huge change. We're talking about an economy that has historically been very reluctant to borrow heavily. So in a sense, Germany is belatedly joining the global debt party.

They need more domestic demand. And the private sector runs a huge surplus in Germany, doesn't generate demand adequately, has to spend a lot more on defence. We all know it. Its growth is very slow. It needs a lot more public sector investment. Investment has been very weak. If you need a defence build up, you need to borrow. That's what governments are for.

Whilst the rest of the world have been spending, whether that's cheques in the post in the US during Covid, huge support for industry like we've seen in China supporting its electric vehicles. We haven't seen the same behaviour in Germany, but it's paid the economic price for its prudence.

It's really struggling to compete with some of those car producers in China that, thanks to those subsidies, have reached massive economies of scale. The consumer in Germany, not having had those cheques in the post, is much more cautious, hasn't been spending.

The investment community has been crying out to Germany to borrow for the last decade and a half. They've been reluctant to do so. Now that they are, as I say, belatedly joining the party, people are assuming this will be great news for the German economy. Great news for the European economy.

Debt is not always bad. That's the important thing to remember here.

Italy is a bit different from France. It has a high level of debt, but again between 100 and 130, what you have is a prime minister who actually is fairly responsible from a fiscal viewpoint. One of the reasons is that a lot of money from Brussels is conditional on good behaviour. Italy is behaving fairly well.

The bond vigilantes have never been potentially more powerful simply because there's a lot more debt. Whether the politicians get the message is a whole other story.

We have to get the government deficits down to a level so the debt doesn't rise relative to incomes. If it's not done like that you will have a high risk of a financial market heart attack.

You just can't say at x per cent, that's when the bond market's going to wake up. That lack of clarity around an exact number is the problem.

That's the thing that really worries investors, because there's nothing they can do to hedge against it or prepare for it.

The big risk is what we saw in the 70s, the government said it issued debt in their own currency, very rarely default. With the Trump administration possibly at war with the Fed, that could look quite plausible in a year or two. And if that happens then the bond market would certainly break. You get high interest rates, high inflation, and in the end the inflation wipes out the debt. And that should make the investors very worried.

Something's got to give. Either bond investors have got to be convinced somehow to just chew down on returns that they really don't want, or governments have got to massively cut their spending.

Austerity isn't going to happen. It may be a market impulse to go for a debt spiral, but governments would not permit it.

These so-called vigilantes are backed because they can see a world going forward where there's more inflation. My opinion on the vigilantes is that they will be assassinated. Now, this is what we did after World War Two.

We didn't allow the market to determine the price at which the governments would pay for credit. We forced people to buy government bonds, keep those yields at rates that any vigilante would consider obscenely bad value, to prevent the debt spiral and a death spiral. Whether we live in democracies or whether we live in dictatorships, the dictation will be to the vigilantes, not the vigilantes dictating to the governments.

There's a real debate between economists. Some people will say the bill is falling due. Something bad is going to happen if we don't cut debt soon. Other people will point out that, actually, government finances are not like household finances. You don't have to pay your bills because you control the money printing machine.

The problem with that is that it's inflationary. So there's no zero cost way to sort this out.

If you don't like the fact that there's a large and growing Treasury market, you could always make the decision to stop issuing more Treasuries. It's a policy choice. It's not an economic imperative that the government issue securities to match the deficit each year.

You don't need to get rid of government debt. All you need is to stabilise it at some level that your population and your lenders think is reasonable.

Deficits can be useful. When the economy goes down, right, there is a recession, then it's clearly a good idea to have a larger deficit, a larger deficit when times are bad and a larger surplus when times are good.

Public finances have to be sustainable. The wrong way to get there is to have a massive, sudden fiscal shock and tightening. That was the great mistake after the financial crisis with austerity. But we should be sure that they're sustainable and that we should be sure that the public finances support growth.

If you simply take the view let's borrow as much as we can, then you'll find yourself with this problem in the private sector. Now, there are other people in that camp who say, well, that's really easy because we just fund it by printing more money. Well, there's a long, long, long, long, long history of how that is disastrous. Now, I know those people will argue that it will not be like that this time.

I think any financial historian finds it exceptionally difficult to see how the government, direct government financing by the central bank is anything but heading to very high levels of inflation. But, big but, there are plenty of savings in the world, and the government's going to manipulate those savings to borrow more money, but it's going to borrow that by forcing people to buy those government bonds.

I don't think they take the radical approach that some people recommend of direct funding of the government by the central bank. You don't have to take that risk. The world is full of savings. You can abuse the savers long before you have to abuse the balance sheet of the central bank.

I can't see a way for governments to snap this reliance on debt.

The countries which have large deficits are going to go through tough adjustments. The notion of fiscal rules will come back.

No panics. Panics are the worst thing you can do unless you've got an absolutely overwhelming immediate crisis.

Everybody wants more credit. And politicians particularly like borrowing and spending because the paying back comes in somebody else's term.

And if you can increase spending without increasing taxes and get away with it, that's nirvana. And there's only one problem is, well, how about the bond vigilantes? Maybe they don't want it, and maybe they have the power to stop that.

So there are big debt cycles that go on for 50 or 75 years, in which debt is rising relative to the income needed to service that debt. Policymakers need to understand the big debt cycle. Are there limits to debt? What are they like, mechanically? Yes, because it will come.

Every government deficit is good for someone. Is it a deficit that is resulting from passing tax cuts that primarily benefit people in the top of the income distribution? That deficit is going to be very good for that cohort of people. Or is it a deficit that is the result of making investments in your healthcare system, your education system, your infrastructure. That can increase the deficit as well and serve a different constituency.

Inflating away the debt by stealth over a period of many, many years may turn out to be the least worst option here, or at least one that allows politicians to avoid making some very, very unpopular decisions. But higher inflation, I mean, as we've seen in recent years, is very unpopular and can also lead to governments being thrown out of office.

Inflation has to be unexpected. If inflation is expected, then bond yields go up and actually governments don't improve their debt situation.

I can't imagine a world easily without government debt. Government debt has been a feature of economies for centuries. The modern financial system in the UK was created with the creation of the Bank of England, and that was there to help the government manage its debt. The government is the soundest credit and it does long run things. There's nothing wrong with borrowing. It's part of what makes a modern financial system work.",,https://www.ft.com/video/5d5c43ef-2a82-4b9b-8e94-eaf2559ab402,ft
Nvidia's rise in the age of AI | FT Film,"You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player

These are amazing times because we're at the beginning of a new industrial revolution.

This is the heart of US exceptionalism.

Nvidia has the Midas touch in Silicon Valley. Revenue growth year on year of 200 per cent or more.

The emergence of DeepSeek now putting pressure on the US tech names.

Some people have said that DeepSeek has shown that the US is behind on AI, and that China is creeping forward.

It turns out that you can possibly build a model which is almost as good as the very best in the business without having access to Nvidia's best chips, and made at a fraction of the cost.

Artificial intelligence has become so advanced it has now surpassed human performance on several basic tasks.

Over the past few years we've seen a real revolution in the artificial intelligence industry. A lot of companies and labs got set up to develop this technology, and they found that it was really important to scale what they were doing, to apply more computing power, to ingest more data, to come up with smarter algorithms to do that.

And what they found was that Nvidia's chips were fantastically flexible, and good at performing all of the functions that they really needed to build AI.

It's basically had a second life, which has surged it to one of the most important and valuable companies in the world. And they've become the hottest commodities in tech.

Let's talk about DeepSeek because it is mind-blowing, and it is shaking this entire industry to its core.

It turns out that you can possibly build a model, which is almost as good as the very best in the business, without having access to Nvidia's best chips, which don't make their way to China because of export controls. So DeepSeek seems to have done what it can with what it has, with quite remarkable results.

The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company which burst onto the scene. It was relatively unknown before, and it has these capable models, which are beating a lot of the rival companies or matching a lot of their capabilities.

What seems to have happened is that DeepSeek has found workarounds. They've taken shortcuts. It's found new ways to train the algorithms to get them to a similar level as OpenAI.

Now, we don't fully know exactly where DeepSeek's technology came from. That's going to emerge over the coming weeks and months, if at all.

The sort of frightening thing for the US competitors is that if the export controls were effective, it's almost like what's happened is that DeepSeek has found a way to make apple pie without using apples.

After DeepSeek came out with their reasoning model the US stock market clearly freaked out, and $1tn was wiped off the value of the leading US tech firms in one day. The phrase of our time seems to be 'the Sputnik moment'.

Originally, when the Soviets put up the first satellite in 1957 the Americans panicked and thought that they were getting a technological edge over them, and therefore invested massively. Some people have been talking about DeepSeek and the development of its reasoning model as another Sputnik moment for America.

AI is a tool, it's entertaining, it does things for businesses, but it's also a weapon. And it's really important to remember that when you're thinking of the response to all of this from DC. Lots of AI companies, including OpenAI and Meta Platforms are questing towards this thing called artificial general intelligence, which is the point at which AI becomes as intelligent as a real human being.

This is kind of the holy grail, and whoever gets there first, whichever country gets there first, is going to have a formidable advantage over its trade partners and rivals.

The British mathematician IJ Good, who worked at Bletchley Park and was one of the pioneers of computing technology, came up with this idea of humankind's last invention, by which he meant an ultra-intelligent machine that would be able to invent everything that we could invent. So we reach a certain point of development where we effectively hand over the baton to an electronic intelligence, that then can invent everything that we would have been capable of inventing ourselves only in faster and more capable ways.

Now, this has been a somewhat theoretical discussion and remains a theoretical discussion, but that really is where people are hoping to get with AGI.

In this race between the US and China to attain hegemony in AI, the US has been looking to kind of hamstring the Chinese. They don't think it's very sensible for them to export their state-of-the-art chips to enable the Chinese to develop very powerful AI systems.

Our export controls, not backed by tariffs, are like a whack-a-mole model, where they get prevented over here and China figures out a way around it over there. We've got to find a way to back our export controls with tariff model, so that we tell China, you are... you think we are your most important trading partner. When we say no, the answer is no. It's a respect thing.

First, Donald Trump and then Joe Biden have imposed quite strict export restrictions, both on the chips themselves and the equipment that is used to manufacture those chips. And this has undoubtedly had a big impact on the development of the Chinese chip sector and the AI industry as well. But perversely, that restraint has in fact acted as a great spur to innovation within China.

Some people have said that DeepSeek has shown that the US is behind on AI, and that China is creeping forward. I don't think China has ever been behind on AI. It's something that, that country has been working on for a very long time. It has a huge amount of AI resources and talent, and it's got to be seen as a credible competitor to the US.

There was a whole narrative that the only way you could play in AI was to invest massive amounts of money in computing and data and very smart researchers. And we saw recently the Stargate announcement where Donald Trump was standing next to Larry Ellison from Oracle, and Sam Altman from OpenAI, and Masayoshi Son from SoftBank, who had committed to invest as much as $500bn, although the initial tranche was only for $100bn, in developing these massive data centres that were going to be the infrastructure for this latest AI revolution.

But that really only added to the extraordinary impact that DeepSeek had later that week, when it became apparent that other people were experimenting with different AI methodologies on a far cheaper way, and with far less compute power, and coming up with extremely powerful models.

We also don't yet know how DeepSeek will progress. Will its models get much better? Is this as good as it gets? Will we find out new information about the way it was produced that changes the story somewhat? We don't yet know.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which it says are in insane demand, may not be the only way to get to a really high standard of AI. So it wouldn't be surprising if Nvidia's valuation takes a knock and doesn't entirely come back.

But do we need Nvidia? Absolutely, yes.

Are its chips the best in the business? Undeniably so.

They also make the software which allows you to control and organise the server farms. So Nvidia really does have a bit of a chokehold or a stranglehold on the industry at the moment.

There's a lot of money to be made in the video game business. Last year $5.5bn worth.

The two biggest video game makers are soon going to bring a new game to town, one that runs on compact discs.

The earliest insight that Nvidia's founders had was that computer graphics were going to be a big thing. That was something that deserved its own processor. And this was a time when Intel ruled the world, partnership with Microsoft on Windows. Wintel was the dominant computing platform and would continue to be for decades.

Video games at that time, in the early 90s, were starting to become a big thing. Nintendo and Sega had all started but these were not very graphically rich things.

So the insight was that this is something that you can build a dedicated chip for, because they were catering to an audience of video gamers who just wanted ever faster chips for ever better graphics and increasingly frenetic multiplayer battle. Those games gave Nvidia a reason to exist, and to keep existing, and set up the customer base for a type of chip that otherwise might have just been absorbed into the standard Intel CPU.

The early history of Nvidia is not one of immediate success. It's one of struggle and sacrifice. And Jensen really, I think, has retained that philosophy, that there is this kind of Hobbesian world you're operating in.

To this day, I use the word... the phrase 'pain and suffering' inside our company with great glee. And the reason... and I mean that.

You know, boy, this is going to cause a lot of pain and suffering. And I mean that in a happy way.

Because you want to train, you want to refine the character of your company. You want... you want greatness out of them. And greatness is not intelligence, as you know. Greatness comes from character, and character isn't formed out of smart people. It's formed out of people who suffered.

Jensen's a very interesting character. He moved to the US from Taiwan when he was nine. He went to Oregon State University, and then he went on to Stanford, where he studied engineering. Because of his engineering background he clearly has a deep understanding of the product itself.

Our brand new GeForce RTX 50 Series Blackwell architecture, the GPU is just a beast.

I think a big part of what makes Jensen interesting in Silicon Valley today is he is the last of the pre-dotcom generation of founder CEOs. He is out there living the rock star life, appearing on stage with everybody that he can think of, even some of his biggest competitors and companies that want to be his biggest competitors, like Masa Son from SoftBank or Satya Nadella at Microsoft. He's up there on stage, shaking hands and joking.

It was just bizarre when it was happening, just how quickly this company was transformed into being one of the superstars. And Jensen Huang, the CEO as well, became one of the most globally recognisable people in business and finance.

This is not a company with a very traditional hierarchy. Nvidia frankly sounds quite chaotic to work for, because Jensen can walk past any engineer's desk and will know exactly what they're working on, will know enough about what they're working on to make some pretty detailed questions about it.

He has this ability to reach down into the organisation and does not want to do meetings, does not want to do appraisals, does not want to share information with his top lieutenants. He wants everyone to know what everyone is working on. So his management style is very, very different to most American businesses.

Maybe there's a slight sort of chaos element in a lot of startups, but normally by the time you get to a $3tn valuation, things have calmed down a little bit. Not so much at Nvidia.

I never finished my business plan.

I know it. I know it. We never finished a business plan, never could figure out how to finish a business plan, to tell you the truth.

Nvidia kind of accidentally stumbled into AI. Its chips were made for rendering video games graphics, and it was by accident that they were discovered to be hugely powerful and useful for designing AI systems.

Over a decade ago, researchers basically figured out that if you use these GPUs and try to deploy AI models onto them that they could scale. And that was really an advancement for the theory of neural networks, which is what underlies a lot of the AI that we have today. It's a system where AI kind of operates like the human brain.

The real question around Nvidia is what's happened in two years that's taken it from a roughly $300bn company to a $3tn company, that's potentially one of the most valuable in the world, it's vying with Apple and Microsoft for the top spot.

Hundreds of percent multiples increase in just a short space just by the surge in its market capitalisation and share price, the demand for its products. There really isn't anything better than what Nvidia are offering in terms of GPUs for this at the moment.

What we are now seeing, though, is an attempt from everybody, not just the big rivals like Google and Meta and Amazon, to reduce this reliance on Nvidia, to make their own chips, to design their own servers, bring in their own software.

One, because they want a bigger share of the pie for themselves, but also they want, as a secondary measure, they want control of their own destinies. They do not want to have to go cap in hand to Nvidia when they need more chips. They don't want somebody else in control of which of their rivals gets the most chips.

You're also seeing companies like AMD, who are trying to make their own rival chips, which can be cheaper and more cost effective. And you have this supply and demand problem where Nvidia is struggling to meet all of the demand for its chips. So if another company can come in, offer similar capabilities at a better price, then companies might decide to go with them.

I'm an economist. I have great confidence in the market system. It gets some things wrong, it gets some things right, but the competitive process is a very healthy one for economic growth. But that competition becomes quite strained when one or two companies dominate everything. And we've become accustomed to that in the information age. And Nvidia is perhaps pushing that to the next level.

We have plenty of examples from history where innovations in some domain create scarcities in others. The British Industrial Revolution's early phase was characterised by tremendous advances in spinning, which suddenly made weaving very scarce. So it led to a huge increase in weaver wages. But then what happened is that the power looms came, and weaver wages fell by almost half.

New, creative destruction can actually change the dynamics at one fell swoop. And one might think this is not out of the question for Nvidia. Somebody else may come up with a chip that is far superior, and then that could change dynamics completely.

In the aftermath of the markets being impacted by DeepSeek, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, referenced something called Jevons paradox, and that was essentially the theory that coal consumption in the Industrial Revolution, despite increases in energy efficiencies, didn't decrease. The demand for it only increased, and that's because people were consuming more and more energy than ever.

And so the counter point for Nvidia that it's hopeful for is that people will continue to need chips for AI, whether that's for training or actually whether it's for something called inference, which is running the models. As consumers start to use AI more and more, the argument is we will need the infrastructure there to be able to meet demand for these products.

The atmosphere out here on the West Coast is feverish. People that have been out here for years say it reminds them of the dotcom boom or the real take-off of consumer mobile phones. There is huge optimism about both the potential of AI to transform business and, as always, the potential for AI to make a lot of people a lot of money.

It's really been kind of the shot in the arm that San Francisco as a city and the wider Bay Area, including Palo Alto, kind of needed after a few dire years, some difficult years during the pandemic. Suddenly, they had this new technology that was going to touch every part of business and human society to kind of organise around and to compete with. It's really injected a sense of optimism, urgency, but increased competition.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence has been around a long time, decades. And it's gone through a number of, what they called AI winters, where people would get very excited, and they'd do a lot of stuff, and then they would realise that it just wasn't viable.

And Nvidia, they certainly recognised the opportunity when it presented itself. And they went whole hog into this in developing not just the hardware, but the software and the ecosystem they'd already started to build around graphics processing for games, consoles, to build it around artificial intelligence, when it became very clear that the math that was used for both and the types of calculations that were used for both were very, very similar.

So they reached out with both hands and kind of grabbed this opportunity. And they've been building parts for this for many, many years. Now, it's only recently that we finally hit the inflexion point.

Nvidia's chips are being used by OpenAI, who have a long history of using these GPUs and developing AI systems. And they were building these large language models which had really AI at scale that could speak in a conversational way. And that's what then became the chatbot that we know as ChatGPT, which in 2022 just exploded into public consciousness where people for the first time could really interact with AI systems, and see how advanced they had got, where they could talk to the system, and it would respond in a way that was like talking to a human.

When you look at the insane growth of Nvidia, that has a sort of rising tide effect. So there is a whole ecosystem of companies whose fortunes have somewhat been tied to and also been sort of feeding Nvidia's success. There are certain companies which Nvidia has developed partnerships with over the years, some of these more hybrid cloud companies who use Nvidia's chips, and then sort of rent out the capacity system of using an Nvidia chip.

Suddenly, they realised they were sat on this lucrative stack of hardware that could be sold or rented out for much more money to people suffering from a lack of capacity in the AI industry. So they were like, we can benefit from this.

So they've pivoted their companies, and people like Lambda and Cohere have been raising billions in financing, they're raising debt from some of the largest Wall Street banks, and they're even raising money from Nvidia, It's kind of a circular financing arrangement. Nvidia is providing them financing to buy some of their... more of their chips.

We have a really close relationship with Nvidia. We're a critical vendor for them because we not only just sell GPUs, but we offer services that make their GPUs more accessible, whether it's just really good support or access to GPUs via our cloud. Nvidia views this us like a key partner because we make their product more accessible. In turn, they are willing to give us allocation.

So we're building a cloud for AI. Our job is to make it easy for people who are doing AI research to do their research. A lot of that focus is on infrastructure.

So AI research requires a lot of computation to do well. And what used to be kind of like the purview of national labs, where you'd build these giant supercomputers, is now something that's been brought into AI, and running that infrastructure is enormously challenging.

Lambda is a case of a company that's managed to raise millions of dollars in loans using the chips as collateral. And also has seen very, very speedy funding rounds and succeeding each other very fast and sort of off-scale growth over the last year or two.

It's very hard to predict whether something is a bubble, but certainly there is a huge amount of interest in AI at the moment. And it's not clear when that interest is going to stop. It's also not clear when these companies are going to start making money.

There was a particular note from a Goldman Sachs' head of research, which attracted a lot of attention, basically identifying a single-digit billions revenue opportunity versus hundreds of billions being invested per year.

Microsoft, Meta, Google, they are spending collectively every six months, more than $100bn, largely on buying data centres, filling them with chips and networking equipment and servers, to kind of feed this insatiable demand for AI-related computing power.

This has been compared to the next industrial revolution. And certainly you're hearing lots of tech chief executives talk about AI in comparison to lots of theories of the industrial revolution, as well. And it's certainly a disruptive technology. There's lots of talk about the types of sectors this is going to impact, and the displacement of jobs, which might be automated out of the workplace by this technology.

A lot of people out in Silicon Valley telling me that this is very similar to the dotcom bubble and boom, and that this technology is going to be just as influential as the internet, if not more. And I think we're kind of at the stage now where we have the concept, and we have the technology, and the capabilities, but we don't have that sticky app yet. We don't have that use case or use cases that are really changing the world.

The bear case for this is that the corporate uses and the consumer uses that people willing to pay for chatbots are simply not as great or persuasive or as well-developed as people think and hope they are at the moment. We're not going to see every call centre replaced with just a super smart AI chatbots that can do the job more effectively, much faster and crucially for companies, much cheaper.

What we need to see, I think, to justify some of the valuations of the companies and the money going in is some real-world use cases, real-world revenue being generated that will kind of calm people down a bit. And if that doesn't start to come through I would say then it's going to start to be a bit concerning. And a lot of companies are going to have to make really tough decisions on their spending and job cuts.

Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.

I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.

That I will faithfully execute...

Trump's a bit of a wild card in two directions for Nvidia. Trump has talked about Taiwan as stealing the US semiconductor industry.

They took our business away. We should have stopped them. We should have taxed them. We should have tarifffed them.

Nvidia doesn't operate in a vacuum. I think that's really important to be aware of. They don't actually make the chips themselves. They design the chips. They send the designs to, what's called, a fab. It's just like a manufacturer.

North of like 90 per cent of the most powerful chips in the world are produced by one company, TSMC. It's a huge geopolitical question for the future about the need to retain access to that chip supply, because it's possibly the biggest vulnerability for Nvidia is you're making billions and billions of dollars off chips, which you design in the US. But then to actually bring them to customers, you need to ship them from Taiwan.

If TSMC's operations are disrupted by an earthquake, which, you know, happened quite recently, and things were fine, but might not be next time, or by some kind of incursion by China, whether that's a blockade, or something, you know, slightly hotter than that, this is something that would grind the AI revolution to a halt very, very quickly.

These are becoming geopolitical issues. This is an incredibly geopolitically sensitive area of the world. It's kind of like China's Ukraine, if you're looking at it from a kind of the Russia angle. A lot of people are very concerned about what happens.

The US is in the process of engaging in this kind of historic investment by the US federal government in building US chip manufacturing capacity. So the success of that project will be really critical for Nvidia in the long term.

And just yesterday Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount - 97 per cent of the market - announced a $165bn investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA.

And we're not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money, and they don't spend it.

The Industrial Revolution was the beginning of a very painful process. It wasn't all smooth sailing. It's not like, oh, yeah, the Industrial Revolution came, machines started helping workers and consumers, and everybody suddenly became much wealthier. It took many new technologies, many new companies, a redirection of the overall scientific and industrial effort of the entrepreneurial and the scientific class in Britain and elsewhere.

So if Jensen Huang is anticipating all of these institutional and technological changes, I think he may be right. But it also means that we're going to have a very long and very hard several decades ahead of us.

There's a question for the government about how it wants to play this, and how AI companies in the US are really going to compete with the power that Chinese AI has.

We've already seen these export controls on Nvidia's shipments into China, and they have to ship versions of their chips for China which are pretty hobbled compared to the types of equipment that you can deploy in the US.

And yet, DeepSeek claimed that they managed to develop this technology on H800s, which are more inferior chips and permitted under these export controls. So they didn't do anything nefarious, but were still able to generate systems with similar capabilities to their competitors in the US. And that's created concerns that perhaps the export controls aren't working, maybe they need to be weakened because they're redundant, or maybe they need to be tightened, and we need to prevent more spread of these highly powerful chips going to China.

There's no doubt that both US and Chinese companies are pawns in a big geopolitical game at the moment. Your classic economist would say that there would be far faster development of the industry as a whole if there was free trade between the US and China, and both were able to concentrate on their fields of expertise, and there was a free exchange of views and methodologies between the two sides. But we're not seeing that. And in fact, it's quite the reverse.

We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labour. And that's exactly what we're doing.

We're seeing a separation between a blue supply chain and a red supply chain. And so this very integrated industry that we had seen develop in the postwar era has now been pulling apart. And you are seeing US and China developing their industries very separately.",,https://www.ft.com/video/1993553a-6855-47f4-8c2f-6a5d4d5f0507,ft

'Film me!’: Russia's executions of Ukrainian POWs point to a policy | FT Film,"You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player

Captured Ukrainian soldiers, forced to kneel, then shot in the back.

Through the fog of Russia's war on Ukraine this type of crime has become more and more visible - the execution of prisoners of war.

Ukrainian prosecutors now believe Russia is executing POWs as part of a deliberate and systematic policy. We are going to try to find out what can be done to document these war crimes, and to achieve a sense of justice.

And we're going to show you what we found when we tried to uncover the identity of this hooded executioner.

It's not a movie.

It's human beings which have been killed.

Every military person knows that you shouldn't rely on international humanitarian law.

They normalise evil.

We must break the circle of impunity to prevent the Russian attack to the next nation.

Toward the end of 2023, I began noticing more cases in which Russian soldiers were executing surrendering Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. In recent months, and toward the end of 2024, we noticed a big spike.

This specific type of crime, which is related to the execution of our prisoners of war, is definitely, I could say at the moment, it's a priority number one. Almost 90 per cent of all executions happened last year.

So many of these videos that we see filmed by mostly Ukrainian surveillance drones over the battlefield show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a foxhole or a trench, unarmed, with their hands in the air or behind their head. And they're clearly in the video seen surrendering.

But taking into account that Russians don't notify us how many prisoners of war they have. That's why we really don't know how many, out of these missing guys, how many of them have been as well executed.

The only mechanism how a soldier on the battlefield, a Ukrainian soldier or any other soldier, can rely is international humanitarian law - Third Geneva Convention, for example, for the treatment of prisoners of war.

So international humanitarian law is very clear when it comes to executions. When somebody is sick, wounded on the ground, or has surrendered, from there on it's strictly prohibited to execute such a person.

In some cases, we've seen video footage, filmed by Russian soldiers themselves, first interrogating surrendering Ukrainian soldiers, but also humiliating them before then shooting them at point blank range.

The rules of war have been flouted in many other brutal conflicts around the world. But this is possibly the first time that drones and phones have been able to capture so much of the evidence over the battlefield, especially when it comes to the execution of POWs.

It's definitely part of the policy. It's a system which we see, and it's not about the just accountability of specific soldier, or commander, of a lower level. We see that president of the Russian Federation and all leaders of militaries, they also would be responsible for this crime.

This is a Oleg Yakovlev. He's a 32-year-old Russian soldier, a father of two daughters. He likes rapping...

...and drugs.

His badges say he's from the Storm Unit of Russia's 30th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. Storm units are made up of convicted criminals...

...released early for agreeing to fight. And we know that Oleg has had several run-ins with the law, including a four-year sentence in 2018 for manufacturing cannabis oil, and a conviction for theft in 2022.

His YouTube videos are a snapshot of a soldier's life, at war and at home. He even shows us where he lives - Saratov, a port city on the Volga River, 900km southeast of Moscow.

And then, on January 22 this year he posted this - a three and a half minute video showing the execution of six Ukrainian servicemen. The Ukrainians are easily identified by their yellow armbands.

A hooded man is directing events. He appears to have handed over a phone, and is demanding to be filmed. He makes sure a drone above them has left and then orders two Ukrainian POWs into the open.

The Russians shoot the two Ukrainians in the back.

Even as the next victim is shot, one of the Russian soldiers pleads to have a turn.

We believe there are grounds to investigate further whether Oleg is the hooded executioner. The other Russian soldiers addressed the man by a call sign, Sara. That could be a short form for Oleg's hometown, which we know is Saratov. It's also how Oleg introduces himself in his rap.

And the name soldiers call out in Oleg's other YouTube videos.

Sara. Sara.

And it's the hooded man who repeatedly asks to be filmed, in a video that then appeared for the first time on Oleg's YouTube channel.

We asked a team of forensic audio experts to compare Oleg's voice from his social videos to the voice in the execution video.

They carried out a full audio spectral analysis. Due to how social media compresses video files, definitive answers are difficult. But the team concluded that the frequency fingerprints did display strong elements of similarity. When the fifth victim is marched into the open, it's the hooded man we see opening fire.

By the end of the video, the Russians have shot down six Ukrainians. It took less than 80 seconds.

When the video cuts out, one Ukrainian is left.

We'll come back to Oleg later in the film. I'll show how he responded when I got the chance to question him about the execution.

I am deeply concerned by a significant increase in credible allegations of executions of Ukrainian military personnel captured by Russian armed forces. Summary executions constitute a war crime.

Between the full-scale invasion in February 2022 and the end of 2024 Ukrainian prosecutors opened pre-trial investigations into 59 separate execution cases. These cases involved the suspected killings of more than 201 Ukrainian prisoners of war. In 2024, there were 43 separate cases involving 133 suspected executions. The FT identified and mapped 30 of those cases, involving at least 109 victims. In more than half of those incidents we were able to view video evidence, and prosecutors confirmed to us that they believed all those incidents were credible.

It was not always possible to pinpoint the exact date and location. But what's clear is that cases were recorded all along the front line, with a big increase later in the year. Prosecutors say this means it's not just one or two rogue units that are responsible, and indicates that execution is a Russian policy.

But fully verifying exactly what happened, when, where, to whom, and by whom is complex. Army units do not always report suspected cases, and sometimes prosecutors are only made aware of cases when videos are published on social media. For its part, the UN has recorded 24 credible incidents since the end of August last year, involving 79 executions. The Centre for Information Resilience has also been tracking and investigating cases.

We assess credibility based primarily through visual investigations - so visual verification, chronolocation, geolocation. When we're looking at these kind of incidents, a way in which we can tell the difference between Ukrainian and Russian soldiers is that Russians will have darker uniforms. These will tend to be more of a green uniform. Whereas Ukrainians will have a lighter uniform, more towards a grey or kind of sandish colour.

We'll look for something called IFF, the identification friendly foe. So these are bands worn on the sleeves, sometimes on the thighs, sometimes on the armour or the helmet. Ukrainians will use things like green, yellow, and blue IFF, whereas Russians use red and white. And this is a pretty key indicator.

So in this video, in Zaporizhzhia in February, we can see three men who we've identified as likely to be Ukrainian servicemen. We know this because they're in lighter uniforms. They appear to be unarmed. They appear, perhaps, not to have their helmets on, and likely to have their armoured chest rigs on.

We also have three men who are in darker coloured uniform. One has a white armband on, which is consistent with the Russian military identification friend or foe band. Two men appear to be instructed to leave the trench. They're brought out above the trench, and they're shot by one of the men in dark uniforms.

After these two men are shot, the dark uniform Russian serviceman walks over to the third and shoots him. We can identify that he was alive prior to this incident as he was moving around a little bit. When he's actually shot, his body jerks.

It is quite clear to us that this is a pretty cut and dry execution. These men were unarmed. They're very likely to be Ukrainian, and they were shot by men who are very likely to be Russian servicemen.

In this video, we can see at least five, maybe six Ukrainian soldiers who are lying on the floor. The man at the top of the screen appears to be in a sort of darker green uniform, consistent with the Russian military. Several of the individuals we identify as Ukrainian are already dead. We can see this because there's blood, there's lack of movement.

And two were shot point blank. We can see them moving prior to the incident. We know that they were alive. We also know that they were unarmed, as well.

So right at the end of the video the man who was talked to by the Russian soldiers is then undressed. He's led away, and the video cuts out. We're not entirely sure what happens to him. Perhaps he's questioned. Perhaps he's also executed, the same as the other five men in the video.

Investigators are also looking at cases of beheadings, and a soldier with his hands tied who was stabbed with a sword. Sometimes the Russians film and post the videos themselves. In this case, a mock execution of a prisoner of war.

Mock execution is a war crime, but the Russian soldier is happy to show his face to the camera.

Accountability for all of these killings is essential, and instead, there is almost total impunity.

Perhaps the most well known execution video surfaced about a year after the start of the full-scale invasion.

And it showed a soldier named Oleksandr Matsievsky, and he's speaking to somebody behind the camera. And that person is a Russian soldier who's filming him. He asked him if he has any last words, anything to say. And Matsievsky very calmly puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it. And then he says 'Slava Ukraini', meaning 'Glory to Ukraine'.

There could be many reasons for Russia implementing a policy of executing Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, rather than taking them prisoner.

First of all, I think it's a kind of frustration from Russian forces. Putin gave them so many orders to capture Donetsk region, Luhansk region, but they still can't do it.

Their own lives are worth nothing for their commanders. So maybe that's why they can't pay attention to lives and health of Ukrainian soldiers, too.

I think we have to go back to the beginning of this invasion and recall that Vladimir Putin set out very specific goals in mind. One is to demilitarise this country. So executing male soldiers, you're getting rid of a combatant on the battlefield.

This is their war habit. On the front line, when you have some hostilities with Russians, you can't rely on any humanity.

The execution video featuring the hooded man was shared widely after Ukrainian war journalist Yuriy Butusov posted it on Telegram. We found what we think is the original video post from a day earlier on Oleg's YouTube channel. Dating and locating the video is difficult, but the lack of foliage on the trees and the thick clothing worn by some of the soldiers suggests autumn or later. In autumn Oleg's brigade was stationed near the frontline hotspot of Pokrovsk. Russian soldiers were advancing amid fierce fighting, and reportedly suffering huge losses.

I contacted Oleg on Russian networking site VKontakte, and spoke to him via messages. He appeared to acknowledge it was his YouTube channel where the video was posted. But when I asked him if he had executed any Ukrainian soldiers, he said no. He also said he didn't know anything about the men in the video.

And in a bizarre rant, he said he wasn't a soldier but an invalid, an old man, a car mechanic. Then he warned me off investigating further. At one point, he did at least offer a comment on the execution video. 'The boy killed those guys for a reason,' he said. 'Russian soldiers don't kill people for no reason.'

As we were speaking, all his YouTube videos were taken offline. In July, President Putin awarded Oleg's brigade for bravery and heroism during combat. But in one of his video posts Oleg says most Russian soldiers only sign up to fight for the money, and are soon longing to come home

Military analysts like Deep State map and track developments on the battlefield. They even have a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry. Sometimes soldiers don't want to go through official channels, so they might send execution videos to Deep State to analyse and publicise instead. The founders invited us into their office in Kyiv. In the corridor, shelves full of mementos from the battlefield.

The souvenirs underline how Deep State is not just reliant on OSINT, or Open Source Intelligence, like videos and photos published online. They also have extensive first-hand contacts with the military.

A soldier posted this drone footage on Telegram.

The UN later verified 10 deaths, and you can count 10 men before they're gunned down in the footage. Ukrainian prosecutors noted another six to eight thermal silhouettes resembling human bodies near the execution site. And Deep State says it trusts a death toll of 16, based on information from a first-hand observation. But in many cases evidence is often partial or non-existent.

In international law it's not just those who pulled the trigger who were guilty, but also those who give the orders or fail to prevent these crimes.

Ukraine's Defence Intelligence services say the man speaking in this intercept is a Russian brigade commander.

There are also orders from higher up the chain, like a statement from the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, in October.

Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. In December, he appeared at his press conference with the flag of the country's 155th Naval Infantry Brigade. The brigade had been fighting in Kursk, where Ukraine made incursions into Russian territory. But it's also been accused of multiple war crimes, including beheadings, and in October, the execution of nine drone operators.

Suspected Russian war criminals have even received star treatment back home. The two men featured in these publicity videos were selected by Putin's Time of Heroes Elite Management School. But months earlier Ukrainian intelligence said they had been identified over a very different video, naming them among five Russians who executed four Ukrainian servicemen.

Neither the Kremlin nor Russia's Ministry of Defence responded to questions for this film. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations about executions as propaganda and disinformation. And it has also accused Kyiv's troops of carrying out the same crime.

The UN has highlighted the spike in Russian soldiers executing Ukrainian POWs. But in its November report it did also say it had verified three instances where a Ukrainian FPV drone had killed a severely wounded Russian on the battlefield. This is one section of a Ukrainian video that shows the chaos of trench warfare.

Ukraine's Azov Brigade said their soldiers were clearing enemy positions. The Russians claimed their man was unarmed and begging not to be shot. Former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev was among those to respond. He quoted a World War TWo era poet, and apparently called for executions in kind.

Ukraine feels it's the victim of a rogue state that the west and other global powers have not pulled back into line and made to respect international norms. They see this as a continuum since Putin came to power, with the war in Chechnya, with the war in Syria, where Russia supported the Bashar al-Assad regime, to Russia's presence through the Wagner mercenary outfit in Africa, where they also committed appalling crimes against the local population.

International human rights lawyer Wayne Jordash leads Global Rights Compliance, an organisation that supports investigations by Ukrainian war crimes prosecutors. Jordash has worked on war crimes investigations in places like Iraq, Yemen and Syria. He says the big difference here in Ukraine is that criminality is an intentional part of Russia's war strategy.

The military operations are inherently criminal. They incorporate criminality as a matter of intent. It's quite clear looking at the patterns, what you see is, at the very least, a plan to control Ukraine, extinguish Ukrainian identity.

When Russian troops occupied areas like the southern city of Kherson, they detained men of all ages and professions, who were then tortured, sexually abused, and even killed - the aim, to subjugate the local population.

What that means is you have a campaign to commit war crimes. A campaign to commit crimes against humanity. And there is also a real possibility, in my view, of a campaign of genocide.

Ukrainian investigators have initiated more than 125,000 war crimes proceedings since the start of the full-scale invasion, and Jordash believes the executions fit into this overall campaign of criminality.

If you're trying to extinguish Ukrainian identity, or you are trying to destroy part of the Ukrainian group, as in a genocidal campaign, you need to remove the Ukrainian military, you need to remove the Ukrainian security apparatus. Because if you remove them you leave the rest of the population vulnerable.

Torture and sexual violence, it's instrument of Russians. When you look to this picture you have a clear understanding that people can't stay here even for a short time.

Oleksandra Matviichuk says these deliberate war crimes are designed to break the will of the people.

We are documenting how Russian troops deliberately shelling residential buildings, schools, churches, museums and hospitals.

How they forcibly taken Ukrainian children to Russia. How they abducting, robbing, raping and killing civilians in the occupied territories. It's a way how Russia tries to break people's resistance and occupy the country.

This is my friend Victoria Amelina, a Ukrainian writer. She was killed by Russian rockets in Kramatorsk when Russians deliberately hit a cafe in Kramatorsk. This is a memory.

This hell, which we now face in Ukraine, is the result of total impunity, which Russia enjoyed for decades. Russia commit horrible crimes in Chechnya, in Georgia, in Mali, in Libya, in Syria, in other countries of the world. Russia has never been punished. Russia believes that they can do whatever they want. We must break the circle of impunity - not just for people in Ukraine, but to prevent the next Russian attack to the next nation.

Matviichuk wants to create a special tribunal on aggression to hold Putin and Russia's political and military leadership accountable. She says they started the war, so they're responsible for all that followed. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Putin and his children's commissioner over the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children, and against military commanders for attacks on energy infrastructure.

But neither Russia nor the US are signatories to the ICC. And the US has even sanctioned ICC officials over their investigations into Israel's offensive in Gaza. Western sanctions on Russia, meanwhile, have failed to stop the war. In the quest for justice, Ukrainian investigators also face numerous challenges on the ground; a lack of access to frontline crime scenes, to resources, manpower and expertise, the sheer number of crimes and the number of people involved.

Putin does not sit in the Kremlin ordering rapes in Bucha. What he does, though, is design a policy which he understands and knows leads to crimes on the ground. And instead of changing his policy, he pursues it with vigour.

Therein lies his criminal intent. But proving it means you have to define the policy. You have to define the links of that policy to the crimes on the ground, and then you have to define specifically what his contribution was to that policy. Talk about a complicated jigsaw.

There's one case that we know of right now in Ukraine where a Russian soldier who is believed to have taken part in the execution of a Ukrainian soldier is on trial.

Dmitrii Kurashov, call sign 'Stalker,' is accused of killing a surrendered Ukrainian soldier. Prosecutors say the victim laid down his weapon and left his dugout with his arms raised. Kurashov then ordered him to kneel down and opened fire with an assault rifle.

Kurashov initially denied carrying out the execution and blamed one of his comrades. But later pleaded guilty in court, only to then tell journalists he was, in fact, innocent. This is the first case of its kind where a Russian soldier has been captured and put on trial over an execution.

The most famous trials were those held in Nuremberg, when 21 high Nazis faced their accusers. Hitler was dead, but these were his chief lieutenants.

Where justice has been effective, where war crimes have been successfully prosecuted, it has often been where leaders, or perpetrators, have been forced out of power.

Both Ukraine and Russia signed the Geneva Conventions, which set out how soldiers and civilians should be treated during war. But upholding the conventions and the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law is a different matter.

The international rules-based system is under enormous strain, because Russia is a member of the Security Council of the United Nations. It's a system that itself is partly paralysed.

The establishment of the United Nations in 1945 represented humanity's best attempt to prevent any repetition of the horrors of two world wars and the Holocaust.

Although there are jurisdictions set up to try and pursue war crimes that are happening globally, it is very difficult to exert international jurisdiction.

The International Committee of the Red Cross describes itself as a guardian of humanitarian law. It works behind the scenes and doesn't take sides. It's supposed to have the right to visit prisoners of war to check on their treatment and conditions.

So our tools are persuasion, are engagement, are dialogue. We don't have elements to enforce these treaties by force. And whilst we're here in Ukraine we have a straightforward relationship. We have a dialogue. We work with authorities. This is not mirrored the same way on the Russian Federation side.

Prisoner swaps do take place, and Ukraine needs to capture Russian soldiers to help free its own servicemen. Russia, on the other hand, already has far more Ukrainians in detention.

You know, every military person knows that on the battlefield you shouldn't rely on international humanitarian law. It was just a gentleman's agreement between some countries who said, OK, our soldiers should have possibility to survive, and your soldiers too.

And bit by bit, these exponents of mass murder moved closer and closer to the hangman's noose.

It'll be very hard for Ukraine and its western allies to bring the perpetrators of this horrific war to justice. Russia has not lost this war, and any peace deal will essentially be a ceasefire between two warring parties.

But the Ukraine war has to end. The young people are being killed at levels that nobody's seen since World War Two.

The problem is going to be that that justice may well fall victim to any compromise or peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow to end this war.

For many Ukrainians, it's that prospect that justice can't or won't be served that is so hard to accept.

The international order, which is based on the UN charter and international law, is collapsing before our eyes. And this long-lasting impunity, which Russia enjoyed, they all normalise evil. They create a new normal. And if we will not stop it, we can find ourselves in a world which will be dangerous for everyone, without any exception.

It's possible that we're witnessing more of these crimes because of the increasing use of first person camera drones. But it's highly probable that there are many more incidents we're not witnessing. Drones don't see everything. Recordings are not always taken, not always shared, not always clear.

How many of the missing have been executed? We just don't know. Like this soldier we saw who was led away into the forest, and this one left lying face down in the execution video featuring the hooded man.

What is clear, though, is that reports of executions are continuing, part of a pattern that goes beyond a few rogue units and beyond the soldiers who pulled the trigger. Documenting as much as possible about what really happened in each case can at least help to establish a bedrock of truth, if not the possibility of justice.

We are facing a prospect of a partial description, and I think it will have real consequences for persuading the rest of the world what really happened.

Even if we didn't find all the perpetrators, our children and our, you know, grandchildren should see what the Russians did here.

Putin attempts to convince the entire world that freedom, democracy, human rights, rule of law are fake values. If Russia succeeds, we can find ourselves in a world where space for freedom will be shrinking to the size of a prison cell.",,https://www.ft.com/video/cffdbfff-8bc3-4f9b-824c-b37c848f2cb4,ft

The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira Donegan,"The abductors wore masks because they do not want their identities known. On Tuesday evening, Rumeysa Ozturk exited her apartment building and walked on to the street in Somerville, Massachusetts – a city outside Boston – into the fading daylight. Ozturk, a Turkish-born PhD student at Tufts University who studies children’s media and childhood development, was on her way to an iftar dinner with friends, planning to break her Ramadan fast.

In a video taken from a surveillance camera, she wears a pink hijab and a long white puffer coat against the New England cold. The first man, not uniformed but wearing plain clothes, as all the agents are, approaches her as if asking for directions. But he quickly closes in and grabs her by the wrists she has raised defensively toward her face.

She screams as another man appears behind her, pulling a badge out from under his shirt and snatching away her phone. Soon six people are around her in a tight circle; she has no way to escape. They handcuff her and hustle her into an unmarked van. Attorneys for Ozturk did not know where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the US homeland security department that has become Trump’s anti-immigrant secret police, had taken the 30-year-old woman for almost 24 hours.

In that time, a judge ordered Ice to keep Ozturk, who is on an F-1 academic visa, in Massachusetts. But eventually, her lawyers learned that their client had been moved, as many Ice hostages are, to a detention camp in southern Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from where she was abducted.

In the video, before she is forced into the van, Ozturk looks terrified, confused. She may well have thought she was being robbed by street thugs; she did not seem to understand, at first, that she was being kidnapped by the state. She tries to plead with her attackers. “Can I just call the cops?” she asks. “We are the police,” one of the men responds. Ozturk remains imprisoned; she has been charged with no crime. In the video of her arrest, a neighbor can be heard nearby, asking: “Is this a kidnapping?”

The answer is yes. Ozturk is one of a growing number university students who have been targeted, issued arrest warrants, or summarily kidnapped off the streets by Ice agents. She joins the ranks of include Mahmoud Khalil, the Syrian-born Palestinian former graduate student and green card holder from Columbia University; Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian-born mechanical engineering doctoral student at the University of Alabama; Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia undergraduate who was born in South Korea but has long been a green card holder after immigrating to the United States with her parents at the age of seven; and Momodou Taal, a dual British and Gambian citizen who is studying for a graduate degree at Cornell University and has gone into hiding after receiving a summons from Ice to turn himself in for deportation proceedings.

Many of these students had some connection – however tenuous – to anti-genocide protests on campuses over the past year and a half. Taal and Khalil, in different capacities, were leaders of protests for Palestinian rights at their respective universities. Chung attended one or two demonstrations at Columbia. Ozturk co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper that cited credible allegations that Israel was violating international human rights law in Gaza and called on the university president to take a stronger stance against the genocide. In a statement regarding her arrest, a DHS spokesperson said: “Investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas.” They meant the op-ed.

The state department claims that some of these students have had their visas or permanent resident status rescinded – in a video of the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, taken by his pregnant wife, agents proclaim that his student visa has been revoked, but when they are informed that he has a green card, they say: “We’re revoking that too.” This unilateral revocation of green card protections, without notice or due process, is illegal. But that is not the point – the Trump administration clearly thinks of immigrants as a population with no rights that they need respect.

Rather, the point is that Trump administration’s promise to crack down on student protests against Israel’s genocide in Gaza has the effect of articulating a new speech code for immigrants: no one who is not a United States citizen is entitled to the first amendment right to say that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza, or that the lives of Palestinians are not disposable by virtue of their race.

It is up to those us who do have citizenship to speak the truth that the Trump administration is willing to kidnap people for saying: genocide is wrong, Israel is committing it against Palestinians in Gaza, and Palestinians, like all people, deserve not only the food and medicine that Israel is withholding from them, and not only an end to Israel’s relentless and largely indiscriminate bombing, but they deserve freedom, dignity and self-determination. This has become an unspeakable truth in Trump’s America. Soon, there will be other things we are not allowed to say, either. We owe it to one another to speak these urgent truths plainly, loudly and often – while we still can.

Here is another truth: that the US’s treatment of these immigrants should shame us. It was once a cliche to say that the US was a nation of immigrants, that they represented the best of our country. It is not a cliche anymore. For most of my life as an American, it has been a singular source of pride and gratitude that mine was a country that so many people wanted to come to – that people traveled from all over the world to pursue their talent, their ambition and their hopefulness here, and that this was the place that nurtured and rewarded them.

It may sound vulgar to speak of this lost pride after Ozturk’s kidnapping – all that sentimentality did nothing, after all, to protect her, and may in the end have always been self-serving and false. But as we grapple with what America is becoming – or revealing itself to be – under Donald Trump, I think we can mourn not only the lost delusions of the past but the lost potential of the future.

Ozturk – a student of early childhood education, and someone brave enough to take a great personal risk in standing up for what she thought was right – seems like a person the US would be lucky to have. Instead we are punishing her, terrorizing her, kidnapping her and throwing her away. She deserves better, and so do all of our immigrants – hopeful, struggling people who mistook this for a place where they could thrive. Who, in the future, will continue to think of the US as a place where immigrants can make a difference, can prosper? Who will share their gifts with us now?",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-trump-immigration-gaza,theguardian
"US government cuts imperil life-saving gun violence research. As doctors, we fear for the future | Jessica Beard and Elinore Kaufman","We don’t have a reliable count for how many people have been shot in the United States this year. We don’t know how many were shot last year either. Or the year before that. These most basic numbers should inform our gun violence prevention efforts. But they don’t exist.

This is the void of information that is created and persists when critical research is suppressed.

For those struggling to keep up with our erratic news cycle, what we saw unfold in February at the National Institutes of Health – with communication blackouts, funding freezes and cuts that will obstruct life-saving research efforts – may feel inconsequential. But make no mistake: the peril hanging over our country’s research efforts remains, and we in the gun violence research community are bracing ourselves for a dangerous situation we know all too well.

Our field has already experienced the devastating consequences of defunding and censorship. The story of how we got here begins in the 1990s.

Buoyed by the success of a public health approach in curbing traffic fatalities, researchers were hopeful that the same approach – track the problem, identify and test solutions, share findings and implement what works – could be used to prevent gun violence. The researchers got to work, and that work advanced rapidly. But some of the findings that emerged – in particular, that owning a gun increased one’s risk of being murdered in one’s home – angered the powerful gun lobby.

The late congressman Jay Dickey, who served as the National Rifle Association’s point person in Congress, took up the cause, introducing a provision into an omnibus bill that called for no federal funds to be used “to advocate or promote gun control”. The Dickey Amendment, passed in 1996, did not ban gun violence research outright, but research dollars within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reallocated, and the search for solutions was reduced to a trickle.

Sixteen years later, days after the Aurora theatre mass shooting, Dickey co-authored an op-ed reversing his stance. In it, he urged more scientific research, not less, and stated the truly “senseless” part of gun violence “is to decry these deaths as senseless when the tools exist to understand causes and to prevent these deadly effects”.

Six months later – and one month after Sandy Hook – then president Barack Obama directed the CDC to “conduct or sponsor research into the causes of gun violence and the ways to prevent it”.

But even with the public outcry that followed these mass killings, even with Dickey’s reversal, even with the president’s directive, the pause in research continued.

In 2018, on the heels of yet another high-profile mass shooting – this one at a high school in Parkland, Florida – then president Donald Trump signed a bill clarifying that the Dickey Amendment did not actually prohibit gun violence research.

But it wasn’t until 2021 that these policy changes would lead to the first dedicated federal funding for gun violence research in 25 years. By this time, we lacked the most fundamental tools to support gun violence research: expertise, mentorship, basic data, surveillance and the infrastructure to implement that critical public health approach to address and prevent gun violence.

The year the funding returned, 2021, was also the deadliest on record for gun violence in the US: 48,830 lives lost to guns over the span of just 12 months. As trauma surgeons in Philadelphia, we witnessed this heartbreaking moment in our country’s history firsthand. We were bombarded by the dying and the desperate and the so many who were harmed by this disease of gun violence – a disease our government had, for 25 years, not deemed consequential enough to cure.

Because the CDC tracks gun deaths but not the total number of people with non-fatal firearm injuries each year, we don’t know exactly how many people were shot during that 25-year funding pause. But we do know that hundreds of thousands of lives were forever altered or lost. And the research community could not ask why, could not ask how, could not find the answers we so desperately needed then and so desperately need now.

The suffering of our patients motivates us to do research to prevent gun violence – and the suffering we witnessed during the pandemic-related surge of gun violence very nearly brought us to our knees. We want research to stop our patients from being shot. We want research to stop them from dying.

The moment we find ourselves in today is especially painful because with renewed research efforts over the last few years, we had finally begun to untangle the root causes of gun violence and identify and test solutions. We had also been making progress with gun violence prevention policy nationally.

Three years ago, with bipartisan support, Congress passed the first major federal legislation addressing gun violence prevention in decades. Two years ago, we saw the creation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which implemented an all-of-government approach to tackling gun violence. And last year brought the landmark US surgeon general’s advisory, which deemed gun violence a public health crisis that demands attention.

What’s more, we’ve seen the rate of gun violence decreasing. Here in Philadelphia, the total number of shooting victims over the last year is down about a third from the same point just before the pandemic.

We had so much reason for hope, until January, when the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention was shuttered. Then in February, there were broad attacks on scientific research. And this month, the surgeon general’s gun violence advisory disappeared from the government’s website.

We loathe to think of what the next news cycle may bring.

We were among the first to document the rise in violence in 2020, anticipating the catastrophic years that would follow. Now, as we watch a cascade of executive orders threaten public health and public safety, as we see fears of economic disempowerment sowed across this country, we trauma surgeons are bracing ourselves for another surge in gun violence.

We should be filled with hope, not fear.

But here we are, fearing for our patients, for our communities and for the countless many who will die from this preventable and treatable disease of gun violence because the research that could have saved them was defunded and censored yet again.



No matter your political allegiances, no matter your life experiences, no matter your job, your income, your religion, your age or your race, we must stand firmly, together, in support of research that will help us understand this disease that causes suffering for so many – and one day, find its cure.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/trump-cuts-gun-violence-research,theguardian
Cryptocurrency will not save the Democratic party | Alex Bronzini-Vender,"Twice rejected by American voters in favor of Donald Trump, the Democratic party now faces its most severe crisis of identity in four decades. Nowhere is the party’s search for relevance in Trump’s America more desperate than in its embrace of cryptocurrency, a sector whose existence depends upon its ability to circumvent the financial regulatory state the Democrats spent a century constructing. How else to explain the Democratic representative Ritchie Torres – whose South Bronx district is the poorest in the United States – joining forces with the Republican Tom Emmer to champion cryptocurrency through their newly formed congressional Crypto caucus.

Congressional Republicans have always been uniform in their support for cryptocurrency: in May 2024, just three Republican House members voted against a bill to significantly relax regulations on digital tokens. But since 2016, the cryptocurrency industry has made steady inroads into the Democratic party. That convergence, if it continues, will represent a return to the pre-New Deal financial politics that the party spent a century rejecting.

Throughout American history, the politics of money and financial risk have been central to party coalitions. Not since the election of 1896, however, have the Democrats been the party of deflationary, restrictive “hard money”. As the historians Anton Jäger and Noam Maggor explain, the de-facto fusion of the Populist party with the Democratic party transformed it into a vehicle for those who saw money not as a neutral store of value, but as a political instrument that could serve developmental ends – in this case, directing investment to credit-starved regions of the country.

William Jennings Bryan’s defeat drove the party to moderate its more radical monetary positions. But notwithstanding the occasional inconsistencies, Democrats generally maintained the anti-deflationary stance established in 1896. Thirty years later, the Great Depression provided Franklin D Roosevelt with the mandate and the crisis necessary to complete this transformation: the United States abandoned the gold standard in 1933.

“Consumer protection” in its contemporary form only truly entered the American political lexicon in the 1960s, but this period established the contours of America’s politics of financial risk. The Banking Act of 1933 (often referred to as Glass-Steagall) separated commercial and investment banking to protect ordinary depositors from speculative excesses. The Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 imposed disclosure requirements on financial markets and established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Most critically, the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) ended the era of devastating bank runs by insuring deposits.

Collectively, these measures represented a fundamentally new relationship between citizens, banks and financial risk: the state would actively shape financial markets rather than simply enforcing contracts within them.

The post-war era saw the Democratic party further articulate that approach to “market-making”. The Employment Act of 1946 declared it the government’s responsibility to maintain “maximum employment”, while the Federal Reserve, treasury, SEC and FDIC enforced financial stability through interest rate caps, capital controls and heavy regulation of financial institutions. While occasionally inefficient, these policies contributed to remarkable stability. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have documented, the period from 1945 to 1971 saw virtually no banking crises in advanced economies.

The Clinton administration’s financial deregulation – culminating in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 and the deregulation of derivatives in 2000 – represented a significant retreat from these principles, and ended in the catastrophe of 2008. But, if only to offset the mounting risk they allowed the private sector to assume, the Clinton administration frequently sought to expand the FDIC’s responsibilities.

Pro-crypto Democrats, from Torres to the disgraced New York City mayor Eric Adams, argue that cryptocurrency aligns with progressive principles. “Blockchain technology can liberate the lowest income communities from the high fees of the traditional financial system,” Torres said at an industry-organized summit last year. Kamala Harris herself appealed to cryptocurrency as an opportunity for Black men. But cryptocurrency, at its core, subverts the tools for economic management Democrats have championed for decades.

The FDIC was created precisely because uninsured deposits catalyzed routine bank runs; cryptocurrency exchanges offer no comparable protection. The Federal Reserve’s sovereignty over the American monetary base enables it to expand the money supply during downturns to maintain employment; Bitcoin’s fixed supply explicitly rejects this responsibility. The SEC was established because unregulated securities markets harmed ordinary investors; cryptocurrency’s decentralization enables exchanges like Uniswap to operate outside its protective frameworks.

The industry’s “political investments” – to borrow the political scientist Thomas Ferguson’s terminology – are an undeniably defining force in American politics. By some counts, nearly half of all corporate campaign contributions in 2024 came from the crypto sector. But despite Kamala Harris’s substantial concessions to the industry, the top three crypto PACs leaned red by a margin of nearly 2:1. Harris’s promises to the industry were never enough to outweigh the Trump campaign’s proposal, running since late July, to enshrine crypto as a “permanent national asset” through a national bitcoin “stockpile”.

Modest deregulation is simply not what crypto is in the political game for. It requires nothing less than the seizure of the American state. And until Democrats can outmatch Trump’s handouts to the sector, crypto will stay with the Republican party.

Volatility is the basic roadblock to crypto’s further adoption. It is simply too risky for most people. No amount of regulatory tweaks will change that fundamental affliction: as long as cryptocurrencies are predominantly held as investments rather than used for transactions, their prices will remain highly sensitive to investor demand fluctuations. And the absence of traditional stabilization mechanisms, like central banks or reserve assets, contributes to the high volatility of crypto tokens. Put simply: if crypto is to grow, it’ll need both state backstopping and displacement of the traditional banking system altogether.

Trump has set about doing exactly this. His administration’s recently established “strategic bitcoin reserve” is, in effect, a state backstop for cryptocurrency. But the Trump administration’s designs extend far beyond “de-risking” crypto: their goal, as the political economist Martijn Konings observes, appears to be the destabilization of the traditional banking system itself.

At the behest of Elon Musk’s s0-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – itself named after Dogecoin, Musk’s cryptocurrency of choice – the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” packages and layoffs have already reduced the FDIC’s workforce by 10%. And Trump issued an executive order in mid-February requiring that the formerly independent agency submit to White House oversight.

The Trump team has floated replacing the already enervated FDIC with a gutted insurance scheme housed in the treasury, merging it with the office of the comptroller of the currency, or simply defanging it through mass layoffs and employee transfers. In either case, tighter executive control over banks’ balance sheets will render the financial system’s solvency contingent upon whether a particular bank is favored or disfavored by the president. It’s easy to imagine a resulting loss of confidence in the traditional banking system – an outcome that crypto advocates believe would work to their advantage.

If the Democrats wish to outcompete the Republican party for crypto dollars, then, they’ll need to offer the “industry” much more than deregulation. They’ll have to become active participants in engineering a return to the pre-New Deal politics of money and financial risk – the very positions against which the modern Democratic party defined itself. That would be a capitulation unprecedented even in the Democratic party’s long history of betraying the American working class.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/cryptocurrency-democratic-party,theguardian

AI may help us cure countless diseases – and usher in a new golden age of medicine | Samuel Hume,"View image in fullscreen Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan/The Guardian

AlphaFold might be the most exciting scientific innovation of this century. From Google DeepMind, and first reported in 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.

A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which was trained on a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.

In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’d pray for the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).

When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solving competition in 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!

I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to the AlphaFold server and produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.

Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to her latest study, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.

So what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In this recent Science study, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Through in silico testing (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.

AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:

Solving a decades-old problem: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level. Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, which targets the cancer protein CDK20, prevented liver cancer growth.

AI may help us cure countless diseases – and usher in a new golden age of medicine | Samuel Hume,"View image in fullscreen Illustration: Edward Carvalho-Monaghan/The Guardian

AlphaFold might be the most exciting scientific innovation of this century. From Google DeepMind, and first reported in 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.

A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which was trained on a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.

In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’d pray for the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).

When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solving competition in 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!

I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to the AlphaFold server and produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.

Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to her latest study, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.

So what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In this recent Science study, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Through in silico testing (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.

AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:

Solving a decades-old problem: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level. Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, which targets the cancer protein CDK20, prevented liver cancer growth. Helping to design a “molecular syringe”, which delivers a therapeutic protein payload into human cells.

There are companies built on AlphaFold, too. If AlphaFold is solving the lock, then AlphaProteo provides the key. AlphaProteo uses AlphaFold’s structures to design molecules that can bind to and modulate other proteins. This has been used to generate molecules that have never been made before – to target Covid-19, cancer and autoimmunity.

I was an independent observer in the Greenpeace trial. What I saw was shocking | Steven Donziger,"The stunning $667m verdict against Greenpeace last week is a direct attack on the climate movement, Indigenous peoples and the first amendment.

The North Dakota case is so deeply flawed – at its core, the trial was really about crushing dissent – that I believe there is a good chance it will be reversed on appeal and ultimately backfire against the Energy Transfer pipeline company.

I was part of an independent monitoring team of nine attorneys and four prominent human rights advocates who sat through every minute of the three-week trial, in a nondescript courthouse in rural North Dakota. Energy Transfer sued Greenpeace for alleged damages it claimed derived from the historic Indigenous-led Standing Rock protests in 2016 against the Dakota Access pipeline. Our presence in court was essential given that the company was able to shroud the trial in secrecy. There was no court reporter and there still is no public transcript or recording of the proceedings.

What we observed was shocking. Greenpeace lost, not because it did something wrong, but because it was denied a fair trial.

The legendary US human rights attorney Marty Garbus, a member of our team who has practiced law for more than six decades and who represented Nelson Mandela and Václav Havel, said it was the most unfair trial he had ever witnessed. This is precisely why many of us on the monitoring team believe there is a good chance Greenpeace will not pay the first dollar of the judgment and might actually recoup significant damages from Energy Transfer in a separate case in Europe. That case, currently being heard in Dutch courts, would entitle Greenpeace to compensation based on a finding that the North Dakota case is an illegitimate attempt to squelch free speech.

Many legal observers and first amendment scholars regard the North Dakota case as a Slapp harassment lawsuit. Slapps – strategic lawsuits against public participation – are designed not to resolve legitimate legal claims but to use courts to intimidate, silence and even bankrupt adversaries. By their very nature, they violate the constitution because they trespass on the first amendment right to speech. Allowing these cases to proceed almost always saddles the target with backbreaking legal expenses that can silence even the most resilient leaders and organizations.

This clearly was Energy Transfer’s plan, but the case was never just about Greenpeace. It was about using the organization as a proxy to attack the Standing Rock Sioux’s autonomy, leadership and sovereignty, as well as the broader climate justice movement, which is trying mightily to transition our country to a clean energy economy. The protests and the climate movement’s goals are a direct threat to Energy Transfer’s business model.

That might explain why Kelcy Warren, the founder and CEO of Energy Transfer, said the main purpose of the lawsuit against Greenpeace was to “send a message” rather than to collect money. A major Trump supporter and the mastermind of the lawsuit, Warren once said activists “should be removed from the gene pool”. After he made a large contribution to Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in 2017, the Trump administration quickly approved a key easement for the North Dakota pipeline that had been denied by Barack Obama.

The Greenpeace case had all the telltale signs of an illegitimate Slapp – so much so that it was originally thrown out of federal court in 2019. In that case, Energy Transfer openly claimed Greenpeace had engaged in a racketeering conspiracy and “terrorism” by speaking out against the pipeline and by conducting training in non-violent direct action at the site. The company quickly refiled the case in the more friendly confines of state court. Literally every judge in the judicial district where it was filed recused themselves because of conflicts of interest.

Here are some of the more fundamental problems we observed that clearly violated the fair trial rights of Greenpeace:

The jury – the most sacred due process protection available to a defendant – was patently biased in favor of the company. Seven of the 11 people seated had ties to the fossil fuel industry. Some had admitted they could not be fair, but the judge seated them anyway. There was no Native American or person of color on the jury even though issues of Indigenous rights were central to the trial.

Morton county, where the trial was held and where many of the protests took place, voted 75% for Trump in the last election and has extensive ties to the fossil fuel industry. In a pre-trial survey, 97% of residents in the county said they could not be fair to Greenpeace. Yet the judge refused repeated requests by Greenpeace to move the case.

Energy Transfer ran a major television and online advertising campaign in the county lauding itself in the weeks leading up to the trial. A newspaper called Central ND News, with articles critical of the protests, was also sent to county residents; Greenpeace believed Energy Transfer might have been responsible for it. But the court refused to allow Greenpeace to use court discovery procedures to determine how this unethical campaign to taint the jury pool happened.

Adding to the absurdity, Greenpeace was blamed for the entire protest movement even though it played only a minimal role. The protests were led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, on whose ancestral land the Dakota Access pipeline was being built. In fact, only six of the 100,000 people who came to the protests were from Greenpeace – yet Energy Transfer was able to convince the jury to hold the organization responsible for every dollar of supposed damages that occurred over seven months of protests.

Secrecy pervaded the proceedings. The court repeatedly refused to open a live stream to the public or to create and release transcripts. A request by media organizations (including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times) to access the live stream was denied. Thousands of key documents were sealed and thus hidden from public scrutiny.

The judge, James Gion, made evidentiary decisions that gutted Greenpeace’s ability to mount a defense. For example, a major expert report showed that the pipeline had leaked roughly 1m gallons of drilling fluids into drinking water sources used by millions of people. Greenpeace lawyers needed the document to debunk the argument that the pipeline was safe, but the judge refused to let the organization use it.

The 35-page verdict form was confusing and the results seemed to prove the jury was in fact confused. It appears the exorbitant damages number was calculated by pulling numbers out of thin air – including millions for public relations expenses, private security costs, which were being paid anyway, and refinancing costs due to various banks withdrawing from the project once they learned about the protests. (Lobbying banks is also constitutionally protected advocacy.)

The inability of Judge Gion to manage the case such that Greenpeace’s fair trial rights were respected was evident. It was almost excruciating to watch. It felt more like a choreographed show than an adversarial proceeding. Greenpeace was consistently – and, in our opinion, falsely – portrayed by the Energy Transfer lawyer Trey Cox as a criminal enterprise that exploited Indigenous peoples for its own gain. He used words such as “mafia” and “coded language” to describe the group’s operations. (Cox works for the same law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, that Chevron used to orchestrate my 993-day detention after I helped Amazon communities win the $10bn Ecuador pollution case.)

The verdict represents more than a financial blow against Greenpeace. It has huge and very troubling implications for free speech across the nation. The result threatens the rights of religious groups and political organizations. It implicates the rights of churches and charities. If the theory of the case stands, pretty much anyone in the United States can face ruin for exercising their constitutional right to speak on an issue of public importance – including adherents of conservative causes. It’s a corporate playbook that started with Chevron’s legal attacks on me and the Amazon communities in 2009. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher markets the playbook to its corporate clients.

The case also highlights the Trump administration’s broader attack on progressive activism. From proposed legislation that would allow the treasury department to unilaterally revoke the non-profit status of organizations deemed “terrorism-supporting” to the FBI’s reported plans to criminally prosecute climate groups, the goal is clear: suppress dissent. Greenpeace is in the crosshairs because its brand is global and its success in fighting polluters over the last several decades is outstanding.

This is why it is critical for Greenpeace and its allies to lean into the verdict and issue a call to action to the entire environmental movement and broader civil society organizations. Greenpeace is without question the world’s largest environmental activist group, with chapters in 25 countries. It gave birth to the non-Indigenous part of the modern environmental movement in the early 1970s and captured the imagination of the world by engaging in spectacular and creative actions to save whales in the north Pacific and to stop nuclear testing. Greenpeace needs to be protected in this critical moment.

There is more than a glimmer of hope. A hearing is scheduled for July in Amsterdam in the Greenpeace lawsuit against Energy Transfer. If Greenpeace prevails on appeal in North Dakota and wins in Europe, it might be Energy Transfer paying substantial sums to Greenpeace rather than the other way around.

There are realistic scenarios where Greenpeace emerges from this experience stronger than ever. The key is to keep grinding and calling out this abuse loudly and publicly. The world will respond.",2025-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/greenpeace-verdict-pipeline-north-dakota,theguardian
"Vita Coco Company, Inc. (COCO) – Jim Cramer’s Bullish Outlook on the Coconut Water Brand","We recently published a list of Did Jim Cramer Nail or Miss These 14 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vita Coco Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COCO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.

During the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer described the current stock market as a “short sellers paradise,” offering an ideal moment for those betting against U.S. stocks. He pointed to an important deadline approaching: April 2nd when major tariffs are set to take effect.

“We have a tariff deadline, beckoning a frightening deadline, actually April 2nd when the big tariffs are going to kick in, that means we’re headed for a moment of maximum fear as regular stock buyers either flee to the sidelines or move the money to Europe.”

READ ALSO: Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks?

Cramer emphasized that he does not see how the White House could back down from its stance, suggesting that if the administration wants to maintain credibility, it has no choice but to move forward with the tariffs. He explained that for President Trump, showing resolve by sticking to his promises is a signal of strength, even if it means sacrificing the stock market in the process. Cramer believes that this willingness to endure short-term market pain in favor of long-term trade objectives is a clear sign that the White House is committed to its strategy. He went on to say:

“For years, we’ve been conditioned to believe that everyone must do their part to get prices down because we don’t want inflation to get out of control. Unfortunately, someone isn’t doing it.”

The rising costs brought on by tariffs are forcing the Federal Reserve to pay more attention to inflation, complicating the financial space. Cramer remarked that this creates a difficult situation for money managers who now feel compelled to sell due to the economic uncertainty stirred up by Washington. Wall Street, he added, is already adjusting its estimates, factoring in the potential long-term impact of tariffs.

“But what happens in this market after the tariffs are implemented? Maybe another month of wrangling, maybe two months, maybe the whole summer. It could be real bad. So we end up with this build-in negative that could sink 10 ships.”

"NINGI Research short Vita Coco, says Costco to terminate contract","In a recently published report, NINGI Research says it is short Vita Coco (COCO), saying it is “nothing more than a one-trick pony grazing in a niche TAM.” “The stock is hyped as a unique growth story in the ‘Better for you’ beverage segment, but in 2024 sales just grew 4.5% YoY (vs. category at 15.4%) and its market share has been falling since early 2023. Compounding the problem, we uncovered that Costco (COST), Vita Coco’s largest private label customer, will ultimately terminate its contract with the company, despite having renewed their partnership in 2023. This decision will result in an estimated $90 million revenue shortfall for Vita Coco by the end of 2025 and position Costco as its strongest competitor. Vita Coco is suffering from structural internal deficiencies, such as undisclosed-related-party transactions and supply chain mismanagement. We believe the company focuses on misleading the markets while insiders offload stock,” the report reads. Shares of Vita Coco had dropped about 3% to $34.43 in morning trading.

The Weekly Sip: Jones Soda pops into zero-sugar cola | Vita Coco sweetens its coconut drinks lineup,"Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

The Weekly Sip is Food Dive’s column focused on the latest news in the rapidly changing and growing beverage sector. From inaugural product lines to big investments and controversial topics, this column aims to quench the thirst for developments in the category.

Jones Soda pops into zero-sugar

Craft beverage maker Jones Soda is debuting a zero-sugar variety of its signature cola as more consumers shift toward healthier drinks.

The zero-sugar cola is now available at more than 10,000 stores, including Kroger. The brand announced it will expand its zero-sugar offerings with the debut of Jones Zero Root Beer in the second quarter and Zero Dr. Jones in the latter half of this year.

Scott Harvey, the CEO of Jones Soda, pointed to a projection that the zero-sugar beverage market will more than double in size by 2030, according to Fairfield Market Research.

“We fully expect all of our Zero products to play an important role in building our revenues and profits,” Harvey said in a press release.

Coke Zero has grown exponentially for parent company Coca-Cola in recent years, with volumes increasing 13% in its last quarter and 9% overall in 2024.

The launch follows two recent additions to Jones Soda’s portfolio that also speak to larger consumer trends. Pop Jones is a prebiotic soda sweetened with real fruit juice and stevia, which competes in the same realm as Poppi and Olipop. And Fiesta Jones is a line of Latin-influenced sodas designed for convenience stores, in flavors like Mango Passion Fruit and Coconut Lime.

Vita Coco sweetens its portfolio

The latest products from the popular coconut water maker seek to satisfy consumers’ sweet tooth with a less sugary option.

Vita Coco Treats is debuting its Orange & Creme beverage, aimed to evoke an orange creamsicle with coconut milk and notes of orange zest and vanilla. The drink is the second launch under its Treats lineup, with the brand debuting Strawberries & Creme last year.

Jane Prior, the chief marketing officer at The Vita Coco Company, said in a statement the company saw demand for sweeter beverages.

“After the incredible response to Strawberries & Creme, we wanted to provide consumers with another beloved flavor—one that brings a fresh twist to a timeless favorite,” said Prior.

In the press release, the brand said it sees increasing demand for beverages that tap into nostalgia and indulgence among consumers.

Vita Coco, which debuted over two decades ago, has weathered fluctuations in the soft drink category and maintained its presence on shelves. In 2023, it expanded into the alcohol space in a collaborative RTD cocktail with Diageo’s Captain Morgan. The brand has also seen its use occasions grow with smoothies and mixed drinks as hydration and functional beverages continue to grow in popularity.

Artisan Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding The Vita Coco Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COCO) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

""Among our top Q4 contributors were Astera Labs, Veracyte and The Vita Coco Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COCO). Vita Coco is the leading coconut water brand in the world. While this niche category has relatively low household penetration today, it is slowly growing as the product benefits from increased awareness, availability and acceptance as an alternative to sugary sports beverages. The company’s supply chain is an important competitive differentiator. It has secured long-term supply agreements with a network of factories across six countries that process coconut flesh into food and other products, which allow Vita Coco to obtain their coconut water that typically would be disposed of as a wasted byproduct. We believe the company should be able to drive total category growth for coconut water, and its supply advantage should allow it to maintain a high market share, offer attractive pricing and expand margins. Recent earnings results displayed that end market demand remains robust, offsetting supply pressures from global shipping constraints.""

"Reflecting On Beverages, Alcohol, and Tobacco Stocks’ Q4 Earnings: Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)","Reflecting On Beverages, Alcohol, and Tobacco Stocks’ Q4 Earnings: Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)

As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q4. Today, we are looking at beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks, starting with Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO).

These companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the rise of cannabis, craft beer, and vaping or the steady decline of soda and cigarettes. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.

The 15 beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.6% below.

While some beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.1% since the latest earnings results.

Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)

Founded in 2004 followed by a 2021 IPO, The Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) offers coconut water products that are a natural way to quench thirst.

Vita Coco reported revenues of $127.3 million, up 19.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 4.4%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.

Martin Roper, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our exceptionally strong shipment performance in the fourth quarter benefited from retailer and distributor inventory levels rebuilding after the shortages of the prior quarter. We are pleased with our current inventory levels and excited by the current scan growth and indications from retailers of increased points of distribution in the coming resets. Collectively, we believe that this should help us deliver high teens branded growth in 2025.""

Vita Coco Total Revenue

Vita Coco pulled off the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 13.8% since reporting and currently trades at $32.98.",2025-03-10 09:04:52,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reflecting-beverages-alcohol-tobacco-stocks-090452751.html,Yahoo Finance

FEMSA’s Q4 Segmental Performance

Proximity Americas: Total revenues for the segment rose 13.2% year over year to Ps. 80,992 million (US$3.9 billion). On an organic basis, revenues improved 8.1%. The company reported a 3.8% increase in same-store sales for Proximity Americas, driven by a 6.8% rise in average customer tickets, offset by a 2.8% store traffic decline.



The Proximity Americas division had 24,462 OXXO stores as of Dec. 31, 2024. Operating income improved 18.7% year over year. The segment's operating margin grew 50 bps to 11.7%, driven by a higher gross margin, slower growth in South America and controlled selling expenses due to cost containment and efficiency measures, along with more stable labor costs. However, this was partially offset by higher operating expenses from ongoing investments in commercial capabilities, including segmentation, revenue management and data analytics.



Proximity Europe: Total revenues for the segment grew 21.5% year over year to Ps. 13,870 million (US$665 million). The segment benefited from strong sales across all countries, driven by commercial capabilities and a significant boost from currency appreciation against the Mexican peso. The Proximity Europe division had 2,778 points of sale as of Dec. 31, 2024. Operating income for the segment rose 9.9% year over year and the operating margin contracted 50 bps to 4.7% on higher operating expenses, caused by elevated administrative expenses and challenging comparisons from the B2B foodservice business.



Health Division: The segment reported total revenues of Ps. 21,824 million (US$1.05 billion), up 13.3% year over year. Revenues were aided by growth in Colombia, Chile and Ecuador, partially offset by a challenging competitive landscape in Mexico. The segment’s store base reached 4,661 locations as of Dec. 31, 2024. Same-store sales rose 9.4% in the quarter. The operating income improved 109.7% year over year, while the operating margin expanded 250 bps to 5.5%.



Fuel Division: Total revenues rose 8% year over year to Ps. 16,331 million (US$783 million).

S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Lululemon Stock Falls as Soft Traffic Weighs on Guidance,"Key Takeaways The S&P 500 dropped 2.0% on Friday, March 28, as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation revealed intensifying price pressure.

Lululemon shares tumbled after the apparel retailer provided an underwhelming outlook, citing soft traffic as consumers rein in spending.

Shares of W.R. Berkley moved higher as the insurer announced that Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance would take a 15% stake in the company.

Major U.S. equities indexes tumbled after Friday's inflation report came in hot, and consumer sentiment weakened significantly.

The S&P 500 lost 2.0% in the week's final trading session. The Dow closed 1.7% lower, while the Nasdaq plunged 2.7%. All three key market gauges ended the full week in negative territory as the sign of persistent inflation and consumer pessimism exacerbated concerns about escalating tariffs and the trajectory of the economy.

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares suffered the heaviest losses of any S&P 500 stock, plummeting 14.2% after the maker of yoga pants and other workout attire released its quarterly results. Although Lululemon topped sales and profit estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, the apparel company issued lower-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and full year. Executives cited a downturn in traffic as customers limit spending in the uncertain economic environment. JPMorgan analysts cut their price target on the stock, noting that tariffs and currency exchange effects could weigh on profit margins.

Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares sank 5.8% following a report in The New York Times about CEO David Zaslav's struggles to revitalize the entertainment giant's film studio, noting that ticket sales for its movies remain 40% below 2019 levels. The entertainment giant also announced a reorganization of its streaming content acquisition teams as it aims to align its strategy for its two streaming services, Max and Discovery+, across regions.

Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR) slipped 5.5%, giving back a portion of the strong gains posted since the discount retailer announced earlier this week that it would sell its Family Dollar brand for $1 billion. Although analysts indicated that Dollar Tree is in a good position to attract value-conscious consumers and could see an earnings boost following its separation from Family Dollar, they pointed to potential tariff-related headwinds.



W.R. Berkley (WRB) shares surged 7.5%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500 and reaching a record high after the insurance firm announced that Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance (MSI) would acquire a 15% stake in the company. According to a statement, MSI will purchase shares on the open market and from other third parties as it accumulates its position. The news release indicated that the agreement will not affect the firm's day-to-day operations.

Shares of Welltower (WELL), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on medical facilities and other health care infrastructure, added 2.3% after credit rating agency S&P Global upgraded its issuer rating. Welltower has improved its balance sheet and is expected to see additional improvement in its credit metrics over the next two years.

American Water Works (AWK), the largest regulated water and wastewater utility in the U.S., announced a plan to invest around $40 billion in its national infrastructure over the coming decade. Shares of the company advanced 2.2% on Friday.

Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)

Dollar Tree rose for a second day on Thursday, adding 11.18 percent to its valuation to end at $76.95 apiece as investors resumed bargain-hunting following announcements that it was divesting its struggling business unit for $1 billion.

According to the company, it inked an agreement with Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management for the sale of Family Dollar for $1 billion. Albeit an 88-percent discount from the $8.5 billion it allocated in 2015 to acquire the business, the sale is expected to unlock value for DLTR shareholders and position Family Dollar for future success.

“Under the experienced, dynamic leadership of Family Dollar President Jason Nordin, and with the financial support of Brigade and Macellum, Family Dollar will be well-positioned for growth as a private company. With the support of a dedicated team, Family Dollar will be able to strengthen its commitment to providing affordable and essential goods to customers so they can do more with less,” said DLTR CEO Mike Creedon.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of the year.

Should Investors Chase the Rally in Dollar Tree (DLTR) Stock After Q4 Earnings?,"Despite missing top and bottom-line expectations, Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares have soared +13% since reporting its Q4 results on Wednesday.

The rally comes as investors have applauded Dollar Tree’s announcement to sell its ailing Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management for $1.01 billion.

Dollar Tree’s Q4 Results

Dollar Tree reported Q4 sales of $4.99 billion which dropped from $8.63 billion in the comparative quarter and largely missed estimates of $8.23 billion. Still, CEO Mike Creedon stated the sale of Family Dollar will allow for the dedication of long-term growth, profitability, and returns on capital.

On the bottom line, Dollar Tree posted Q4 EPS of $2.11 missing expectations of $2.18 and falling from $2.55 per share a year ago.

Full-Year Results & Outlook

Rounding its operating year for fiscal 2025, Dollar Tree’s total sales fell 10% to $27.56 billion compared to $30.6 billion in FY24. Annual earnings were down 13% to $5.10 per share from EPS of $5.89 in FY24.

Dollar Tree expects Q1 sales in the range of $4.5-$4.6 billion compared to $7.63 billion in the prior year quarter. The company projects Q1 EPS to be between $1.10-$1.25 which came in below the current Zacks Consensus of $1.46 (Current QTR Below) or 2% growth.

Providing full-year guidance for its current FY26, Dollar Tree projects total sales at $18.5-$19.1 billion and EPS of $5.00-$5.50 which also came in below the Zacks Consensus of $5.94 a share or 16% growth. Based on Zacks estimates, Dollar Tree’s annual earnings are forecasted to rise another 11% in FY27 to $6.62 per share.

"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR): Among Stocks to Trade Without Tariffs and Interest Rate Fears","We recently published a list of 10 Stocks To Trade Without Tariffs And Interest Rate Fears. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) stands against other stocks to trade without tariffs and interest rate fears.

The Federal Reserve this week decided to keep interest rates unchanged, causing Donald Trump to lash out at the Fed chief. Jerome Powell seemed satisfied with the current state of the economy and the job market. What he did not like was the high uncertainty prevailing in the market.

There’s a good reason why the uncertainty is causing problems for the Fed. It can’t reliably predict the future path of the economy if it doesn’t know what data to put in its models. This is pretty much the same problem that stock analysts have. With tariffs causing problems for American businesses, many investors are seeing their portfolios shrink.

In such a scenario, we decided to look at stocks that are largely protected from both tariffs and interest rates. This ‘protection’ comes from the fact that their bull thesis is unlikely to be impacted by either of these factors.

To come up with the list of stocks protected from tariffs and interest rates, we looked at the recently released list of Goldman Sachs’ top stocks with micro-driven volatility.

Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) is a retail discount store that operates through Family Dollar and Dollar Tree segments. The company offers a variety of merchandise, consumable merchandise, and seasonal goods.

The company’s business is improving as shown by its Q3 earnings. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported a 3.5% rise in net sales with store traffic improving by 1.6%. Average ticket, the average amount spent by the customer per transaction, went up by 0.2% as compared to the previous year. Though the improvements are not huge, they still boosted the gross profit of the company by 7.6%. This is just a small step towards the eventual turnaround of the company.

Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) is considering shifting its focus to meaningful actions to improve business performance with things like multi-price offerings. Previously, the company sold everything for a dollar in its shop. More recently, this was bumped up to $1.25 but the multi-price offerings are where the growth lies. This will enable the company to be more flexible in terms of pricing. From the start of this project, the company has successfully tested its multi-price offering in 2300 stores and found favorable results. On average, the stores have shown a 3.3% growth in QoQ sales.",2025-03-27 19:43:57,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-tree-inc-dltr-among-194357998.html,Yahoo Finance

UBS Securities analysts on Thursday maintained their ""buy"" rating with a $95 price target, and said the Family Dollar sale ""will make the investment case on the stock compelling, despite various uncertainties like the impact of tariffs.""

Dollar Tree 'Removed Its Biggest Hurdle' to Shareholder Value

With the $1 billion Family Dollar brand sale to a pair of private equity firms, the analysts said they believe Dollar Tree has ""finally removed its biggest hurdle to create shareholder value."" The analysts said they believe investor sentiment should improve as Dollar Tree's earnings get a boost without Family Dollar.

The analysts cited management's comments that customers from across a range of income levels are turning to Dollar Tree as a sign that the company is ""well positioned to benefit"" from consumers trading down and looking for value.

In another research note Thursday, JPMorgan analysts kept their ""neutral"" rating while trimming their price target to $78 from $88 to reflect the value of Dollar Tree operating as a standalone business rather than with Family Dollar.

UBS's $95 price target is higher than the $78.29 consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, while JPM's new price target is in line with the average. Thursday afternoon, Dollar Tree shares had gained 10% to $76.31.

Jim Cramer Explains the Problem With Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree

A busy shopping aisle filled with discounted items in a retail store.

Dollar Tree (DLTR) has long been a story of unrealized potential, weighed down by its ill-fated $9 billion acquisition of Family Dollar (FD) a decade ago. The integration was fraught with challenges, as FD and DLTR operated with distinct business models—FD’s sales mix is 80% consumables, akin to Dollar General (DG), while DLTR maintains a more balanced mix between consumables and discretionary items. Despite efforts to optimize operations, FD remained a drag on DLTR’s financial performance, prompting management to finally cut its losses and put FD up for sale. The long-awaited divestiture was officially announced alongside DLTR’s Q4 2024 results, but the sale price—just $1 billion gross, or $800 million net—was shockingly low, representing a mere fraction of FD’s $13-14 billion in sales and an abysmally low 0.07x EV/Revenue multiple. Analysts had expected a significantly higher valuation, making the sale a major surprise.

The market’s immediate reaction was muted, but peeling back the layers reveals an attractive opportunity. DLTR’s true earnings power had been masked by FD’s struggles. Now, with the distraction removed, DLTR’s core business is exposed as fundamentally superior to DG’s in several key metrics. At $69 per share, DLTR trades at ~7.3x FY25 EBITDA and ~13x FY25 P/E, compared to DG’s 8.1x EBITDA and 15.4x P/E at $85. This spread was even more compelling when DLTR was trading at $65 at market open. Simply closing this valuation gap suggests DLTR should be at least $80, with further upside if dollar stores return to favor.

DLTR’s recent performance reinforces its case for a valuation premium over DG. Over the past two fiscal years, DLTR has consistently gained market share in its consumables segment, while FD stagnated. More notably, DLTR has demonstrated superior EBIT margins relative to DG, even though both companies saw margin erosion between FY23 and FY24. Given DLTR’s historically higher margins and peak EBIT levels of ~15% in FY22, it has a clear margin expansion potential that DG lacks.

Despite having a more discretionary-heavy mix, DLTR has outperformed DG in same-store sales growth (SSSG), even when lapping tough FY23 comparisons. Traffic trends have improved since FY23, benefiting from inflationary pressures driving consumers toward discount retailers. DG holds the advantage in store productivity, with higher sales per square foot ($260 vs. DLTR’s mid-$230s), but when factoring in profitability per square foot, DLTR is far superior, generating ~$18 EBIT/sqft versus DG’s ~$10.",2025-03-27 13:53:34,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-tree-inc-dltr-bull-135334155.html,Yahoo Finance
"Dollar Tree, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DLTR) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?","With its stock down 9.2% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Dollar Tree's ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Dollar Tree is:

26% = US$1.0b ÷ US$4.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2025).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.26.

See our latest analysis for Dollar Tree

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

Dollar Tree's Earnings Growth And 26% ROE

First thing first, we like that Dollar Tree has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. As you might expect, the 26% net income decline reported by Dollar Tree doesn't bode well with us. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.

That being said, we compared Dollar Tree's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.

Dollar Tree strikes deal to sell Family Dollar for $1bn,"Family Dollar operates 7,622 stores as of the end of FY24. Credit: refrina/Shutterstock.

Dollar Tree has confirmed a deal to sell its Family Dollar segment to investment companies Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management for $1bn.

The deal is subject to standard adjustments at closing and follows an exhaustive evaluation of various options for the Family Dollar segment. Dollar Tree acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for $9bn.

Reuters reports that the chain has been facing competition from Walmart, and e-commerce retailers Amazon, Shein and Temu.

The company closed 798 Family Dollar outlets over the fiscal year 2024 (FY24), reducing its store count to 7,622 from 8,359 in FY23.

Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon stated: “This is a major milestone in our multi-year transformation journey to help us fully achieve our potential.

“We will continue to grow and optimise our Dollar Tree business to maximise value for Dollar Tree associates, customers and shareholders with an enhanced focus on compelling initiatives, including our expanded assortment, significant planned new store openings across the United States, and transactions that advance our growth strategy.

“Under the experienced, dynamic leadership of Family Dollar president Jason Nordin, and with the financial support of Brigade and Macellum, Family Dollar will be well-positioned for growth as a private company. With the support of a dedicated team, [it] will be able to strengthen its commitment to providing affordable and essential goods to customers so they can do more with less.”

Dollar Tree anticipates netting $804m from the sale and expects tax benefits of $350m due to losses on the sale.

Dollar Tree reported a 4.7% increase in net sales to $17.6bn in FY24 year-to-date, and same-store sales growth of 1.8%.

The company attributed the growth partly to a 1.6% rise in customer traffic and a marginal rise of 0.1% in average ticket prices.

The company’s gross profit also saw an increase of 4.5% to $6.3bn with a steady gross margin of 35.8%.

Liberty Media Formula One is a unique investment that requires a long-term perspective due to the sport’s seasonal revenue fluctuations. The number of races per quarter significantly impacts earnings, making it essential to analyze trends over multiple years rather than in isolation. In 2024, Formula One saw a pivotal year with its growing popularity in the U.S., the initiation of a MotoGP acquisition, and a major leadership transition with the departure of longtime CEO Greg Maffei. His successor, Derek Chang, brings deep experience, having led NBA China’s successful expansion. Given that Liberty Media has long identified the U.S. and China as the most critical growth markets, Chang’s expertise in the Chinese market positions the company well for its next phase of global expansion.

Liberty Media has developed a vertically integrated model for Formula One, ensuring it controls various revenue streams beyond race weekends. The company owns its streaming services, sponsorships, ticketing analytics, licensed merchandise, and fan engagement initiatives like F1 Arcades and media partnerships. The Las Vegas Grand Prix was a milestone in this strategy, marking its first fully controlled race weekend, including track ownership and promotional events. This integration strengthens its ability to maximize revenue from each aspect of the fan experience. The company’s overarching strategy is to engage as many fans as possible worldwide, making races more accessible while generating new touchpoints through streaming, events, and merchandise. Tactical execution includes increasing race weekend value through expanded sponsorships, adding sprint races, and making each Grand Prix a full-scale entertainment event. The 2024 acquisition of Quint, a company specializing in experiential event planning, aligns perfectly with this strategy by enhancing the race weekend experience through curated travel and hospitality services.

Capital allocation remains a cornerstone of Liberty Media’s approach. The pending acquisition of MotoGP is a strategic move that mirrors Formula One’s core strengths, tapping into a similarly passionate fanbase and high-speed, action-packed events. MotoGP’s shorter race duration also aligns well with modern audiences’ shifting preferences toward more digestible content. Meanwhile, Liberty’s classic John Malone-style transactions continue with plans to spin off Quint and its Live Nation holdings into a separate entity while consolidating Formula One, its upcoming 86% stake in MotoGP, and its ownership of the Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets under a streamlined structure.",2025-03-11 17:26:28,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/formula-one-group-fwona-bull-172628354.html,Yahoo Finance

Q4 2024 Liberty Media Corp Earnings Call,"Great. Thank you, Shane. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be speaking with all of you today. For those of you who don't know, while I officially started as Liberty's CEO 27 days ago, my relationship with Liberty Media goes back to 1997 when I first met John while working for TCI. We've had many points of professional overlap over the years at DirecTV, Starz, and more. Most recently, I've been fortunate to serve on Liberty's Board since 2021. As a Board member, I am uniquely familiar with the Liberty structure, culture, and mandate, which has enabled a seamless and efficient transition to CEO as we hit the ground running with a busy year ahead. Even as a director for years, we've been asked, what is the long-term Liberty playbook? The answer has been consistent. The Liberty playbook is one of constant evolution, maximum flexibility and an appreciation for change to drive long-term shareholder value. That is and will remain true going forward. Our team will speak in more detail about the businesses, but I'll make some brief remarks first regarding our near-term priorities for 2025. First, we are working towards the close of the Dorna acquisition. The MotoGP season kicks off in Thailand on March 2. There will be a 22-race calendar compared to 20 races in 2024, featuring a new track in Hungary and a return to the Czech Republic for the first time since 2020. We expect an exciting season ahead. MotoGP unveiled a new brand refresh and identity at the end of last season, aimed at expanding its cultural relevance beyond racing. We look forward to working with Dorna to take this sport to the next level on closing. The Phase 2 regulatory process is progressing, which is a more in-depth review by the European Commission and not uncommon in major transactions like these. We extended the long stop date for regulatory clearance to June 30, 2025, and are working constructively with the regulators towards approval. Our second priority is continuing our path towards structural simplification and better highlighting the value of our Live Nation equity stake. And finally, we will continue to drive the momentum at Formula One. The sport is coming off a record 2024 with high visibility into an excellent year ahead. I have spent a significant amount of time with Stefano and the F1 management team since the start of this year and look forward to supporting them going forward. Chase Carey's involvement and partnership as a Liberty Board member has and will continue to be important as we leverage his expertise to continue momentum at F1. I do want to touch specifically on the Las Vegas Grand Prix as this is a key area of focus. Please note that we don't provide specific economics for any Grand Prix. Particularly for Vegas, we see material benefit accrue from LVGP to the broader F1 ecosystem, across sponsorship, hospitality live entertainment, licensing and data. Vegas has served as a very successful test bed for product expansion and played a key role in F1's growth in the Americas, which is a continued focus. The event we held recently at the O2 in London and the upcoming F1 movie are also powerful marketing engine for all of our F1 fans, but particularly for Vegas and the North American fans. 2024 stand-alone event economics for Vegas missed internal expectations on revenue and OIBDA. The team has moved very quickly, however, to enact changes that will benefit 2025 and support a financially successful race for F1 and continued growth and positive impact for the Las Vegas community. We now have two years of real data to understand what tickets and products sold well the demographics of the fan base and the overall cost structure of the event. As a result, we are making further revisions to ticket product and pricing strategy, leveraging this data and as importantly, we are actively managing our cost structure. Given the halo effect to F1 we've discussed, we reorganized the structure of LVGP last month to integrate it fully into our London team and maximize those continued benefits. This change leverages the strong organization we have in London today across commercial, finance and more. At the same time, we are bolstering certain parts of the local Vegas team. This includes bringing the ticketing sales function back in-house and offering a high-touch on-the-ground presence, which was a key learning from last year. We will continue our partnership with Quint and benefit from their expertise in VIP hospitality and F1 experiences. Finally, we are also bolstering our partnership with local players. We believe that continuing to expand the F1 platform in bold and new ways is critical and ultimately leads to both increased and new sources of revenue. We want to take these opportunities for long-term benefit even if there are early bumps in the road. We have a clear handle on near-term priorities for Vegas to improve, and we are confident in the value it provides. I look forward to sharing more as we progress. With that, I want to thank John, the Board and the Liberty team once again for this opportunity. To our analysts and shareholders, I look forward to getting to know you better in the months and years ahead. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for more on our financial results.

Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in the most recent Form 10-K followed by Liberty Media with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures for Liberty Media, including adjusted OIBDA. The required definition and reconciliations for Liberty Media Schedule 1 can be found at the end of the earnings press release issued today, which is available on Liberty Media's website. Speaking on the call today, we have Liberty's President and CEO, Derek Chang; Liberty's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; Formula One's President and CEO, Stefano Domenicali, and other members of Liberty management will be available for Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Derek.

Brian Wendling

Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Just a quick reminder that the merger of SiriusXM with Liberty SiriusXM closed on September 9. Therefore, the results of Sirius XM Holdings are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

At year end, Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $2.6 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of cash at F1 and $78 million of cash at Quint. The cash balance as of year end includes proceeds from the previously mentioned on share issuance, which was completed in August.

Total Formula One Group attributed principal amount of debt was $2.9 billion at quarter end, which includes $2.4 billion of debt at F1, leaving $528 million at the corporate level. F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and their leverage at 12/31 was 1.3 times. As a reminder, all MotoGP transaction-related financing is in place and deal contingent.

Turning to the F1 business. Just a reminder that it's best analyzed on an annual basis, given variability in year-over-year race calendar. Total revenue grew 6% in 2024, with growth across all primary revenue streams.

Revenue growth was primarily driven by the two additional races held and contractual increases across all of our revenue streams as well as the benefit of new sponsors, which drove a 10% increase in sponsorship revenue year over year. As Derek mentioned, the Las Vegas Grand Prix did miss expectations primarily on ticket sales, offsetting some of the race promotion revenue growth year over year despite the two additional races.

Other F1 revenue was relatively flat in 2024, we saw strong growth in Paddock Club revenue at most events in 2024 as well as increases in freight and licensing. This was offset by softness in certain hospitality offerings at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

Team payments as a percent of pre-team adjusted OIBDA was 61.5% in 2024, down from 62.6% in 2023. We continue to expect incremental leverage to the term of the current Concorde Agreement which runs through the end of the 2025 season.

Other costs of F1 revenue was broadly flat at 31% of total revenue and SG&A was 8% of total revenue, both in line with historical averages. Adjusted OIBDA margin improved nearly 70 basis points year over year. And then looking briefly at corporate and other results in the fourth quarter.

Revenue was $118 million, which includes Quint results and approximately $13 million of rental income related to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Plaza, approximately half of which is variable and recognized in the fourth quarter in connection with the event.

Corporate and other adjusted OIBDA loss was $2 million and includes Grand Prix Plaza rental income, Quint results and corporate expenses. Quint results in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by the F1 experiences across the six races held including Vegas as well as the MBA Cup.

Looking to 2025, F1 will host 24 races consistent with 2024. And while I'm reticent to encourage quarterly modeling, please note that the race count and composition will be different in each of the four quarters this year compared to 2024. In part, this is due to our efforts to increase regionalization of the calendar in support of our net zero pledge by 2030 and and for enhanced efficiency in our freight logistics.

We are in a strong financial position as we head into 2025. The majority of our revenue is under contract, including our sponsorship revenue, which has been derisked by pulling the pipeline forward given the level of announcements made prior to the season.

This also allows our team to focus on future sponsorship pipeline with an emphasis on high-value and high-quality partners. The other revenue streams will predominantly be driven by renewals and escalators this season. On Vegas, we are very focused on top and bottom line improvement relative to 2024 results and there are clear steps already taken in process to achieve this.

Turning to a few cash items. F1 estimated cash tax rate in 2025 to be low double-digit percent of adjusted OIBDA, increasing modestly in future years. Total CapEx incurred at the Formula One Group in 2024 was $75 million, approximately $73 million of which was incurred at Formula One and includes CapEx related to technical improvement projects for IT and F1 TV as well as the Las Vegas Grand Prix track and paddock building improvements.

Note that the operating company CapEx has historically trended at 1% to 2% of total F1 revenue. excluding onetime Vegas related CapEx, and we expect this range to be broadly consistent in 2025.

Turning to the Liberty Live Group. There's attributed cash of $325 million and $400 million of undrawn margin loan capacity related to our Live Nation margin loan. As of February 26, the value of the Live Nation stock held at Liberty Live was $9.9 billion, and we have $1.15 billion in principal amount of debt against these holdings. Liberty and F1 are in compliance with their debt covenants at quarter end.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stefano to discuss Formula One.

Stefano Domenicali

Formula one finished 2024 with solid financial results, excellent rating and in a very strong position heading into 2025. The on-track competition intensified throughout the season, and we expect an even closer fight when we begin the new season in Melbourne. The strength of our brand and fandom translated to strong financial results in 2024.

We continue to benefit from favorable supply and demand dynamics across our revenue streams. There is strong demand to be part of the F1 ecosystem, whether in Austin races, airing our content, partnering on sponsorship activation or enjoying our hospitality products.

This is met with relatively limited supply across the board. We've seen this benefit commercial agreements, where our teams made incredible progress in 2024, signing a number of agreements that provide clear visibility for near-term financial momentum beyond.

As of year end, F1 had $14.4 billion in future revenue contracted under multiyear agreements. On race promotion, we remain focused on balancing growth and heritage markets. as reflected in the extension of our agreement to race in Shanghai throughout 2030 and the renewals of both Monza and Monaco throughout 2021.

We also extended the Netherlands for one year and Belgium under a multiyear rotational deal with the opportunity for another race to fill the alternating year lots. We remain in a strong position with demand from potential future race venues across the globe and will assess any potential new calendar addition against strategic requirements for both the business and the sport.

Turning to Media Rights, our F1 TV product continued to grow at a healthy rate, with subscribers up 15%. The US remains its largest market, Capitalizing on this success, we are launching a new higher-priced premium tier this year to target avid fans.

It will offer enhanced functionality, including 4K ultra high definition, Multiview, a virtual pit wall and the ability to watch across up to six devices. Brian touched on some financial inputs for the season entering in 2025, I am particularly proud of the growth in sponsorship, both in renewal terms and new partnership that will take effect this year.

This includes our landmark deal with LVMH as a global partner Lenovo becoming a global partner after being an official partner since 2022, our renewal with Pirelli as well as bringing on Amex, Santander and KitKat as official partners.

More recently, we announced the extension of our partnership with crypto.com through 2030 and Allwyn, a global lottery operator, as an official partner. Our success in signing this partnership ahead of the season now allows the team to spend 2025 focuses on growing and executing the pipeline of new deal and renewal uplift opportunity for 2026 and beyond.

While 2025 is clearly a standout year in sponsorship, I am optimistic about the discussion we have in developing, including new regional deals, upsells and the potential for movement of our existing sponsor within tiers as the bar has been raised across the board. The team is also continuing to innovate on our hospitality products.

The Vegas race allow us to test different concepts and target hospitality offerings and we expect variation to be deployed at races this year. Michelin Star chef, Gordon Ramsey was announced as the partner of our most premium hospitality products F1 Garage.

We are also pleased to extend our multi-decade relationship with Do&Co for another 10 years of Paddock Club delivery. We will continue to work with them on enhancing our Paddock Club offerings.

Looking at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, we delivered another outstanding spectacle on track, creating buzz throughout North America and earning the Promoter the Year award from Auto Sport. Moving into 2025, we are taking an important step in the race evolution and are fully integrating its operation into our F1 team in London.

This will further maximize the value we believe the Vegas race provides for F1 Brothers' commercial activities. In addition to being an excellently generator of a commercial deal, Vegas has been a successful test bed of innovation that we are now extending elsewhere in Formula 1. A few recent examples include expanding our licensed product and merchandise offering.

The global partnership with Gordon Ramsey after his involvement in Vegas and building a new CRM system for all of F1, which will enhance our fund targeting. We also know that Vegas race is key to our expansion strategy in the US.

Following the second year of the race, we have a clear vision of the changes needed to improve the race stand-alone economics and maximize the overall value accruing to Formula One. Turning to broader fan engagement.

Nielsen published a set of fan data in December 2024, confirming F1 is the most popular annual sporting series globally with over 750 million fans and growing. Younger and female fans are growing the fastest, a statistic that few sport can claim.

In the last five years, the under 35 years old and female fan demographics have both increased by over 50%, and with steady growth, especially in markets like the US and China. In 2024, 1.6 billion cumulative TV viewers tuned in for races.

With the number of unique viewers up 9% year over year. An additional aggregate audience of most -- of almost $500 million watch the F1 content on streaming platforms including 230 million watching YouTube highlight reels on the F1 channel.

We saw TV growth, especially in China, Canada, Australia, Argentina and the Middle East. As we are increasing our global fan base. At the same time, our European stronghold markets, Italy, UK, Germany, were also up year over year. Average viewership per race was 66 million nonlinear platforms with an additional EUR 20 million estimated on digital platform, including F1 TV.

Nielsen is now capturing YouTube audiences in this in their measurement. Which will be included in our reported viewership numbers beginning in 2025. This will provide a more comprehensive view on how current fans consume sport content, and we aim to integrate new sources and platform over time.

On social media, Formula 1 ended the year with 97 million followers across the platforms, up 38% year over year. If we look at the comparable social media platforms, where all major sports operate, for the fifth consecutive years, F1 has been the fastest-growing global sports league for follower growth.

We also reached an audience of 4 billion globally through our proactive media activity in 2024, showing the breadth of our reach. At races strong attendance trends continue throughout the season with the 2024 seeing 17 sellout crowds and 10 new attendance records. Over 6.5 million people attended races in 2024. A new record, growing 9% over 2023. Four races welcomed crowds of over 400,000.

The Paddock Club also saw a record attendance hosting 58,000 total guests across the season, up 20% on 2023. Despite the strength of these metrics, we know that only a fraction of our fan base is able to attend the race.

I think a key focus of our ongoing growth strategy is to reach fans in new creative ways to maintain their interest, raise awareness and continue the growth momentum. This is our F1 Always On strategy and ensuring F1 is present beyond the '24 race calendar. This approach is supported by our experiential licensing initiatives.

Following successful international venues in Boston and DC in 2024, F1 Arcade is planning to open four additional US location in 2025, including Las Vegas and Denver. The F1 exhibition sold almost 600,000 tickets across all venues 2024. Connecting our fans with F1 rich history. Buenos Aires will be the fifth city to host the exhibition when it's opened on March 22 and is the first top of a planned multi-country South American tour.

Amsterdam was recently announced as the six locations set to open in April 2025. Leveraging learnings from other license activation Grand Prix Plaza in Las Vegas is launching a series of new year-round activities beginning at the end of March. This site will be the North American home of the sport, especially serving our growth US fund base.

In partnership with the Round Room Live, our partner in the F1 exhibition, Grand Prix Plaza will host three unique and immersive experience, F1 Drive, F1X and F1 Hub and we also have three new private demand spaces available for rent. We're building momentum in consumer products and other licensing areas, which we expect will be both economic lucrative and provide new touch points for our diverse fan base.

Our partnership with LEGO launched with the product range featuring all 10 teams engaged content across LEGO digital platform and presence at race weekends, including fan zone activations. Our partnership with Mattel is launching throughout 2025, with eight F1 teams brought to life across a range of products and presence at select races, including Hot Wheels activation and retail opportunities.

Sustainability initiatives remain a priority, and we are on track to be net zero by 2030. In 2024, we began our investment in sustainable aviation fuel and expect our initiatives here will have provided an approximately 19% reduction in 2024 relative emissions compared to traditional aviation fuel.

We are already well advanced in our plans to expand the sustainable aviation fuel initiative further in 2025. Also in November, we announced a formal diversity inclusion charter agreed by all 10 teams, F1 and the FIA. This is an important step and invites collaboration across the ecosystem to produce impactful results.

Looking ahead to the 2025 season and beyond, we are working to capitalize on our momentum and establish key building blocks for future growth. I'm confident our brand awareness will continue growing, especially as we look to the Apple movie, which will premier in June and the impact of our recent high-profile season launch event held at the O2 in London.

The launch event was the first of its kind featuring all 10 teams revealing their 2025 deliveries, top-tier entertainment and a gathering of the entire Formula 1 community to celebrate our 75th anniversary. Over 15,000 fans packed the O2 while over 40 global broadcasters aired the show live.

On digital channels, including YouTube drew 7.5 million total live viewers, making it F1 most successful livestream ever. The media buzz was incredible and over 2,000 pieces of global content were published within 24 hours of the event.

From a sporting perspective, this year, we expect an intense fight on the track as teams continue to converge after a very competitive 2024 season. Driver changes are plentiful with many rookies entering the grid, demonstrating the success of the F2 and F3 support series in preparing drivers for Formula 1.

We also expect an interesting balance as the teams have to focus both on 2025 performance but also prepare the significant changes required by the new technical regulations taking effect in 2026. We look forward to see the cars take to the track this weekend.

Avanti Tota, full speed ahead. And now I will turn the call back over to Derek. Thank you. Bye-bye.

Derek Chang

Thank you, Stefano. I think we'd like -- now like to open the call for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Derek Chang

(Operator Instructions) Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.

Ben Swinburne

I have two questions, one for Derek and one hopefully for Stefano. I know he said by, but hopefully, he is still there. Derek, welcome to the wonderful world of quarterly earnings calls. Nice to talk to you again. Could you talk a little bit about the message you have to Liberty shareholders around strategy?

I know you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks. But like what are your strategic priorities for the year? And -- any comment you can share on your philosophy around M&A?

Derek Chang

I think Liberty obviously tremendous track record on the M&A front. At the same time, investors really like the pure plays that you have and are continuing to create. So I would love to hear some thoughts there and then I have an F1 question for Stefano is there.

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, Ben, and thanks for the warm welcome there. I guess I would say that I've touched on some of the points in terms of our near-term priorities, closing Dorna, the structural simplification that we've discussed and obviously, a huge focus right now on F1 and continuing the growth trajectory that that's been on and helping Stefano and his team accomplished that.

We've got a lot on our plate. But as you get through the year and we roll forward, I would think that a lot of what we've done in the past would reflect on what we might do in the future. We've always been an opportunistic place.

And I think as those opportunities present themselves, we will certainly hopefully be active and be able to continue to build on the assets that we have in terms of tuck-ins or adjacencies and things like that.

But then as we start to look beyond that, where there is opportunities that involve premium IT ability to monetize and commercialize along the way that we've done with some of the assets like F1. Those we would look at pretty seriously. But for now, again, back to the near-term priorities that we've already discussed.

Ben Swinburne

Yes, Stefano you guys a lot going on between Concored and media rights and everything else, but there's a lot of focus, as you can imagine, on the US media rights right now. There's some press reports that F1 and ESPN have moved on from each other.

I guess I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you're feeling about the demand for the US broadcast rights for F1 today, whether we still should think there's going to be an increase from your current deal.

And any thoughts on including or excluding F1 TV in the package that you're bringing to market would be appreciated.

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, Ben. As you said, there's lots of going on in this month, but that's the life of Formula One. Every day is a new day, but a lot of things that are always opportunities.

First of all, let me say that with regards to ESPN and Formula One, let me say that I can deny the situation that is negative because, first of all, we need to be thankful for what ESPN is providing to us. We are very happy about the quality of the service.

We need to remember that they were first to believe in our projects. So therefore, the fact that at the end of the exclusivity period, they are not put in place on a formal offer. It doesn't mean that the discussion are going ahead.

Actually, it's the other way around. So there are still a lot of discussions to try to find the best solution. And of course, now, as we always said, are the months where other players around the table.

And we cannot deny the fact that there is a lot of interest around our products. We are fortunate enough to have compelling content and growing fan base and a strong demand for different situation from various parties. As we always said, there is the big point related to the fact that from one side, we always want to maximize the monetization of our media right.

But on the other side, we need to make sure that also in terms of awareness, in terms of growth of our fan base, we need to try to find the best way in terms of reach. Therefore, these are the two questions -- the two points that are on the table.

We have a lot of players that we are discussing with I think the hot months will be the next one before summer where we should have a better picture. And that's for sure something that I believe will happen because, as I said, we are really in a situation where our possibility to grow and also to offer to them the possibility to give the -- to our forecasted partner any better commercialization on how they can explore their rights are possible.

And I can say that the digitalization and also the experience of out the broadcaster during in Europe and part of the work could be an essential part of what could be the discussion we're going to have with them. And that's what I would say with regard to the media right. I'm sure that the Derek, if you want to say something more on that before I can taste on the situation on Concored.

Derek Chang

Thanks, Stefan Yes, I mean I love talking about media, right. But I would add to that, that people tend to look at these sorts of discussions somewhat simplistically sometimes and really focus on the rate and the race broadcast.

But when you think about media rights in today's world, the broadcasters, the distribution partners and the IP holders, I think it's a much more involved relationship than just the event. And I think that's to everyone benefit in the ecosystem and how people can use our IP, not just through the event but through the other forms of content through the activation and hospitality even and things like that come into play.

And I think that we, at One, continue to be very well positioned to the content offer we have. We've invested a lot of money in our own content production, which can also be very helpful to the potential broadcast partners.

Ultimately, as everyone knows in this world, things hinge up a little bit on supply and demand and at the competitive process that unfolds situations like this and what the availability is of other rights around the time frame vis-a-vis which of our potential partners may be looking for IP like ours at this time.

And so not to overcomplicate the answer, but I think we do believe that there is a robust process that will unfold here. I think to use an F1 analogy. We're early in the race, and people are still feeling off the track per se. But I think also to use F1 analogy, it's going to be a fast rate, and we're going to move pretty quickly, hopefully to come to conclusion as we get to the end of the middle of the year and later this year.

And just to echo one thing that Stefano said, A lot of times, the people on the outside tend to frame these things as ESPN said they didn't want the F1 rights going forward, and it's very, again, found by way to describe the relationship has actually been quite a productive and constructive relationship.

And I personally have had a long-term relationship with the ESPN. F1 has had a great relationship with ESPN, and we'll continue to see how these conversations unfold.

David Karnovsky, JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky

And welcome to Derek. On Las Vegas, as you noted, the race missed your budgeting and I get the need to look at this holistically, given its impact to sponsorship and other rights.

But I wanted to see if you could dig in a bit on the past year in 2025 in the next few years, specifically growing revenue and also managing the cost base to get tend back towards some of those original stand-alone targets you had laid out, if that's still the goal.

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, David. I mean, we do believe that, as we always said, this is an incredible Grand Prix on which we need to keep working and make sure that it will stay as we believe at the top of the range because the benefit of this Grand Prix, as we said, that provides a broader financial benefit to the ecosystem of Formula One.

What we are focusing with the action that we have delivered is to make sure as you said correctly, we need to make sure that we focus our attention on the cost structure of the situation that we have to manage in Vegas. We need to have even a better local relationship because that's the key of the success. And by the way, in that respect, one news that I believe it's an important for the ecosystem of the communities that we have moved the race time, two hours earlier.

And that's why because we believe that it's important always to be connected to the community. And we do have to forget that the community is benefiting with a big impact on their economic P&L on the weekend of the races.

And then of the fact that we believe that by integrating all the function of Vegas LVGP together with London will help boost the synergy that we can use by knowing the system and the experience that all the other Grand Prix are, let's say, investor government given to us.

We don't have to forget that we were having, as Derek was mentioned in his speech at the beginning, any data relevant for that community. And now we are taking that in the way to build the system in order to formalize the right packages, the right offer.

And on the other side, we have always said since the beginning that we know that when there is a new approach going ahead, the first year is a learning curve that will take the right time to make the right strategic decision because, as we said, this is an incredible event that will continue to be one of the most important events in the near the future. That's what I could say on that perspective.

Derek Chang

Yes, I'd like to just add that if you step back for a second, I think that LVGP has been a huge success to put on an event like that in the short amount of time that our team here in Denver and London were able to do that over the last couple of years, it's been pretty impressive.

And I think we've talked at length about the benefit to the F1 ecosystem as a whole, whether it's the media, the sponsorship, fandom growing here in the US, all that stuff had been hugely impacted by what we've been able to accomplish in Las Vegas.

I think we all here were disappointed by the -- some of the financial metrics in the early going here. But those in my mind are all durable and fixable. And as both Stefan and I have already alluded to, we're already working on those plans and feel comfortable that we will see a nice improvement there over the course of the year.

David Karnovsky

Okay. And then Stefan, I was interested to get your expanded view on GM and Cadillac and the decision to admit them as an 11th team. We had the perception of some resistance to this in the past.

So I was interested to understand better any change in your thinking and what this can add to the sport, especially in the US? And -- can you just refresh us on how the entry fee works to the teams and what role is F1 asset any there?

Stefano Domenicali

No, thanks for that. It's important to certify that position. We always said that Cadillac is giving and will give an incredible boost to the ecosystem of Formula One. We were referring to other situations that were handled before, but now the picture is totally different.

Therefore, I think the Cadillac's preparing the entry and in terms of preparing the season because it would not be easy situation for them to be in such a high tech and evolve the sporting platform. They are doing everything in order to show how Cadillac is really involved into the sport.

Now there is the formality that is related to the process that it's almost ready together with the FIA, that's to be an update. And whenever this will be ready, it should be not too long. There would be a an update to formalize what basically is already happening. So they will be ready to fight against together with the other teams for next year.

And that is the evolution that, as you know, GM has taken as a fact that they want to be a real structure or a manufacturer that will invest in our sport because they do believe in the technological platform that the F1 can provide to their system. So very, very happy that now this is on board, moving forward and looking forward to see them on the track, together with the other teams to fight for a great championship.

Kutgun Maral, Evercore ISI.

If I could. First, on sponsorship. I know 2025 will already be very robust given the partnerships that you've already inked. And it doesn't seem like the team has stopped either with at least an all-in deal and bringing on Tag Heur as a tile partner for Monaco. I guess looking ahead, do you see even more opportunities as you look to the balance of this year?

Or are you largely set for 2025 based on the pipeline. And given the tenor of your conversations, is there anything you can share about how sponsorship could look like in 2026 as well? And then I have a follow-up on GM Cadillac.

Stefano Domenicali

As we said, we are very robust with regard to the pipeline of 2025 because basically, in terms of achievements. The entry of the robust partnership that we have announced has been, I would say, impressive, impressive with regard to the quality of the brand and of course, not only about the quality, but the investment they are bringing to us.

What for me is relevant is that this new partnership has broken and will protein, new way of activating the partnership. It's not only visibility, it's not only awareness, it's all what is behind that. And now everyone is working together to make sure that this platform will offer to their needs in terms of business development, what we can offer to them.

So that is an important assessment that we have done together. We will see already with facts.

With regard to the other possibility, what we lived and we don't have to forget where we were just a couple of years ago. we have moved not only in terms of quantity but also in quality of partnership for us was the need now to restructure the category in order to make sure there was the possibility to develop regional deals or to uplift as we did from official to global partners.

And of course, there are different possibilities to maximize it through the digitalization that can be applied to our presentation, our products on TV and not only on TV on the track. And on top of that, of course, the fan engagement that we are bringing with new partners is pushing us to move -- and this is the reason why, for example, what's more Vegas was important to create different opportunity with the hospitality packages and hospitality and experience that we are offering to our friends.

Looking ahead, I would say the pipeline already for the next year is very strong, and that's what we need to do. Work together. And if we work well, the activation program that we are activating with them, with facts is showing that our strategy is right. Otherwise, it wouldn't be in such a good position. And I do believe that this position will keep going like that even in the future.

Kutgun Maral

That's very helpful. And then maybe if I could just follow up on the GM Cadillac discussion. There have been some questions on what this could mean for the Concorde agreement discussions and ultimately, what it does to the splits and economics that the teams are pushing for?

I know that there's not much you can share on the concord right now, but how should we think about the financial impact of welcoming GM Cadillac to the grid. And is the hope that the long-term top line opportunity through sponsorship and maybe media rights would offset any margin pressure? Or is it just wrong to even assume that there would be margin degradation?

Stefano Domenicali

With regard to the first question, there's no impact at all with the current discussion of the Concorde Agreement. That's been -- as you know, Concored is done by two major elements. One is the financial one that is related to the commercialization and the marketing side of it that discussion between us and the teams, and we are in a good position on that.

The other topic or the other part of it is the governance that, of course, we need to work together with the FIA and the teams. And on that, we are working in order to respect the date, as you know, there's no time pressure on that because we are all working as partners, and we want to find the best solution for the store.

And this is something that we're going to do, even with one more time together into the future because, of course, Cadillac will be part of it. and will have a voice as the others into the future.

Then with regard to the fact that Cadillac will bring a new US branch, I think that we can bring opportunities. And I'm totally positive because the sport is growing in such a magnitude that everyone will exploit the best out of it. And I'm sure that the Cadillac GM Group will benefit from being part of this group.

Derek Chang

Can I just add -- thanks, Stefan, that in my early days here, I have had the opportunity to meet with some of the teams, certainly over the last month or so. And Look, I don't think -- I think the relationship between Formula One and the teams has never been stronger.

We heard a lot of good positive affirmation of that in terms of what Liberty has done since we acquired F1, and I think people really are excited about the future and growing the overall pie in terms of the economics of what the sport can deliver.

I think very specifically on the Concorde agreement and our splits with the teams already remarked on the fact that hopefully, we get the Concorde agreement done soon. At this point, the entry of a 11 team has not really impacted that discussion per se.

And if you think about it, it doesn't impact the split between us and the team that it certainly is an 11 team in terms of the allocations amongst those that team themselves. But Again, I think with the entry of a group like GM, the hope and thought here is that we continue to grow the overall pie for Formula One and the Formula One ecosystem.

Jeffrey Wlodarczak

First of all, congrats, Eric on the new position. I had a couple related to Formula One. I guess a follow-up on the Concorde Agreement. So I mean, should we expect that's going to be pretty similar to the current deal? Or can you make changes that really help move this work forward.

I guess, Stefano, on the 2026 powertrains, you talk to the team as they develop that. Are there any major surprises, positive or at that you're seeing on development?

Stefano Domenicali

I didn't get the second question properly, to be honest. The first related to Concored I think that it's worth to say without saying anything that we can say so far is the basic fundamentals are quite similar to the actual structure.

That is definitely the way that we are working on and the way we are progressing with that. The second one, I heard something related to the 2026 cars, Jeffrey, if you can repeat because the line was not great. Sorry for that.

Jeffrey Wlodarczak

Yes. No worries. Hopefully, you can hear me now. I was just wondering if there were any major surprises on the development of those 26 powertrains that you've heard from the team on the positive or negative?

Stefano Domenicali

Yes, thank you nester much. I think that, as always, when there is a change of regulation, there is a lot of things that are related to is working the best. Who knows or has been able to maximize the performance out of the regulation that is totally new.

So a lot of expectation, and it is normal that a part of the ecosystem at that stage is trying to say why we are changing the things in a moment where the champions is so competitive. That has been always the case in the cycle of Formal One.

I do believe that the fact that now with regard to the technological development, we put on the sense of the sustainable fuel is something that will give the future boost of a different thinking of technological implication of the future in formal one. That's one pretty convinced about it.

We need to keep at the center to show the fact that the driver needs to be at the center of the stage and the technological choices for the future needs to be relevant for that. We need to keep that clearly, because it is relevant to say that our fan base is shifted in terms of interest.

And we need to have the duty to make sure there is the right balance between the, let's say, the so-called traditional fans versus the new fans. And that's the focus that we want to keep together.

Bryan Kraft, Deutsche Bank. Bryan, are you able to check up yourself muted, please? Stephen Laszczyk, Goldman Sachs.

Stephen Laszczyk

Two, if I could. First, on the media rights opportunity internationally for Stefano and Derek, if you want to jump in on this one. I'm curious if there's anything you've learned so far through your US media rights negotiation that has made you more or less optimistic on the man backdrop for media rights for F1 more globally?

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, even. I mean, from my side, I see that as a month of a great opportunity to exploit the maximum out of it. I'm not really worried about that. because I do believe that it's potentially -- not potentially, actually, we have a growing fan base and we need to make sure we find the right product and the right partner in order to engage with them. and that's really conclusion.

One thing that we need to -- we don't have to forget that this part of the equation is our F1 TV product. because it's something that it is relevant. It is really an incredible tool of engagement. And this is something that we want to keep that inside the discussion of whoever will be the partner of the future because we believe of the value we truly believe of the value of this platform.

Derek Chang

I would say that the -- I'm not so sure the US rights is correlated to -- what we learned to this experience is necessarily correlated to other markets per se because each of them have their own individual characteristics, both in terms of demand as well as players in the market.

I would say that one thing that is obviously transpired over the last several years as some of the large streaming platforms have gotten engaged in sports is a demand on their part for worldwide rights for lack of a better term. And hopefully, that will certainly drive some of the demand as we look around the globe.

If you see the -- one of the big selling points of the Netflix taking on the NFL Christmas games was that they delivered those globally. So this is clearly an evolving space that we'll keep an eye on.

Stephen Laszczyk

Got it. And then a second question just on Vegas for Brian. I appreciate you're not commenting on very specific economics.

But I was just curious if there's anything you can give us on the magnitude of the decline year over year in revenue and profit at the rate just given the focus at the moment the market that could maybe give us confidence that some of the underperformance in the quarter was isolated to Vegas specifically and maybe not more broadly throughout the F1 core business.

Brian Wendling

Yes, thanks. We can't comment on the specifics, but the majority of the miss that you guys are calculating based on the team payment was Vegas related.

Operator

Bryan Kraft, Deutsche Bank.

Bryan Kraft

Okay. Great. Welcome, Derek, and congratulations. I had two questions. So first, on the heels of several high-profile race promotion renewals, how did the results of those renewals line up with your expectations that race promotion is increasingly becoming a revenue growth opportunity.

And then the second one is -- I know you don't want to give guidance, but could you just talk broadly about the media rights revenue outlook in 2025 relative to 2024? It seems like growth in that line should accelerate this year. I would appreciate any color there. Thank you.

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, Brian. I mean, rate promotion. As you know, we have let's say, we have taken the decision to be strong and long-term agreement with a place where we do believe is relevant to state focus on working together because there is a possibility to increase even other revenue stream through this relationship.

The other thing is, of course, every promoter is innovating is investing. And I remember very well when I had my first earnings call, there were a lot of doubts that this revenue stream would be able to grow because there was a lot of thinking that, that was not possible.

Actually, we've proven the other way around. And I do believe that due to the tension -- positive tension of the market because we want -- a lot of countries was to host the Grand Prix.

And everyone was to basically show that they are committed to long term there is the possibility to keep growing this rest revenue stream. This is our focus. Of course, what is good is that we -- everyone has now the focus on the fence who attended the race.

So everyone has to improve the different segmentation that the fans requires in terms of GA, in terms of medium hospitality, higher profile hospitality working the marginality, of course, working on the experience of the fans together with the promotion.

So on that respect, I do believe the expectation, even if we are not giving any guidelines on that are in the direction of being very strong even in the future. With regard to the media right, if I may say direct, I would say on that, the wave of the package. And if you have a good sport, if you have a good fan base, the media rights should keep growing in that respect.

And I do believe that what is important for the future is to see how the face wants to capture the content we are producing. And there will be not only the so-called traditional media right, but there are other platforms that will have a big effect on not only growing that, but also growing the different possibility of engaging with the fans.

And this is for me, in our opinion, very, very peculiar to the fact that this is relevant to the growth in that landscape.

Brian Wendling

I'd just add, Bryan, specifically on' '25 versus '24 for media rights, you're largely going to be seeing just regular uplifts and standard renewals. We would expect continued growth in F1 TV, and we're launching our new premium F1 TV product too. So those will be the primary drivers in '25.

Bryan Kraft

It's similar in strength as last year from a growth perspective? Or would you expect any acceleration this year, Brian?

Brian Wendling

I'll leave it at what we've answered already, Bryan.

Operator

Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo.

Steven Cahall

So first, just on media rights and with the expansion of premium F1 TV, can you just help us conceptualize how that product fits into the discussions that you have with some of the larger streaming companies. I guess the expectation is that those streaming companies probably don't want to see a competing streaming product in market, even if it's your own.

So how do you manage those dynamics as you look to maximize the value of what you can get for rights. And then just one on Concord and maybe Concored dynamics. I think the last Concorde had a big overhang from what was going on with the pandemic and maybe the team's expectation or need to limit some of their downside risk.

You've grown the sport a lot since then. The teams have also added a lot to their calendar, both with media and with races. So how do you think team dynamics are this time? What do you think their expectations are? And do you think that they have any feelings about your ability to hold team payments flat and would be willing to accept that?

Stefano Domenicali

Thanks, Steven. I mean with regard to the, let's say, the value of the premium F1 TV or Pro, we are doing in terms of different propositions. As we said, we believe that this has to be considered an added value. And we found solutions. I'll give you one example in a collaboration with [ Viaplay ] in the Dutch market, we were able to find a solution that has integrated that in the package.

So I do believe that we are flexible to understand what will be the need of our future broadcaster, knowing that has a value because it's an incredible package. And the extended -- and the different packs that we are offering allows all our fans to be connected with our world. And I do believe this is relevant also and this element has to be considered in our negotiation with future partner.

Concored. I mean, the team dynamics, I would say everyone recognized huge growth of the business. I mean it's not only related to the fact that there is a lot of interest on eventually buying things because we see the potential value of them. You see from the numbers and the quality of partners that are connected to each team. That means that everyone recognized the shoes all we are doing together.

And the dynamics are very constructive. It's part of the game that everyone wants to try to squeeze or maximize what they can bring home. That's part of the game. But I would say the credibility that we have found that we have now together has allowed us to find the right balance. So happy to progress with this relation because that's the key point of the future and very stable growth of the business together.

Just on the Concord, the one aspect that you were asking about, we wouldn't expect to see degradation. We feel good with our relationship with the teams. So we would expect, at a minimum, we'd be in a similar place on the next agreement to where we finish out 2025.

Okay. I was interested in terms of the broadcast rights. There's been a lot of focus on the US as a solitary market, but there's rights that seem to be potentially up for renewal across the Americas, maybe even elsewhere in Japan.

Are we in a place now where it could be more interesting perhaps to get closer with some of the global streamers to negotiate large regional packages, not exactly global, but large regions that go just beyond like the US, sorry if you could discuss that.

Derek Chang

I think that the -- I think, again, what we said, and I don't mean to keep repeating it, but it's an evolving situation in terms of what the media rights landscape looks like globally what the different players out there want and want to try to achieve with their own platforms, I think, clearly, the large streamers have consistently said that they want global rights to everything.

That may or may not be possible that on a regional basis, similarly. It depends on how you define these various regions. But I do think that if some of these players are strong across the region, then clearly, there could be benefit. And I think we do have some regional deals in play.

We've got -- I know we've got some deals with [ Bison ] in various countries for instance, obviously, Sky, we've got across multiple countries in Europe. So you -- it really depends on what their strength is and what their aspirations are in some market because the sum of all of those is greater than us going out individually, then we would have to look at that and pursue those opportunity seriously.

And I think with that, I appreciate everyone's time today. I appreciate everyone listening in, and all the warm welcome and look forward to seeing more of everyone on future earnings calls. And thank you again.

Is Formula One Group (FWONK) Among Warren Buffett’s Growth Stock Picks?,"We recently published a list of Growth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Warren Buffett. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Formula One Group (NASDAQ:FWONK) stands against other growth stock picks by Warren Buffett.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been a beacon for value investors looking for high-quality businesses with long-term competitive advantages. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire six decades ago, the appropriately named “Oracle of Omaha” has outperformed the broader market.

As we approach 2025, some of Berkshire’s assets stand out as promising opportunities, combining excellent fundamentals with acceptable values despite the market’s sustained emphasis on technology and growth stocks.

Berkshire’s CEO is a strong believer in portfolio concentration. Buffett’s investment strategy revolves around choosing companies with significant competitive advantages, effective management teams, and the potential to create regular free cash flow. His concept focuses on buying exceptional firms at acceptable costs rather than inferior enterprises at low rates. This strategy has proven successful across numerous market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway providing compound yearly returns significantly higher than market averages over several decades.

The “Oracle of Omaha” concentrates on companies he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models with uncertain earnings potential. He looks for companies with pricing power, great brand awareness, and the ability to preserve or grow market share even during economic downturns. Buffett’s conservative yet effective approach has helped him become one of history’s most successful investors.

Following the filing of Berkshire’s 13F on February 14, we now know that 60% ($180 billion) of Buffett’s $299 billion portfolio is concentrated in just four magnificent stocks.

Japanese stock investors are attentively watching Buffett’s letter in the hopes of gaining information that may affect the country’s trading houses. Buffett has previously approved Japanese trading companies, resulting in increased stock value. Market participants will examine his comments for clues about the future of these companies, particularly as they are impacted by decreasing energy prices and pressure from the US government to reduce oil expenses.

As usual, Buffett’s shareholder letter is expected to provide significant insights not only into Berkshire Hathaway’s performance but also into market trends.

Investing in Atlanta Braves Holdings (NASDAQ:BATR.K) three years ago would have delivered you a 46% gain,"By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BATR.K), which is up 46%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 27% (not including dividends).

So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.

View our latest analysis for Atlanta Braves Holdings

Given that Atlanta Braves Holdings didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings.

In the last 3 years Atlanta Braves Holdings saw its revenue grow at 7.4% per year. Considering the company is losing money, we think that rate of revenue growth is uninspiring. In that time the share price is up 14% per year, which is not unreasonable given the revenue growth. The real question is when the business will generate profits, and how quickly they will grow. Given the market doesn't seem too excited about the stock, a closer look at the financial data could pay off, if you can find indications of a stronger growth trend in the future.

A Different Perspective

Atlanta Braves Holdings shareholders are down 5.7% for the year, but the market itself is up 27%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

Promising Genomics & Synthetic Biology Stocks to Consider in 2025,"Genomics encompasses the study of a complete set of genes, their work process, and their way of interacting with each other and the environment. While it incorporates elements of genetics, the primary focus is on characterizing all the genes of an organism, rather than individual genes.

The evolution of genomics in the last couple of decades to decode diseases has ushered in a revolutionary era in genetic medicine. There have been several breakthroughs in this field, attracting the attention of pharma and biotech companies. Of late, genomic information is being used to evaluate individual responses to drugs and facilitate the development of targeted therapies.

Interestingly, genomics has paved the way for innovative concepts like synthetic biology, which applies engineering principles to biology. Synthetic biology products serve life sciences researchers across a variety of healthcare applications, including drug discovery, disease detection, enzyme engineering, gene editing and basic academic research.

Given the constant need for innovative medical treatments, genomics holds the key to the future of the medical world. The recent spotlight on companies in the evolving genomics sector can be attributed to a drastic reduction in cost, accuracy and time to map an individual’s entire genome.

A major player in this field is Illumina ILMN, a global leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic and genomic analysis. While some companies are using genetic sequencing to develop solutions not just for healthcare, but also for other areas, diagnostic companies use sequencing data to identify specific genetic variations and map them to a known condition. Another breakthrough is the development of genome editing approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Gene editing companies, such as BEAM Therapeutics BEAM and Intellia Therapeutics NTLA, hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA.

Per estimates, the genomics market will reach $157.47 billion by 2033. Per Grandview research, the global synthetic biology market size was valued at $16.22 billion in 2024 and is projected to witness a CAGR of 17.30% from 2025 to 2030.

If you're looking to capitalize on this trend, our Genomics and Synthetic Biology screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks at any given time. Investors should consider adding stocks like Twist Bioscience Corporation TWST, Wave Life Sciences WVE and CRISPR Therapeutics AG CRSP to their portfolio.",2025-03-28 13:39:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/promising-genomics-synthetic-biology-stocks-133900631.html,Yahoo Finance
"Wave Life Sciences unveils Phase II data for DMD therapy, WVE-N531","The trial recruited 11 boys, between the ages of five and eleven, amenable to exon 53 skipping only one of whom was non-ambulatory. Credit: Shutterstock / eyes on him

Wave Life Sciences’ Phase II open-label trial investigating its disease-modifying drug for boys living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), WVE-N531, has met all trial endpoints, showing the drug led to significant improvements in muscle health.

Results from the Forward-53 trial (NCT04906460) show the exon-skipping oligonucleotide-based therapy improved muscle health by the end of week 48 including a decline in necrosis and inflammation.

The trial recruited 11 boys, between the ages of five and 11, amenable to exon 53 skipping only one of whom was non-ambulatory. Typically, DMD develops due to a lack of the protein dystrophin, which helps to protect muscle cells. Results from the Phase II trial saw dystrophin expression stabilised between 24 and 48 weeks, averaging a 7.8% increase.

At the same time, results saw a 50% decrease in serum creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme released into the bloodstream because of muscle damage. Alongside those results, WVE-N531 was able to elicit a 3.8-second difference in TTR versus a natural history of matched untreated patients, using the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) system.

Based on US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) feedback, the company said it is planning a 2026 New Drug Application (NDA) for WVE-N531’s accelerated approval.

Laurent Servais, principal investigator in the Forward-53 trial said: “As a clinician deeply involved in patient care and research in muscle diseases like DMD, I am encouraged by these data for WVE-N531 that show dystrophin restoration and several markers of improved muscle condition.

“To see a clinically meaningful and statistically significant difference in TTR versus natural history in a Phase II study is another encouraging finding. I am looking forward to the continued development of WVE-N531.”

The process of exon skipping involves using small, synthetic DNA molecules called antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to skip specific sections of DNA, known as exons, during the process of RNA splicing, causing the body to produce more dystrophin. One of the few other therapeutics focused on exon 53 skipping is NS Pharma’s Viltepso.

At present, the market for DMD therapies is largely driven by Sarepta Therapeutic’s Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) and Santhera Pharmaceuticals’ Agamree (vamorolone), with research by GlobalData estimating that across the seven major markets (7MM: US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and Japan), DMD treatments are expected to grow from sales of $2.3bn in 2023 to $5.2bn by 2033.

If approved for DMD, WVE-N531 could bring in as much as $243m for Wave Life Sciences by the end of 2030.

GlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.

Wave Life Sciences (WVE) Stock Jumps 6.1%: Will It Continue to Soar?,"Wave Life Sciences (WVE) shares ended the last trading session 6.1% higher at $10.02. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 8.9% loss over the past four weeks.

The stock rallied after the company announced positive data from the phase II FORWARD-53 study, which evaluated its pipeline candidate, WVE-N531, for treating boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. The study achieved all its goals by demonstrating sustained and industry-leading exon skipping, muscle concentrations, and dystrophin restoration through 48 weeks, along with a 61-day tissue half-life that supports monthly dosing of WVE-N531. Treatment with WVE-N531 was safe and well-tolerated.

This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.3%. Revenues are expected to be $13.26 million, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.

While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For Wave Life Sciences, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on WVE going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.

Wave to seek approval of Duchenne drug after mid-stage study data,"Dive Brief:

Wave Life Sciences is preparing to seek Food and Drug Administration approval of its therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy after claiming success in a Phase 2 study.

After discussions with FDA officials, the company now plans to file an application next year seeking accelerated approval of WVE-N531, with potential monthly dosing, Wave said Wednesday. The company’s shares rose by about 5% in early trading.

Although small, the Phase 2 trial showed that a so-called exon-skipping therapy can result in “substantial improvements” in muscle health, Wave said. WVE-N531 led to increased expression of dystrophin, a critical muscle protein that is either lacking or defective in Duchenne patients.

Dive Insight:

Exons are specific segments of the genetic code that encode proteins. Mutations can disrupt the process and cancel the production of the protein. Duchenne therapies like WVE-N531 aim to bypass a specific mutated exon — in this case exon 53 — in order to get production of dystrophin protein, in slightly different form, back on track.

The new data suggest WVE-N531 could be a “best-in-class” option for the roughly 8% to 10% of Duchenne patients with a genetic mutation that makes them amenable to exon 53 skipping, Jefferies analyst Roger Song wrote in a note to clients. The study’s finding that the treatment was safe and well-tolerated through 48 weeks is also key, he said.

Currently, there are two FDA-approved treatments that target exon 53: Sarepta’s Vyondys 53 and NS Pharma’s Viltepso. Both won approval based on their effects on dystrophin production — clearances contingent on follow-up studies confirming their clinical benefits for patients. NS Pharma’s initial confirmatory research failed last year, though the drug remains on the market. Sarepta’s trial is ongoing.

Wave’s Phase 2 study, known as Forward-53, only included 11 patients and compared functional test results against historical data, so it’s not the typical placebo-controlled large study that the FDA relies on to clear major therapies. But in the case of rare diseases like Duchenne, the agency allows other paths to approval.

In recent discussions, FDA officials confirmed companies can still use dystrophin expression to serve as a surrogate endpoint and win accelerated approval, Wave said Wednesday. The company also touted the functional results it saw — including a statistically significant improvement versus historical controls in “time to rise.” However, the difference between groups in a test of motor skills called the North Star Ambulatory Assessment was not significant.

The company plans to keep sharing data from Forward-53 and additional research that would support monthly dosing. It also plans to engage the FDA in a planned confirmatory trial, Wave said.",2025-03-26 11:25:55,https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/wave-duchenne-exon-53-study-data-approval-application/743583/,Yahoo Finance
Adma Biologics (ADMA) Surges 10.2%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains?,"Adma Biologics (ADMA) shares soared 10.2% in the last trading session to close at $20.61. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 15.7% gain over the past four weeks.

The sudden soaring of the stock price can be attributed to a positive investor mindset regarding the continued sales growth of ADMA Biologics’ three FDA-approved products, namely – Bivigam (to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency), Asceniv (to treat primary immunodeficiency disease or PIDD) and Nabi-HB (to treat and provide enhanced immunity against the hepatitis B virus). In 2024, the company recorded total revenues of $426.5 million entirely from product sales, representing an increase of 65% on a year-over-year basis.

This infectious disease drug developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +100%. Revenues are expected to be $119.1 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.

For Adma Biologics, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on ADMA going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.

Positive Points

WAVE Life Sciences Ltd (NASDAQ:WVE) announced positive data supporting their AATD, DMD, and HD clinical programs, demonstrating progress in RNA medicines.

The company has advanced WVE-007, their GalNAc-AIMer for obesity, to the clinic, with potential to address limitations of current weight loss therapeutics.

WVE-006 has shown potential as the first treatment for AATD addressing the root cause of the disease with a convenient subcutaneous dose.

The company has a robust pipeline with novel programs targeting both hepatic and extrahepatic targets, potentially addressing millions of patients.

WAVE Life Sciences Ltd (NASDAQ:WVE) reported a significant increase in revenue for Q4 2024, driven by recognition of deferred revenue under their Decata collaboration.

Negative Points

Research and development expenses increased significantly, primarily due to spending on the INHBE, AATD, and DMD programs.

The company reported a net loss for the full year 2024, despite a net income in Q4, indicating ongoing financial challenges.

There are uncertainties and risks associated with the forward-looking statements and clinical trial outcomes.

The company has not yet provided detailed pharmacoeconomic analysis or pricing strategies for their therapies.

The efficacy and safety of higher doses in RNA editing programs remain to be fully established, posing potential risks.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you provide more information on the expected protein levels at baseline for WVE-006 in the AATD trial? A: Paul Bolno, President and CEO, explained that the baseline was below the lower limit of detection. The focus should be on M protein levels, as ZZ patients do not produce any MAAT protein. Tracking M protein levels is crucial for understanding the therapeutic impact and editing efficiency.

Q: Regarding WVE-007, how will DEXA scanning be used to assess changes in muscle mass and weight loss? A: Paul Bolno stated that DEXA scans will help replicate preclinical findings where weight loss was primarily from fat, not muscle. The scans will be used as biomarkers to evaluate sustainable weight loss, although specific intervals for scans were not disclosed.",2025-03-05 07:05:03,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wave-life-sciences-ltd-wve-070503784.html,Yahoo Finance

Will Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (FHTX) Report Negative Q4 Earnings? What You Should Know,"The market expects Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. (FHTX) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +49.1%.

Revenues are expected to be $11.72 million, up 103.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",2025-02-27 15:00:25,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foghorn-therapeutics-inc-fhtx-report-150025028.html,Yahoo Finance
"Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) Annual Results: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year","Investors in Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.6% to close at US$48.12 following the release of its full-year results. Qifu Technology reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of CN¥17b and statutory earnings per share of CN¥41.28, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.

This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.

NasdaqGS:QFIN Earnings and Revenue Growth March 28th 2025

Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Qifu Technology from ten analysts is for revenues of CN¥17.9b in 2025. If met, it would imply an okay 4.1% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to step up 11% to CN¥49.77. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of CN¥17.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of CN¥48.90 in 2025. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.

View our latest analysis for Qifu Technology

There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$54.40, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Qifu Technology, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$59.69 and the most bearish at US$49.90 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Qifu Technology is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.

Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that Qifu Technology's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 8.4% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 11% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Qifu Technology.",2025-03-28 11:41:53,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qifu-technology-inc-nasdaq-qfin-114153178.html,Yahoo Finance
Why Qifu Technology Inc. (QFIN) Is Skyrocketing?,"We recently published a list of 10 Stocks Outperform Broader Market on Wednesday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Qifu Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) stands against other stocks that outperform broader market on Wednesday.

The stock market finished in the red territory on Wednesday as investors sold off positions to mitigate risks from a fresh round of tariffs due in the next few days.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell the hardest, down 2.04 percent, followed by the S&P 500, down 1.12 percent. The Dow Jones declined by 0.31 percent.

According to President Donald Trump, all cars made outside of the US would be slapped with a 25-percent tariff beginning April 2.

Meanwhile, let us take a look at the 10 companies across mixed sectors that defied a broader market downturn, having registered modest to strong gains during the trading session.

To come up with the list, we considered only the stocks with $2 billion market capitalization and $5 million in trading volume.

Why Qifu Technology Inc. (QFIN) Is Skyrocketing?

A close-up of a loan contract being signed with a satisfied customer.

Qifu Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN)

Qifu Technology rallied by 4.84 percent on Wednesday to close at $46.37 each after Bank of America upgraded its stock rating for the company.

On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Emma Xu raised the price target for QFIN to $52.70 from $50.66 previously and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The price target represented a 13.6-percent upside from QFIN’s closing price on Wednesday.

The initial conversion rate for the notes was set at 16.7475 American Depositary Shares for every $1,000 of principal, corresponding to an initial conversion price of $59.71 per ADS.

According to the company, proceeds from the notes will be used to fund its buyback program.

Overall, QFIN ranks 5th on our list of stocks that outperform broader market on Wednesday. While we acknowledge the potential of QFIN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Qifu Technology (NASDAQ:QFIN) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,"Qifu Technology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QFIN) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to CN¥0.69 on 2nd of June. This takes the dividend yield to 3.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with.

This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.

Qifu Technology's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage

While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Qifu Technology's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.

Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 44.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 3.1% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.

NasdaqGS:QFIN Historic Dividend March 25th 2025

Check out our latest analysis for Qifu Technology

Qifu Technology's Dividend Has Lacked Consistency

Looking back, the company hasn't been paying the most consistent dividend, but with such a short dividend history it could be too early to draw solid conclusions. The annual payment during the last 3 years was CN¥7.07 in 2022, and the most recent fiscal year payment was CN¥10.12. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Qifu Technology has impressed us by growing EPS at 18% per year over the past five years. Qifu Technology definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.

We Really Like Qifu Technology's Dividend

Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Qifu Technology is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Qifu Technology that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

"Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN): Among the Best Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires","We recently published a list of the 10 Best Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) stands against the other Chinese stocks held by billionaires.

The People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) monetary easing and government stimulus have lifted the valuations of Chinese equities. A few months ago, many investors were expecting the U.S. economy to be in a better position and Chinese stocks were facing significant regulatory worries. However, the tables have turned with the Chinese economy expected to be in a better position compared to 2024.

A Positive Outlook for China

Things have taken a wild turn with the U.S. president imposing high tariffs and investors expecting an economic slowdown in the U.S. On the other hand, China’s advancement in AI and its capabilities to grow its AI infrastructure have intensified since the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model.

“The U.S. has had a good period, and that’s coming to an end because Trump’s policies are very anti-economy. China has had a very bad period, but it looks as if it’s starting to recover,” Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told CNBC.

Chinese government support for its technology sector has induced much optimism among investors. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of the largest Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, has soared over 21% year-to-date, as of March 25. At the same time, the NASDAQ 100 index, covering the U.S. tech stocks, has plunged over 3.70%. Whereas, the Shanghai Composite Index has risen over 3% compared to a drop of 1.70% in the S&P 500 index.

“Performance of the HSCEI/MSCI China in the past 17 months trended closely to the trajectory a decade ago, making us worry that we might be approaching some correction soon,” analysts at the Bank of America wrote in a report published on March 17.

Harris believes that China’s A shares have been quite depressed for some time compared to the U.S. stocks. With valuation improvements and optimism in the tech sector in China, it is a good time to explore Chinese stocks.

Our Methodology

To compile our list of the best Chinese stocks to buy according to billionaires, we looked for the Chinese stocks widely held by billionaires. Data for the number of billionaire investors for each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database, updated as of Q4 2024. Finally, the 10 best Chinese stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaires holding stakes in them. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds that held these stocks as of Q4 2024.",2025-03-25 13:00:06,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qifu-technology-inc-nasdaq-qfin-130006568.html,Yahoo Finance
"With EPS Growth And More, Qifu Technology (NASDAQ:QFIN) Makes An Interesting Case","It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.

Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Qifu Technology (NASDAQ:QFIN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.

Check out our latest analysis for Qifu Technology

Qifu Technology's Improving Profits

Even modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So it's no surprise that some investors are more inclined to invest in profitable businesses. To the delight of shareholders, Qifu Technology's EPS soared from CN¥26.72 to CN¥40.35, over the last year. That's a fantastic gain of 51%.

Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that Qifu Technology's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Qifu Technology maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 5.4% to CN¥17b. That's a real positive.

Are Qifu Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Since Qifu Technology has a market capitalisation of US$6.7b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth CN¥928m. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.

Qifu Technology Inc (QFIN) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Highlights: Record Net Income and Strategic Shifts,"Q : Could management discuss the integration of AI, particularly Deepseek, and the potential efficiency gains? Also, is there any recovery in credit demand following recent policy support? A : AI, especially Deepseek, is crucial for us, given the strong data foundation in the credit industry. We've implemented AI in sales, loan collection, and marketing, with significant efficiency improvements. For instance, our Capella system, used by 84% of our collection team, enhances communication strategies. We plan to expand AI applications in credit assessment and risk decision-making. Regarding credit demand, we observed a 10% increase in loan applications in Q4 compared to Q3, with a seasonal pickup in January. We expect Q1 loan volume to grow over 10% year-over-year, though we remain cautious about macro recovery.

The company faces interest rate uncertainty, which could impact funding costs and overall financial performance.

Funding costs are approaching the bottom line of financial institutions, indicating limited room for further decline.

The company experienced a slight increase in day 1 delinquency rate and collection rate due to changes in repayment reminder strategies.

Despite strong on-balance sheet loans, there was a year-on-year decline in revenue from credit-driven service capital heavy due to a significant decline in off-balance sheet loans.

Qifu Technology Inc ( NASDAQ:QFIN ) enhanced user acquisition efficiency, with a 16.2% year-over-year increase in new borrowers and a 5.3% decline in average acquisition cost per credit line user.

Story Continues

Q: What drove the changes in early delinquency metrics in Q4, and what's the outlook for net take rate? A: (Yan Zheng, Chief Risk Officer) The slight increase in day-one delinquency and collection rates was due to optimizing our repayment reminder strategy, reducing early reminders by 13% to enhance user experience without affecting loss rates. Our risk levels remain stable. (Alex Xu, CFO) Our take rate improved steadily in 2024, reaching nearly 6% in Q4. We aim to maintain a take rate slightly above 5% for 2025, with room to test new strategies for incremental profitability.

Q: How will recent regulatory changes promoting consumer finance impact the industry and Qifu Technology? A: The new policy signals strong government support for boosting consumption through consumer credit. It suggests increased loan supply, flexible terms for financial institutions, and consumer protection. We expect a stable regulatory environment, allowing us to innovate and better serve customers.

Q: Is your funding cost continuing to decline, and what is the lowest level it can reach? A: Our funding costs have declined faster than LPR due to risk cuts and demand-supply dynamics. However, further declines are limited as current costs approach financial institutions' bottom lines. We plan to issue more ABS to optimize funding structure, potentially reducing overall costs slightly.

Q: How does Qifu Technology plan to deliver shareholder value, and what is the outlook for future growth? A: (Alex Xu, CFO) We are committed to shareholder returns, with a 70%-plus payout ratio target. Our focus is on share buybacks, with a $450 million program underway. We aim to increase dividends per share semiannually, supported by share base reduction. Long-term, we may adjust the mix between buybacks and dividends.

"Is Qifu Technology, Inc. (QFIN) the Cheap Chinese Stock to Buy Now?","We recently published a list of 10 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) stands against other cheap Chinese stocks to buy now.

Chinese Market Outlook 2025

On February 12, Russell Investment released its Chinese market outlook for 2025. The investment firm noted that the outlook for China in 2025 is marked by several key factors, including the potential for new stimulus measures, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the impact of US tariffs on Chinese exports. Investors are closely watching whether the Chinese government will implement additional economic support measures, similar to those seen in 2024. This year, however, the landscape is complicated by the introduction of the DeepSeek AI model and the imposition of US tariffs on Chinese goods.

As per the report, the property sector remains a significant drag factor to China’s economy, with developers facing pressure and consumers cautious about purchasing property. Despite this, there are tentative signs of improvement in secondary home transactions, suggesting that supportive measures from 2024 may be starting to take effect. However, consumer confidence remains low, nearing the lows of the past four years. Moreover, the economy is also at risk of deflation, which could lead consumers to delay major purchases in anticipation of further price drops.

Russell Investment further noted that the National People’s Congress meeting in March will be crucial, as it will announce the economic growth target for the year and any new policy measures. If a growth target of around 4.5% is set, substantial stimulus measures may be required to achieve it. The United States has imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which China has responded to by placing tariffs on $14 billion worth of US goods. These tariffs are expected to reduce China’s GDP growth by about 0.3 percentage points.

On the bright side, China has seen significant advancements in AI, with companies like DeepSeek achieving notable gains. However, the export embargo on major chip manufacturers by the US poses a challenge to further AI development in China. The focus is likely to shift towards efficiency improvements in AI capabilities. Russell Investments views the outlook for Chinese equities as marginally positive. This assessment is based on a cycle, valuation, and sentiment framework. Despite economic uncertainties, Chinese companies have improved their return on equity, and analysts expect about 9% earnings-per-share growth in 2025. Valuations for Chinese equities appear reasonable compared to other emerging markets, with forward multiples at around 10 times and a PEG ratio at the 15th percentile historically.",2025-03-07 16:24:46,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qifu-technology-inc-qfin-cheap-162446987.html,Yahoo Finance
Qifu Technology (NASDAQ:QFIN) shareholders have earned a 41% CAGR over the last five years,"We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. For example, the Qifu Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:QFIN) share price is up a whopping 380% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. On top of that, the share price is up 19% in about a quarter.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.

See our latest analysis for Qifu Technology

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

Over half a decade, Qifu Technology managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 37% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.

The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

We know that Qifu Technology has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Qifu Technology will grow revenue in the future.

What About Dividends?

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Qifu Technology the TSR over the last 5 years was 459%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that Qifu Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 204% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 41% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Qifu Technology has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.",2025-02-03 10:22:37,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qifu-technology-nasdaq-qfin-shareholders-102237896.html,Yahoo Finance

Tiny Drugmaker Soars on FDA Win to Treat Never-Ending Hunger,"(Bloomberg) -- Soleno Therapeutics jumped on Thursday after the drugmaker won US approval for its drug to treat insatiable hunger caused by a genetic disorder.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Shares of the Redwood City, California-based company climbed 38% — the biggest one-day gain since September 2023 — to their highest level in more than eight years.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Soleno’s pill to treat hyperphagia — a condition where individuals have a sense of being hungry all the time and never feeling satisfied — in adults and children four years or older. The condition is a feature of a genetic disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome — which has no cure and affects one in every 10,000 to 30,000 children, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Called Vykat XR, the drug is the first treatment to notch regulatory approval to address the extreme hunger that is associated with Prader-Willi. The regulatory win also marks a milestone for Soleno, as it is the company’s first approved drug since it went public in 2014.

Wall Street analysts cheered the approval, calling it a significant win for the stock and expecting a strong drug launch for the company. Soleno expects the pill to be available in the US starting in April.

“We think the drug’s well-positioned to launch strongly into what we see as a blockbuster opportunity,” Stifel analyst James Condulis wrote in a note to clients while also recommending investors own the stock.

Soleno wins FDA approval for Prader-Willi hyperphagia treatment,"Hyperphagia is one of the most serious and defining characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome. Credit: Catherine Falls Commercial via Getty Images.

Soleno Therapeutics has won US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for diazoxide choline – which will be branded as Vykat XR – to treat extreme hunger in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.

This approval follows a three-month delay from the FDA. In November 2024, the agency classified responses from Soleno as a “major amendment” to its new drug application (NDA), requiring additional time to review. However, the agency did not raise concerns about the drug’s safety, efficacy, or manufacturing.

Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by abnormalities in chromosome 15. Symptoms include low muscle tone, developmental delays, and behavioural challenges. Extreme hunger – known as hyperphagia, is one of the most serious and defining characteristics of the disorder and can lead to severe obesity and associated health complications if unmanaged. Vykat XR is now the only FDA-approved treatment specifically addressing hyperphagia in Prader-Willi syndrome.

The FDA approval of Vykat XR was based on data from the Phase III Study C602-RWP clinical trial (NCT03714373). Efficacy was demonstrated during a 16-week randomised withdrawal study period. Patients who switched to a placebo demonstrated a statistically significant worsening of hyperphagia compared to those who remained on Vykat XR.

The drug was also studied in the Phase III DESTINY-PWS trial (NCT03440814), which enrolled 127 individuals with genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in hyperphagia reduction overall, but Soleno reported “nominally significant” reductions in fat mass, and general improvements in condition as assessed by investigators.

Vykat XR is set to launch in the US in April 2025, according to Soleno’s 26 March announcement. Vykat XR – an extended-release tablet containing a crystalline salt formulation of diazoxide – works by activating the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel, which plays a role in hunger regulation.

The approval was welcomed by the Prader-Willi Syndrome Association: “Today marks a historic day for the PWS community. The FDA’s approval of Vykat XR represents a monumental step forward in addressing the longstanding unmet needs of individuals living with PWS and their families,” said Stacy Ward, CEO of the Association.

Soleno also has its eyes set on Europe, having announced previously that it plans to file for approval of Vykat XR in the EU in the first half of 2025.

According to GlobalData’s Pharma Intelligence Center, Vykat XR is set to generate $876m in sales by 2030.

Soleno stock skyrockets on FDA drug approval,"00:00 Speaker A

Shares of Solano Therapeutics are surging after winning US FDA approval for its new drug to treat excessive hunger and people with Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to physical, mental, and behavioral problems. Being hungry all the time is a key feature of the syndrome, and analysts say that this approval is an important catalyst for the stock. Shares are moving to the upside ripping higher by more than 40% during today's activity.

00:33 Speaker B

Yeah, you see this in the biotech world, right? Where, um, they hit and the the stock goes up. That's because Solano is a pre-revenue company. This would be their first product. So, obviously, if they get a product, that would be a big deal. The product is called Vycat, if I am saying that correctly. It is indeed to treat this syndrome, which is a relatively rare syndrome, but you get these sort of rare disease drugs that can be a big hit, um, because they are usually priced at relatively high levels. So that's something that is going to be in focus for analysts, where is this going to be priced and, um, what is that going to mean for the future revenue of the company?

01:37 Speaker A

Yeah, one of those such analysts over at Piper Sandler reaffirming their optimistic stance. They have a $93 price target on the stock. And of course, we're looking at shares just jumping as we mentioned a moment ago here, just they're still a little shy of that price target for certain here on the day.

02:04 Speaker B

Yes. Right, because maybe when they eventually actually start selling the thing and seeing revenue come in, maybe then there's analysts thinking more, um, signs for upside, more room for upside. One more thing to mention here is with this approval, it's a so-called clean label without warnings, which, um, some analysts were calling a best-case scenario where you don't want sort of warnings of dire side effects to be on the label that could limit the sales.

02:55 Speaker A

Sure. Good note. Julie, thanks so much for breaking this down.

SLNO Stock Rallies on FDA Approval of Prader-Willi Syndrome Drug,"Shares of Soleno Therapeutics SLNO have rallied 37% in the premarket hours today following the FDA approval of Vykat XR (diazoxide choline) extended-release tablets for treating hyperphagia in adults and children aged four years and older with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The company expects to launch the drug in the United States in April 2025.

Soleno’s Vykat XR, previously referred to as DCCR, is an innovative, once-daily, proprietary extended-release dosage form that contains diazoxide choline, the crystalline salt form of diazoxide. Although not approved for treating PWS, the parent molecule, diazoxide, treats a few rare diseases in neonates, infants, children and adults.

Per the PWS Association USA, approximately one in every 15,000 newborns suffers from this rare genetic disorder. The most common symptom of PWS is hyperphagia, an abnormally increased appetite for food, often leading to excessive eating, which takes a serious toll on the quality of life of patients suffering from it. In the long term, hyperphagia often leads to co-morbidities, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Year to date, shares of SLNO have gained 8.9% against the industry’s 0.8% decline.

The Basis for the FDA’s Approval of SLNO’s PWS Drug

The FDA approval of Soleno’s Vykat XR for the PWS indication was based on the success of the phase III Study C602. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant reduction in hyperphagia-related behaviors as assessed by the hyperphagia questionnaire for clinical trials score, compared to the placebo, during the 16-week randomized withdrawal study period of the late-stage study.

Study C602 also met its secondary endpoints, which showed that during the withdrawal period, the placebo group experienced strong trends of worsening symptoms in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement ratings, compared to patients who received Vykat XR.

Patients who received the drug did not report any new or unexpected side effects. It was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported.

Soleno has established extensive patent protection for the therapeutic use of Vykat XR in PWS patients. It enjoys the FDA’s Breakthrough, Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations in the United States. In the EU, the drug enjoys the Orphan Drug Designation for the same indication.

Soleno’s Competition in the Target Market

Please note that Acadia Pharmaceuticals ACAD also added a new study candidate to its rare disease portfolio, carbetocin nasal spray (ACP-101), to treat hyperphagia associated with PWS in 2023. Acadia acquired worldwide rights to develop and commercialize carbetocin nasal spray with the acquisition of Levo Therapeutics in June 2022.",2025-03-27 12:46:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slno-stock-rallies-fda-approval-124600150.html,Yahoo Finance
First Prader-Willi drug to reduce hunger approved by FDA,"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the first treatment for the insatiable hunger associated with the rare disease Prader-Willi syndrome, a long-awaited decision that follows an unorthodox pitch from the drug’s developer.

The agency on cleared Vykat XR, from biotechnology company Soleno Therapeutics, for this hyperphagia that’s caused by Prader-Willi. Treatment has specifically been approved for adults and children at least four years of age. The drug’s list price depends on a person’s weight, but would equate to about $466,000 per year based on average weight of the participants in Soleno’s Phase 3 trial, executives revealed on a conference call.

The approval is a milestone for research into a disease that’s proven difficult to target. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S. and causes multiple cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most debilitating is a hunger that can be so consuming caregivers may use locks or alarms to keep patients from accessing food or binge eating, which can cause extreme obesity, poor metabolic health and even death.

Prader-Willi is typically managed through supportive care and human growth hormone to boost muscle and lower body fat. The anti-seizure medication topiramate can also help reduce appetite and is sometimes prescribed off-label.

But until now, no other drug therapies were approved, in part because of the disease’s myriad manifestations as well as complex — and still poorly understood — genetics. Since the clearance of human growth hormone 25 years ago, every drug to reach Phase 3 testing has failed or been rejected by regulators.

The need for a new therapy led a group of experts, in a 2023 editorial published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, to call for more ""flexibility"" in the review of Prader-Willi drugs. The authors highlighted exceptions the FDA has made in clearing drugs for diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease — life-threatening illnesses with few, if any, treatments available.

“All of these factors apply to [Prader-Willi],” they wrote, arguing the “inherent rigidity” to the approval process was leading the agency to overlook drug benefits that, while not main study goals, were still “significant” for patients.

Among the medicines mentioned in that editorial was Soleno’s therapy, which has traveled an unusual path to approval. Formerly known as DCCR, the drug is an extended-release form of a molecule, diazoxide, that’s used to treat low blood sugar. It failed the primary objective of a Phase 3 trial five years ago. But Soleno claimed the COVID-19 pandemic skewed the results, arguing there were vast differences in the data collected before and after March 1, 2020 and that Vykat displayed meaningful differences on secondary measures.

Soleno collaborated with the FDA to find a workaround and came up with an unusual answer. It added a new part to the study in which patients were randomized to either continue or stop receiving Vykat and then tested for hyperphagia levels over time. The company claimed success in that evaluation in September 2023, and filed an approval application afterwards.

Since then, Soleno’s market value has surged past $2 billion amid anticipation of an approval. A delayed decision in November fueled doubt among investors. Still, multiple Wall Street analysts have been optimistic because of the lack of Prader-Willi therapies and the fact Soleno succeeded in a study the FDA endorsed.

“Although not as straightforward of an application as the division is used to seeing, we believe the strength of evidence and unmet need position Soleno for a major positive catalyst in the near term,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney wrote in a note to clients in February.

Vykat’s approval unlocks a market opportunity that analysts at the investment firm Stifel estimate is worth more than $1.5 billion annually. Hyperphagia is the “biggest burden” for Prader-Willi patients and there is “significant patient and physician enthusiasm/awareness” for Soleno’s drug, they wrote in a research note earlier this month.

Is Soleno Therapeutics (SLNO) the Top Small Cap Stock to Buy with the Highest Upside Potential?,"We recently published a list of the Top 10 Small Cap Stocks to Buy with the Highest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Soleno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLNO) stands against other top small cap stocks to buy with the highest upside potential.

What Would 2025 Look Like for Small Cap Stocks?

On December 30, MJP Wealth Advisors chief investment officer Brian Vendig appeared on Yahoo! Finance’s Catalysts to discuss the potential outlook of small cap stocks in 2025. He said that as long as the economy stays stable and policy decisions are not taken to the extreme, small cap stocks could see the perfect environment to outperform in 2025. However, a little cooperation from the Fed is essential to maintaining this perfect environment.

He also believed that the market is likely to come back to earnings. Vendig explained that the market is expected to be choppy in the first few months of 2025. This trend is likely to materialize throughout the first half of 2025, with the choppiness attributed to policy uncertainties. But Vendig believed that if earnings remain intact, he will likely stay constructive on stocks. He even thinks that bonds might be a good opportunity as well. He said:

“I’m definitely not one to recommend to add to megacap tech at this point, but I think taking a look at some of those value-oriented sectors that help to play into innovation and growth for the economy still makes sense.”

He also highlighted that potential opportunities may emerge in the industrial sectors, such as infrastructure, electric grid enhancements, and power generation, along with some in pharmaceuticals and biotech.

Will the Fed and Incoming Trump Administration Bolster Small Cap Stocks?

Several other analysts have similar predictions as Vendig’s. On December 24, Global Advisors’ managing partner, Tom Lee, appeared on CNBC and highlighted the potential of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025, saying that this year will likely be a positive one for these companies. He reasoned that the incoming Trump administration and interest rate cuts are likely to make companies more expansionary, boosting their confidence regarding mergers. He even said that small caps may outperform by more than 100% in the coming years.

Our Methodology

Is Royalty Pharma plc (RPRX) The Best Defensive Stock Amid Market Volatility?,"Given the evolving nature of defensive sectors, investors need a more nuanced approach. One such approach focuses on low-volatility stocks, as highlighted by Fidelity Investments. The firm recently highlighted that stocks with lower volatility tend to decline less during market downturns compared to lower-quality stocks. While adding such stocks to a portfolio may help cushion losses in turbulent markets, it can also lead to more moderate gains in strong markets. Though lower-volatility portfolios reduce downside risk, they don’t eliminate it. Historically, portfolios optimized for risk-adjusted returns have delivered higher long-term gains but with greater fluctuations. One way to build a more defensive portfolio is by focusing on stocks with a history of stability, often due to industry positioning, competitive strength, or solid financials. These stocks can help mitigate losses during market selloffs.

Adam also noted that while utilities remain defensive, rising AI-related power demands have led to speculative valuations, reducing their diversification benefits in an inflation-driven sell-off. Consumer staples can provide stability in various conditions, but historically, they have been most effective when trading at a discount to the broader market. So, while these sectors still offer defensive characteristics, investors should be careful to assess valuations and market conditions before making decisions on buying such stocks or constructing defensive portfolios.

That said, the investing landscape has evolved dramatically over the last two decades and the well-known defensive sectors are not as defensive as they used to be. To make this point clear, we refer to a March report by investment management firm T. Rowe Price where investment experts discussed portfolio construction and the sectors likely to outperform during a broad market downturn. They highlighted consumer staples, health care, and utilities as potential defensive plays. Adam Marden, one of the T. Rowe Price experts, emphasized health care’s strength, citing long-term demographic trends, a favourable cyclical outlook in health care tools, and biotech’s improving industry structure.

With ongoing inflation, economic uncertainty, and global tensions, more investors are looking for ways to protect their money while still earning steady returns. Defensive stocks have historically provided such resilience. These stocks, characterized by their stability and ability to generate consistent returns, offer an attractive investment strategy during periods of market turbulence. They typically belong to sectors such as consumer staples, telecom, healthcare, and utilities which are the industries that maintain steady demand regardless of economic conditions. As investors seek ways to protect their portfolios from downturns, defensive stocks emerge as a crucial component of a well-balanced investment strategy.

We recently published a list of 15 Best Defensive Stocks Amid Market Volatility In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) stands against other best defensive stocks amid market volatility.

Story Continues

Amid this evolving market environment, experts stress the importance of defensive positioning. In a March 15 interview with CNBC, Adam Parker, CEO and founder of Trivariate Research, emphasized that market positioning and expectations are currently misaligned in the market. While many investors have turned bearish, he believes there hasn’t been enough of a positioning shakeout to justify turning bullish just yet. He emphasized that companies’ upcoming earnings guidance will be crucial. If companies lower forecasts and stock prices remain resilient, it could indicate a buying opportunity. He highlighted the importance of playing more defense than offense until market conditions clarify.

Conclusion

Defensive stocks indeed play a critical role in investor portfolios, particularly during volatile market environments. While they may underperform in strong bull markets, their ability to provide stability and mitigate downside risk makes them a valuable asset for long-term investors. By focusing on companies with consistent earnings, strong financials, and a history of resilience, investors can navigate market uncertainties more effectively.

Our Methodology

To determine the 15 best defensive stocks, we began by filtering U.S.-listed companies with a market capitalization exceeding $2 billion across four key defensive sectors: consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, residential real estate, pharmaceuticals, and telecom. Next, we applied three main selection criteria: a beta of less than 1, positive EPS growth over the past three years and the upcoming financial year, and a dividend yield above 1%. From the resulting list, we identified the top 10 stocks with the highest hedge fund ownership, using data from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 hedge fund database. Finally, we ranked these stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding positions in them.

Note: All pricing data is as of market close on March 21.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX)

Beta: 0.47

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39

Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) has a slightly different model as compared to pharma peers. The company buys biopharmaceutical royalties, offering funding to life sciences companies and research institutions in exchange for future royalty payments. Its portfolio includes interests in blockbuster drugs across various therapeutic areas, including oncology, rare diseases, and neurology.

In late January, BofA Securities analyst Jason Gerberry reaffirmed a Buy rating on Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) and raised the price target from $38 to $41. He cited the internalization of RP Management LLC (RP) and upcoming financial catalysts as key drivers. RP internalization simplifies financial reporting, aligns management with shareholders, and boosts portfolio cash flow, despite potential equity dilution. The analyst also expected major growth opportunities, including the launch of Alyftrek, which could convert many Trikafta therapy patients, and key drug trial results from Novartis and Bristol, potentially accelerating the company’s expansion. In mid-February, Citi analyst Geoff Meacham also reiterated a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $40, implying a 19% upside.

Overall, RPRX ranks 12th on our list of best defensive stocks amid market volatility.

Why Royalty Pharma Plc (RPRX) is the Best Performing Pharma Stock So Far in 2025,"“Despite the ongoing craze surrounding the GLP-1 obesity drugs, the healthcare sector was a lagger last year. On January 3, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America’s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ to talk about the healthcare sector’s outlook in 2025. While he anticipates another year of underperformance for the sector, he also believes that healthcare has “been so bad, maybe it’s gonna be good” in 2025.

We recently discussed the healthcare sector and its dynamics in the stock market in a recently published article on the 10 Best Performing Healthcare Stocks So Far in 2025 . Here is an excerpt from the article:

Looking at the pharma and biotech sector, Holz opined that much of the underperformance of the past few years can be attributed to the nebulousness surrounding policies. The industry is now facing the current administration, which is much more apt to be rogue in terms of policy by many accounts. That has put a lid on the subsectors and their performance in the industry. He said that at some point, the pharma industry will thaw. While he isn’t sure which factors could potentially lead to this thawing, he is sure about the outcome, as there is likely to be a more definitive strategy and plan for how things would go in the industry. The February 20 meeting of the pharma industry’s biggest lobbying group with President Trump could be a factor behind this potential outcome.

On February 20, Jared Holz, Mizuho healthcare sector strategist, appeared on ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the potential challenges and opportunities the pharmaceutical industry may face under the new Trump administration. Talking about the pharma’s agenda in Washington, where the big names of the pharma industry were set to meet with President Trump on February 20, Holz said that while it is tough to talk about the valuation of pharma companies, the significance of the meeting is to have a sort of collaborative effort between the industry and the government to see where they can move things over time. The stocks have exhibited either a little bit or a lot of worry over the RFK front, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. This was based on the nomination made last year, along with the comments made by either him or other appointees to this government.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ: RPRX ) stands against the other best performing pharma stocks so far in 2025.

Where Does India Come in With Trump’s Tariffs?

On February 13, Ramesh Swaminathan, Global CFO of pharmaceutical company Lupin, appeared on CNBC to talk about where India comes in, in the materialization and effects of Trump’s tariffs. He warned that the tariffs may deny a number of American citizens access to critical medications, as a substantial share of these pharmaceutical drugs comes from India. According to CNBC, US imports of pharmaceutical products totaled $176 billion from overseas and $6 billion from China in 2023.

Swaminathan said that since nearly 45% to 50% of the pharmaceuticals sold in America are of Indian origin, the tariffs will undoubtedly impact the common person. However, since there are several reciprocal tariffs in the works, it is difficult to understand what ultimately would happen in the industry, and a number of scenarios are open for discussion.

Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ:RPRX)

YTD Performance: 30.05%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39

Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) is a funder of innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry and a buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties. It collaborates with innovators from research hospitals, non-profits, and academic institutions through small and mid-cap biotech companies to global pharma companies. The company funds innovation in the industry both directly, by partnering with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly, by acquiring existing royalties from the original innovators. Royalty Pharma Plc’s (NASDAQ:RPRX) portfolio includes royalties in over 35 commercial products, including Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica, Novartis’ Promacta, Pfizer’s Xtandi, Pfizer’s Nurtec ODT, and others.

The company delivered $2.8 billion in Portfolio Receipts for fiscal year 2024, at the high end of its guidance range. This reflects a 13% growth, significantly exceeding its initial guidance of 5% to 9%. In 2025, Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) expects Portfolio Receipts of $2.9 billion to $3.05 billion. It has added royalties on AD therapy to its portfolio, including four development space therapies.

The company is seeing positive news across its portfolio, including the FDA approval of Voranigo for brain cancer, Tremfya for ulcerative colitis, and Cobenfy for schizophrenia. It deployed capital of $2.8 billion to further broaden its portfolio, along with $230 million for share repurchases. Its Board recently authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase plan, and Royalty Pharma Plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) intends to repurchase $2 billion in 2025. The company ranks tenth on our list of the 10 best performing pharma stocks so far in 2025.

Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“While Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) is in the healthcare space, it is more like an investment firm that buys royalty assets in the healthcare space. The company has an extremely strong track record, running the business for over 20 years as a private fund before bringing it public. The market opportunity for external royalty funding has only grown as early-stage start-ups need funding and legacy players are looking to lower their debt levels. We think Royalty Pharma is perfectly positioned as the partner of choice. The company is disciplined, maintaining deal internal rate of returns (IRRs) in the low-teens despite the higher interest rate environment. We think as the company continues to deliver as a public company, the market will start paying attention.”

Overall, RPRX ranks 10th on our list of the best performing pharma stocks so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of RPRX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you provide more detail on the guidance assumptions for Alyftrek and Tysabri, and are there any milestones included in the 2025 Portfolio Receipt guidance? A: We haven't provided specific product guidance for Alyftrek and Tysabri, but we expect both to be important contributors. The 2025 guidance includes approximately $60 million in milestones, excluding the MorphoSys payment.

Q: How do you view the risks from new policies in Washington, particularly regarding taxes or IRA impacts? A: We don't foresee any changes in taxation impacting our business. We are closely monitoring the situation and engaging with industry leaders to understand the implications of new healthcare policies.

Q: How do synthetic royalties compare to traditional structures in terms of returns, and what is the outlook for this segment? A: Synthetic royalties offer attractive returns and expand our market opportunities. They provide non-dilutive funding solutions, allowing partners to retain operational control, which is increasingly appealing in the sector.

Q: Given Royalty Pharma's history of outperforming guidance, is the 2025 top-line guidance conservative? A: Historically, we have outperformed due to the nature of our portfolio. While we are confident in our momentum, it's early in the year, and our guidance reflects a range of scenarios.

Q: What are the most common reasons for not pursuing a transaction from the initial reviews? A: Our selection process is disciplined, focusing on product quality, patient importance, partner strength, clinical data, and commercial potential. Stage of development and intellectual property are key factors in our decision-making.

Q: How does Royalty Pharma's global reach impact its investment strategy, particularly in regions like China? A: Our business is global, and we actively engage with top Chinese biotech companies. While we don't have a physical presence in China, we maintain strong relationships and plan to increase interactions in the region.

Q: What is the impact of the IRA Part D redesign on your portfolio, and are there any products that might be mispriced by the market? A: The initial Part D exposure is modest, with Imbruvica, Xtandi, and Trelegy being the main products affected. We are monitoring the situation closely, balancing potential revenue impacts with lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Q: Regarding the internalization, does the 10% operating cost guidance reflect this change, and what are the expected savings? A: The 10% guidance does not reflect internalization. Post-internalization, we expect operating costs to be around 4% to 5%, with anticipated savings of $100 million reflected in this reduced percentage.

Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) Misses Q4 Revenue Estimates,"The branded pharmaceutical industry relies on a high-cost, high-reward business model, driven by substantial investments in research and development to create innovative, patent-protected drugs. Successful products can generate significant revenue streams over their patent life, and the larger a roster of drugs, the stronger a moat a company enjoys. However, the business model is inherently risky, with high failure rates during clinical trials, lengthy regulatory approval processes, and intense competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers once patents expire. These challenges, combined with scrutiny over drug pricing, create a complex operating environment. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned for tailwinds from advancements in precision medicine, increasing adoption of AI to enhance drug development efficiency, and growing global demand for treatments addressing chronic and rare diseases. However, headwinds include heightened regulatory scrutiny, pricing pressures from governments and insurers, and the looming patent cliffs for key blockbuster drugs. Patent cliffs bring about competition from generics, forcing branded pharmaceutical companies back to the drawing board to find the next big thing.

“We had an incredibly successful 2024, delivering double-digit growth in Royalty Receipts, which was significantly above our initial guidance, and deploying $2.8 billion of capital on value-enhancing royalties” said Pablo Legorreta, Royalty Pharma’s founder and Chief Executive Officer.

Operating Margin: 60.9%, down from 103% in the same quarter last year

Healthcare royalties company Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) missed Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, with sales flat year on year at $594 million. Its GAAP profit of $0.57 per share was significantly above analysts’ consensus estimates.

Story Continues

Sales Growth

Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Royalty Pharma grew its sales at a mediocre 4.5% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.

Royalty Pharma Quarterly Revenue

We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Royalty Pharma’s recent history shows its demand slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years.

Royalty Pharma Year-On-Year Revenue Growth

Royalty Pharma also breaks out the revenue for its most important segment, Portfolio Receipts. Over the last two years, Royalty Pharma’s Portfolio Receipts revenue averaged 10.7% year-on-year growth. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company’s performance.

This quarter, Royalty Pharma missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.3% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $594 million of revenue.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 17.3% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is commendable and indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance.

While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.

Operating Margin

Royalty Pharma has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a healthcare business, boasting an average operating margin of 54.3%.

Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Royalty Pharma’s operating margin decreased by 18.1 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 43.4 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see Royalty Pharma become more profitable in the future.

Royalty Pharma Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)

This quarter, Royalty Pharma generated an operating profit margin of 60.9%, down 41.9 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was recently less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.

Earnings Per Share

We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.

Sadly for Royalty Pharma, its EPS declined by 17.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 4.5%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.

Royalty Pharma Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP)

Diving into the nuances of Royalty Pharma’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Royalty Pharma’s operating margin declined by 18.1 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals.

In Q4, Royalty Pharma reported EPS at $0.57, down from $0.83 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts’ estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data.

Key Takeaways from Royalty Pharma’s Q4 Results

We were impressed by how significantly Royalty Pharma blew past analysts’ portfolio receipts and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year guidance for portfolio receipts exceeded Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this quarter was solid. The stock traded up 2.2% to $32.45 immediately after reporting.

So do we think Royalty Pharma is an attractive buy at the current price? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Is Now The Time To Put Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) On Your Watchlist?,"Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.

In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Royalty Pharma with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

Royalty Pharma's Earnings Per Share Are Growing

If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Royalty Pharma has grown EPS by 10% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.

One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. We note that while EBIT margins have improved from 44% to 68%, the company has actually reported a fall in revenue by 2.5%. That falls short of ideal.

Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.9b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.

Should You Add Royalty Pharma To Your Watchlist?

Viking Global's Stake: $342.1 million

Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) is a New York-based firm that operates in the pharma sector. The following factors make this company stand out as a worthwhile investment. Firstly, as per the report of the third quarter of 2024, the company delivered strong growth of approximately 15% in Portfolio Receipts and raised full-year guidance. Additionally, the company also strengthened its portfolio by adding royalties on three innovative therapies over the last three months, increasing Capital Deployment to approximately $1.2 billion in the third quarter and $2.6 billion year-to-date.

Royalty Pharma plc (RPRX): Analysts Recommend This 52-Week High Stocks Now,"We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) stands against the other stocks.

After two years of substantial gains to record highs, exhaustion in the US equity markets is slowly kicking in. Pullbacks in various sectors have come into play amid growing concerns about overstretched valuations. Likewise, the pullbacks have come on bond yields surging to levels not seen in two months, triggering a selloff in growth-oriented stocks.

The 10-year yield touching highs of 4.79% has once again triggered demand for bonds at the expense of stocks, given the yields on offer. Additionally, the surge in bond yields comes on stronger-than-expected jobs reports that cast doubt on further interest rate cuts. The stock market rallied to record highs last year amid expectations that the Fed will embark on an aggressive easing push that involves interest rate cuts.

A spike in inflation levels amid a resilient US job market has once again averted the prospects of the Fed aggressively cutting interest rates. Consequently, the global rise in bond yields around the globe is being driven by expectations of fewer than expected interest rate cuts.

“With the 10-year yield potentially getting to 5%, I think it’s going to be very hard for the equity market to really gain any meaningful traction here until there’s — at minimum — stability in interest rates,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.

The sentiments echo serious concerns about stocks trading at 52-week highs after blockbuster moves last year. Given that valuations at 52-week highs often appear overstretched, there are growing concerns that some of the stocks could be the subject of significant pullbacks. Amid the concerns, Turnquist does not see the prospect of the market edging into bear territory even though the market appears to be in a correction phase.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the equity market's outlook and believe there is not enough reason to back away from investing. Additionally, the analysts don’t expect 2025 to be a problematic year for equity investments.

Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.22,"Royalty Pharma plc's (NASDAQ:RPRX) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 10th of March to $0.22, with investors receiving 4.8% more than last year's $0.21. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.8%, which is in line with the average for the industry.

Royalty Pharma's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings

While it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, Royalty Pharma's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.

Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 11.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 47%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.

NasdaqGS:RPRX Historic Dividend January 13th 2025

Royalty Pharma Doesn't Have A Long Payment History

The dividend hasn't seen any major cuts in the past, but the company has only been paying a dividend for 4 years, which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. Since 2021, the dividend has gone from $0.60 total annually to $0.84. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing as a reasonable rate, which we like. However, investors will probably want to see a longer track record before they consider Royalty Pharma to be a consistent dividend paying stock.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Royalty Pharma has impressed us by growing EPS at 10% per year over the past three years. Royalty Pharma definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.

In Summary

In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Royalty Pharma's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.

Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Royalty Pharma that you should be aware of before investing. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.

Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX)

Royalty Pharma plc (NASDAQ:RPRX) saw its share price increase by 14.26 percent to end at $29.49 apiece versus the $25.81 posted the week prior, following news that it was set to acquire its external manager RP Management, as it seeks to simplify its corporate structure.

On a financial basis, the acquisition plan was expected to generate cash savings for the company of up to $100 million in 2026, more than $175 in 2030, and drive cumulative savings worth at least $1.6 billion over ten years.

Overall RPRX ranks 8th on our list of the firms that led this week's rally.

BRP Inc (DOOO) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Navigating Challenges with Strategic Inventory ...,"Q : How do you view the industry inventory backdrop and competitive pricing when contemplating revenue and margin growth? A : Sebastien Martel, CFO, explained that BRP proactively reduced production and shipments to manage inventory levels, starting the year in a better position than some competitors. However, other OEMs have higher noncurrent inventory, which may lead to more incentives in the second quarter. BRP expects more normalized inventory levels by the back half of Q2 and into the second half of the year.

The company refrained from issuing guidance for fiscal '26 due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and consumer demand, making it difficult to forecast with confidence.

BRP Inc ( NASDAQ:DOOO ) saw a 21% decline in North American powersports retail in Q4, with a notable 30% drop in 3-wheel vehicle retail.

BRP Inc ( NASDAQ:DOOO ) introduced several new models and expanded into new segments, including the launch of the Can-Am electric motorcycle, positioning the business for long-term success.

The company maintained strong demand for high-end products, such as the Defender cab, gaining about 2 points of market share in the utility segment.

BRP Inc ( NASDAQ:DOOO ) significantly reduced network inventory levels, achieving an 18% reduction in North American powersport inventory, aligning with their objective of 15% to 20%.

The company ended the year with $7.8 billion in revenue, normalized EBITDA of $1 billion, and a normalized EPS of $4.68, all within their revised guidance range.

Q: What are your expectations for production, CapEx, and cash flow for the year? A: Sebastien Martel, CFO, stated that BRP expects solid free cash flow generation, with working capital as a potential minor tailwind. CapEx is expected to be slightly higher than last year, mainly due to foreign exchange rates. BRP remains flexible and will adapt plans if challenges arise.

Q: Will the non-current inventory situation be an overhang in fiscal '26, and do you expect to lose market share until it's resolved? A: Jose Boisjoli, CEO, noted that some OEMs still have high non-current inventory, particularly in ORV. BRP expects market share challenges in the first half of the year but is confident about the second half once inventory levels normalize.

Q: How do you view retail demand in North America, and what trends are you seeing? A: Jose Boisjoli, CEO, mentioned that high-end products are selling well, while entry-level products are softer due to inflation and high interest rates. BRP is losing some share in non-current categories but is gaining momentum in current categories.

Q: Can you provide an update on the Marine sale and any other potential divestitures? A: Jose Boisjoli, CEO, stated that the Marine sale process is ongoing and on plan, targeting completion by the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2. No additional divestitures were mentioned.

"Ski-Doo Maker Soars on Earnings Beat, But Tariffs Dim Outlook","(Bloomberg) -- BRP Inc.’s earnings came in ahead of analyst expectations, pushing the stock to its best intraday performance of the year.

Most Read from Bloomberg

But the Canadian maker of Ski-Doo snowmobiles and Sea-Doo jet skis warned that its outlook is in flux, as the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs could deliver a $40 million hit to the business if they stay in place all year. The Quebec-based company is deferring its fiscal 2026 guidance because of the uncertainty.

Canadian traded shares of BRP were up 7.5% to C$54.59 by 11:38 a.m. in Toronto. The stock closed Tuesday at its lowest level since June 2020.

BRP’s customers are staying on the sidelines even though its products are more affordable now than they would be after tariffs are imposed, Chief Executive Officer Jose Boisjoli said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. “That uncertainty is a bigger overhang than the potential opportunity of buying a product with no tariffs today,” he said. “So, it says a lot about how the consumer is feeling.”

BRP reported adjusted earnings of 98 Canadian cents per share in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with an average estimate of 87 Canadian cents in a Bloomberg analysts survey. Revenue of C$2.1 billion fell by double digits from a year ago but beat expectations of C$1.97 billion.

The company topped expectations across all of its segments, Desjardins Securities, most which was driven by its off-road vehicle segment pricing, analyst Benoit Poirier said. Year-round products earned C$1.1 billion, which also was higher than estimates.

A slowdown in discretionary consumer spending has been weighing on BRP, as customers hold off on buying big ticket items. Trump’s threat to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum products added to the company’s woes, sending the stock price down 25% this year.

"BRP Stock Climbs After Q4 Earnings Top Estimates, Outlook Held Back Amid Trade Uncertainty","BRP Inc. (NASDAQ:DOOO) shares traded higher on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.

The company reported a revenue decrease of 19.7% year-over-year to C$2.098 billion. In USD, revenues of $1.48 billion beat the street view of $1.35 billion.

Adjusted EPS of C$0.98 declined C$1.80 per share from the year-ago quarter. In USD, adjusted EPS was $0.69 above the consensus of $0.62.

The revenue decline was primarily due to lower sales volume across all product lines on weak demand and increasing sales programs.

North American retail sales dipped 21% Y/Y owing to weak industry volumes in Snowmobile and market share loss in Off-Road Vehicles on high non-current inventory from other OEMs.

Year-Round Products (54% of sales) revenues decreased 17.4% Y/Y to C$1.13 billion, primarily due to lower sales volume, unfavourable product mix in SSV and higher sales programs.

Seasonal Products (32% of sales) revenues dropped 28.9% Y/Y to C$677.6 million.

Powersports PA&A and OEM Engines (14% of sales) revenues declined 0.7% Y/Y to C$292.9 million, attributed to lower demand.

Gross profit decreased by 35.0% Y/Y, to C$429.4 million, and the margin contracted by 480 bps to 20.5%.

Normalized EBITDA decreased 44.6% Y/Y to C$239.8 million, reflecting lower gross margin.

BRP generated C$740.1 million in net operating cash flows for the year, down from C$1.658 billion a year earlier, due to lower profitability and unfavorable working capital changes.

On March 25, 2025, the company declared a quarterly dividend of C$0.215 per share, payable on April 18, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 4, 2025.

Outlook: BRP decided to defer providing FY26 guidance, owing to ongoing global tariff disputes and uncertainty related to potential changes to trade regulations.

José Boisjoli, President and CEO of BRP said, “BRP demonstrated its agility throughout fiscal 2025 by rapidly adapting to softer market conditions. We were the first OEM to proactively adjust shipments to reduce network inventory and we have achieved our objective.”

”Over the longer term, our strategic decision to double down on Powersports should allow us to solidify our industry leadership by pushing innovation further and capitalizing on growth opportunities.”

Price Action: DOOO shares are up 8.81% at $38.67 at the last check Wednesday.

BRP Inc. (DOOO) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"BRP Inc. (DOOO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of 70%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

BRP , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.48 billion for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.98 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

BRP shares have lost about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -1.8%.

What's Next for BRP?

While BRP has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for BRP: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.86 on $1.27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.37 on $5.41 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",2025-03-26 11:30:02,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brp-inc-dooo-beats-q4-113002605.html,Yahoo Finance

"Citi cuts rating on Polaris, BRP to ‘sell’ on tariff risks","Investing.com -- Citi downgraded Polaris (NYSE:PII) Inc and BRP Inc (NASDAQ:DOOO) to Sell from Neutral given the deteriorating fundamentals, growing tariff risks, and a worsening promotional environment in the U.S. leisure market.



Citi cut its price targets to $33 for Polaris and $41 for BRP, warning that potential tariffs on Mexico and Canada could significantly erode earnings.

Citi’s note highlighted that both companies face immediate challenges from an incremental 20% Chinese tariff, bringing the total to 30%, and the potential for indefinite 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports.

“Were 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports to be levied indefinitely (an unlikely but distinct possibility), we believe that both companies would immediately incur significant losses, impacting their long-term prospects,” Citi said.

Polaris' North American off-road vehicle (ORV) retail sales are trending toward a low-double-digit decline in Q1, with high-teens declines in February and a mid-single-digit drop in early March, according to Citi's dealer checks.

Dealers reported weakening sentiment and elevated inventory levels despite shipment cuts from PII and DOO.



“The dealer consensus is that price increases from tariffs will be bad for the industry, with most expecting at least some incremental slowdown as a result,” the note added.

Polaris derives about $2 billion of its revenue from products imported from Mexico to the U.S., with 30% margins on those products. Citi estimates that a 25% Mexican tariff could reduce EPS by $4.60, while additional impacts of $0.66 from China and $0.16 from Canada could push Polaris’ 2025 earnings from a guided $1.10 to a $4.00 loss.

For BRP, with 70% of its cost of goods sourced from Mexico, Citi estimates a potential EPS cut of over $11 in a full-tariff scenario, leaving the company in an equally “untenable situation.”

Citi’s revised targets reflect the risk of permanent tariff scenarios and weaker near-term fundamentals. Polaris faces potential dividend and debt covenant challenges if tariffs escalate, while BRP’s heavy reliance on Mexican imports makes it especially vulnerable.

Even in the absence of extreme tariff scenarios, the weakening of fundamentals in conjunction with the incremental Chinese tariffs is enough to weigh on valuations going forward.

Canada’s Retaliation to US Tariffs

On March 12, CNBC reported that after the European Union, Canada also announced that it would impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods. Canada has imposed a 25% tariff, mainly targeting steel and aluminum, but will also hit some of the other US exports, including computers, sports equipment, and cast iron products. CNBC’s Megan Cassella while analyzing this move mentioned that the economic impact of these tariffs can be estimated beforehand as this is very similar to President Trump’s first term when he imposed similar tariffs. She noted that President Trump had imposed similar tariffs in 2018, but later had to carve out many countries because of the economic impact. Although there was some modest help for the local aluminum producers back in 2018, however, all steel and aluminum users were impacted and as a result the overall net economic impact was negative.

While quoting research by the Federal Reserve, Cassella noted that tariffs boosted employment in manufacturing by around 0.3%. However, the rising input cost dragged down the same sector employment by around 1.1% and retaliation pulled it down another 0.7%. Therefore the net economic impact at the end was recorded to be -1.4% to the sector, which accounts for a direct loss of around 75,000 manufacturing jobs. Moreover, economists at the Peterson Institute estimated that there was a cost of about $900,000 for every job saved or created in the steel industry. Cassella further elaborated that as of yet the goal of these tariffs remains unclear, due to which the consumers and the manufacturers in the industry are confused as well.

On the other hand, these tariffs add to the economic challenges Canada is facing which include slower population growth, federal policy ambiguity, and inflation. According to Deloitte’s January 2025 Canadian economy forecast, the economy is anticipated to remain positive with 2% GDP growth expected during the year. While the outlook by Deloitte has not factored in the economic impact of US tariffs, it suggests that the government would have to lean in to support the business and local production to fight off the impact of tariffs and enhance productivity.",2025-03-17 19:45:33,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brp-inc-nasdaq-dooo-most-194533886.html,Yahoo Finance

Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, a role that covers various aspects of public health, including medical research and food safety. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee key agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In an NPR interview in November, Kennedy said that Trump had tasked him with eliminating corruption in health agencies, restoring evidence-based practices, and addressing the chronic disease epidemic. It’s not clear how Kennedy’s nomination could impact the healthcare sector as his specific policies are not yet clear and he has yet to receive confirmation by the US Senate.

In the US, healthcare costs and spending have been rising. As reported by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, healthcare spending in the United States reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, reflecting a 7.5% increase from 2022. In 2023, the healthcare sector accounted for 17.6% of the US economy in 2023, up from 17.4% in 2022. Rise in private health insurance and Medicare were the two main drivers of this growth.

Jared Holz, Mizuho’s healthcare expert, said in a note to clients that he acknowledges some of Kennedy’s concerns, such as America’s obesity epidemic and the risks associated with ultra-processed foods. Holz noted that this is a complicated topic but emphasized that there is substantial room for improvement in public health.

However, Kennedy is known as an anti-vaxxer and this has concerned some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry. He has also expressed skepticism about GLP-1s, which he believes are not the solution to the obesity problem. Additionally, Kennedy has advocated for stricter regulations on ultra-processed foods, which are linked to rising obesity rates in the country.

AI is the Most Defining Theme of 2025, Says Expert

Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries.

Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that ""AI is the prevailing theme"" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people.

A Glance at the Tech Sector in 2025

The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially.

Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other ""493 names"" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings.

He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024.

Our Methodology

We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters.

Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:CNTA) Shares Could Be 30% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,"A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.

Does the January share price for Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc ( NASDAQ:CNTA ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

Analyst price target for CNTA is US$28.57, which is 19% above our fair value estimate

Story Continues

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$249m× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.6%) = US$6.1b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.1b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$3.1b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$16.8, the company appears quite good value at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.

NasdaqGS:CNTA Discounted Cash Flow January 1st 2025

Important Assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Centessa Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.868. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Centessa Pharmaceuticals

Strength

Debt is well covered by earnings.

Weakness

Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.

Opportunity

Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.

Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.

Threat

Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.

Not expected to become profitable over the next 3 years.

Moving On:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Centessa Pharmaceuticals, there are three important aspects you should consider:

Amgen shares sink on obesity drug concerns; AstraZeneca to spend $3.5B on manufacturing,"Today, a brief rundown of news involving Amgen and AstraZeneca, as well as updates from Roche, Novartis, and Centessa Pharmaceuticals that you may have missed.

Amgen lost $12 billion in market value Tuesday after a Wall Street analyst published a note suggesting the company’s closely watched obesity drug MariTide might be associated with loss of bone density. The note, from Cantor Fitzgerald’s Olivia Brayer, cited data from volunteers in a Phase 1 trial of MariTide who received the highest drug dose. While the data came from a Nature paper published earlier this year, Brayer uncovered hidden tabs in an Excel file included as part of the supplemental appendix. Amgen’s drug blocks a gut hormone called GIP, which Brayer hypothesized may decrease bone density. On Wednesday, Amgen released a statement saying it “does not see an association between the administration of MariTide and bone mineral density changes.” — Jonathan Gardner

Shares in Lexeo Therapeutics rose by nearly 20% Wednesday after the company said it had reached agreement with the Food and Drug Administration on how to proceed in developing a gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia with cardiomyopathy. The company now plans to measure expression of a protein called frataxin as well as reductions in left ventricular mass index as the two primary goals of a planned registrational study. If successful, Lexeo could pursue an accelerated approval of its therapy, dubbed LX2006. — Ned Pagliarulo

AstraZeneca will spend $3.5 billion to open or expand new research and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. over the next two years, adding more than 1,000 jobs in the process. The funds will be invested in a “next-generation” biologics facility in Maryland, AstraZeneca’s research and development center in Massachusetts, cell therapy manufacturing on both the East and West coasts, and specialty drug production in Texas. Through the first nine months of 2024, AstraZeneca’s capital expenditures amounted to about $1.2 billion. — Jonathan Gardner

Roche is paying $70 million to startup Flare Therapeutics to develop small molecule drugs targeting “transcription factors,” or proteins that turn genes on or off, in oncology. Flare will lead discovery and preclinical activities identifying transcription factors, while Roche will lead preclinical, clinical and commercialization of any products that emerge from the collaboration. Flare could earn additional payments and royalties of up to $1.8 billion based on the success of any products, and has the option to co-fund development of one drug in return for increased payments. Launched in 2021 with backing from Third Rock Ventures, Flare has raised $205 million in venture investment. — Jonathan Gardner

Novartis is paying drug discovery specialist Schrödinger $150 million to start a multi-year research collaboration and expand an agreement giving the Swiss pharmaceutical company access to Schrödinger’s predictive modeling technology. The two companies intend to work together to identify disease targets in therapeutic areas that are central to Novartis’ R&D strategy, and advance “multiple” drugs against them. Novartis will handle clinical development of any candidates that emerge from the partnership. — Ned Pagliarulo

Centessa Pharmaceuticals is discontinuing developing of a hemophilia B treatment in what it described in a statement Tuesday as a ""strategic and data-driven decision"" informed by the ""evolving treatment and market landscape"" for the blood disease. Centessa will instead invest those resources to advance an orexin agonist for narcolepsy and idiopathic hyposomnia. Phase 1 data for that drug, released by the company Tuesday, showed promise, according to analysts. — Ned Pagliarulo

Centessa Pharmaceuticals Plc (CNTA): A Small-Cap Leader in Clinical-Stage Biotech,"As the outlook for the small-cap market brightens, sectors like technology are also poised to benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence and automation. Prial mentioned that these areas could drive innovation and growth within the small-cap segment, offering compelling opportunities for investors. With clear signals from central banks and ongoing technological developments, smaller companies are positioned to capitalize on emerging trends, making them an attractive option for those seeking to diversify and tap into high-potential stocks in the final quarter of the year.

Prial emphasized that stock selection will be critical in this environment, as not all small-cap stocks are likely to benefit from rate cuts equally. She anticipates that some small-cap companies could see earnings growth in the range of 15% to 20% next year, driven by strong fundamentals and growth-oriented business models. According to Prial, while the broader indices may not deliver the same level of returns, select companies within the segment have the potential to outperform significantly.

Nancy Prial, Co-CEO and Senior Portfolio Manager at Essex Investment Management, shared her optimistic outlook for small cap stocks in a recent interview with CNBC on September 30. Prial expects small cap stocks to gain momentum as a result of the rate cuts that have already occurred and additional expected reductions. According to Prial, small-cap stocks remain under-owned in the market and represent only a small percentage of the overall equity market. She highlighted that the conditions are ripe for a strong performance by smaller companies, provided there is a confidence boost from navigating a soft landing rather than a recession.

As we transition from a tumultuous summer in the financial markets, characterized by rising expectations for interest rate cuts and the consequent impacts on stock and bond performances, investors are now navigating a landscape of heightened volatility and uncertainty. The small-cap segment of the stock market has garnered increasing attention in 2024, as expectations of a shift in monetary policy continue to evolve. Since early July, smaller companies have notably outperformed their larger peers, signaling a robust appetite for these stocks despite ongoing economic uncertainty. This trend has spurred interest among investors looking for high-growth potential opportunities within a more volatile market environment.

We recently published a list of 10 Small Cap Stocks with High Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:CNTA) stands against other small cap stocks with high potential.

Story Continues

Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, echoes a similarly bullish sentiment. Lee believes that the recent volatility in small-cap stocks is part of a multi-year bottoming process, driven by economic data and investor expectations. Despite the unpredictability, Lee expects a significant rally in small-cap stocks once there is clarity on the rate cut cycle. He notes that small caps, which typically trade at 10 times forward price-to-earnings ratios, offer better earnings growth prospects than many mega-cap growth stocks. For Lee, the easing of monetary policy and improving fundamentals make small caps a compelling buy, even in the face of near-term volatility.

One of the primary drivers behind the renewed interest in small-cap stocks is the anticipated easing of monetary policy by central banks. As inflation cools down and economic growth slows, analysts widely expect a series of rate cuts in the coming months. Lower borrowing costs would benefit small-cap companies, which often rely on traditional bank loans instead of accessing corporate bond markets like their larger counterparts. As a result, smaller companies are likely to benefit more directly from the expected rate cuts, making them appealing investment opportunities as the economy starts to recover.

While optimism is building, investing in small-cap stocks does come with risks. A significant portion of these companies have reported negative earnings over the past year, emphasizing the need for a selective approach. Analysts recommend focusing on profitable sectors such as financials, utilities, and consumer discretionary, which have shown resilience despite economic headwinds. Financials, for instance, have delivered robust earnings, while utilities have performed well, although they represent a smaller portion of the market capitalization.

By diversifying portfolios with strategically selected small-cap investments and leveraging the stabilizing power of bonds, investors can position themselves to not only weather market fluctuations but also thrive in the evolving economic environment. The remainder of 2024 could very well be a pivotal period for small-cap stocks, providing opportunities for those willing to embrace the associated risks and rewards.

Analysts Rate Centessa Pharmaceuticals Plc (CNTA) as Strong Buy Amid Promising Developments,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Centessa Pharmaceuticals Plc (NASDAQ:CNTA) stands against the other best biotech stocks to buy under $20.

The biotechnology industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing demand for innovative treatments, technological advancements, and government support. The aging population and rising healthcare needs are creating a strong market for new therapies, while breakthroughs in areas like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and AI are enabling the development of novel approaches. Between 2019 and 2021, venture capital firms invested over $52 billion in therapeutic-focused biotech companies worldwide. Of this total, two-thirds was allocated to start-ups with platform technologies.

By addressing critical unmet medical needs, biotech companies are transforming healthcare with groundbreaking therapies. A key development in this space is the launch of the National Bioeconomy Board as part of Biden’s Investing in America agenda. It aims to harness the potential of biotechnology for the U.S. economy.

In addition to this, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology is developing policy recommendations to streamline the regulatory process for biotechnology products. By lowering barriers to entry, more researchers can leverage biotechnology for agricultural applications, supporting U.S. farmers and improving food security. These efforts are expected to create new market opportunities.

Market Growth Forecast

The biotechnology industry has seen an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, along with expectations of declining interest rates which have contributed to a strong start in 2024. As a result, projections indicate the global biotechnology market could reach an impressive $5.7 trillion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 14% from 2024 to 2033. Even the agricultural biotechnology market is forecasted to grow at a 7.9% CAGR, reaching a market value of $232 billion by 2032.

However, despite the market’s potential, significant risks remain when investing in biotech companies. A failure to meet clinical trial endpoints or secure sufficient funding before a product launch can lead to bankruptcy. The risk of failure is especially high in the biotech sector, where drug development typically takes over a decade and has an estimated failure rate of around 90%.",2024-10-09 12:04:19,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-rate-centessa-pharmaceuticals-plc-120419558.html,Yahoo Finance

Sleep-Disorder Focused Centessa Pharmaceuticals Unveils Interim Data From Lead Program In Acutely Sleep-Deprived Healthy Volunteers,"Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:CNTA) released interim data from an ongoing Phase 1 trial of ORX750 in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers.

ORX750 showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in mean sleep latency at the first two doses evaluated (1.0 mg and 2.5 mg) in the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) compared to placebo.

MWT is a daytime sleep study that measures the ability to stay awake for a set period. It can help doctors evaluate how well the person responds to excessive sleepiness treatment.

The interim Phase 1 clinical data for ORX750 demonstrated:

Significantly increased wakefulness in acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers compared to placebo at both doses tested.

Treatment with ORX750 resulted in statistically significant (p<0.05) and clinically meaningful increased sleep latency on the MWT (time to sleep onset over the four sessions performed at ~2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing at 11 p.m., maximum 40 minutes per session) compared to placebo across all doses.

Mean sleep latencies, as measured by the MWT, for 1.0 mg dose of ORX750 and placebo were 18 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively (p-value = 0.04).

Mean sleep latencies for the 2.5 mg dose of ORX750 and placebo were 32 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively (p-value = 0.01).

The 2.5 mg dose was shown to restore normative wakefulness with a mean sleep latency of 32 minutes as measured by the MWT.

Acutely sleep-deprived healthy volunteers who received a 2.5 mg dose of ORX750 showed a significant 1.6-point improvement versus placebo in mean KSS score compared to baseline (p-value = 0.03).

Analyst Forecasts Just Became More Bearish On Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS),"One thing we could say about the analysts on Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) - they aren't optimistic, having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. There was a fairly draconian cut to their revenue estimates, perhaps an implicit admission that previous forecasts were much too optimistic.

Following the downgrade, the most recent consensus for Merus from its 17 analysts is for revenues of US$42m in 2025 which, if met, would be a meaningful 17% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Losses are supposed to balloon 29% to US$4.05 per share. Yet prior to the latest estimates, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$49m and losses of US$3.96 per share in 2025. So there's been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates, with the analysts making a serious cut to their revenue forecasts while also expecting losses per share to increase.

Check out our latest analysis for Merus

NasdaqGM:MRUS Earnings and Revenue Growth March 1st 2025

There was no major change to the consensus price target of US$86.19, signalling that the business is performing roughly in line with expectations, despite lower earnings per share forecasts.

These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Merus' past performance and to peers in the same industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Merus' growth to accelerate, with the forecast 17% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.0% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 20% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Merus is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that analysts increased their loss per share estimates for this year. There was also a drop in their revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider market. Given the stark change in sentiment, we'd understand if investors became more cautious on Merus after today.

Still, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Merus going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.

Of course, seeing company management invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are downgrading their estimates. So you may also wish to search this free list of stocks with high insider ownership.

"Merus N.V. (MRUS) Reports Q4 Loss, Lags Revenue Estimates","Merus N.V. (MRUS) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.41 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.95. This compares to loss of $1.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 56.84%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.90 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.95, delivering a surprise of -5.56%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

Merus , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $9.14 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.35%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.94 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Merus shares have added about 8.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.3%.

What's Next for Merus?

While Merus has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Merus: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$1.08 on $8.04 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$4.18 on $54.05 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.",2025-02-28 00:05:03,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merus-n-v-mrus-reports-000503013.html,Yahoo Finance
Will Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA) Report Negative Earnings Next Week? What You Should Know,"The market expects Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%.

Revenues are expected to be $72.07 million, up 14914.6% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.22% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",2025-02-20 15:01:02,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iovance-biotherapeutics-iova-report-negative-150102463.html,Yahoo Finance
Merus N.V. (MRUS): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential,"We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential.

Improving Trends for Biotech Stocks

While 2024 was a “challenging” year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two.

Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity.

The Fed’s Rate Cuts and Biotech Stocks: Could There Be a Connection?

Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed’s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an “option-like structure” if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates.

Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank’s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks.",2025-01-17 16:08:31,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merus-n-v-mrus-biotech-160831251.html,Yahoo Finance
Companies Like Merus (NASDAQ:MRUS) Are In A Position To Invest In Growth,"Even when a business is losing money, it's possible for shareholders to make money if they buy a good business at the right price. For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But while the successes are well known, investors should not ignore the very many unprofitable companies that simply burn through all their cash and collapse.

So, the natural question for Merus (NASDAQ:MRUS) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.

Check out our latest analysis for Merus

When Might Merus Run Out Of Money?

You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. In September 2024, Merus had US$632m in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was US$157m. Therefore, from September 2024 it had 4.0 years of cash runway. Notably, however, analysts think that Merus will break even (at a free cash flow level) before then. If that happens, then the length of its cash runway, today, would become a moot point. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.

NasdaqGM:MRUS Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025

How Well Is Merus Growing?

Some investors might find it troubling that Merus is actually increasing its cash burn, which is up 10% in the last year. And we must say we find it concerning that operating revenue dropped 21% over the same period. Considering both these metrics, we're a little concerned about how the company is developing. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.

Can Merus Raise More Cash Easily?

Even though it seems like Merus is developing its business nicely, we still like to consider how easily it could raise more money to accelerate growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.",2025-01-15 17:13:14,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-merus-nasdaq-mrus-position-171314577.html,Yahoo Finance
Jim Cramer Says Merus (MRUS) Still ‘Very Speculative’,"We recently published a list of 10 Jim Cramer Stocks to Watch in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) stands against other Jim Cramer stocks to watch in 2025.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC commented on the bearish start of 2025 and said being a bear in the market is “easy” because when the stocks rise no one would remember your outlook but if they fall, you will get the credit for your forethought. Cramer mentioned the reasons why he is bullish on the market in 2025.

First, Cramer believes the departure of FTC Chair Lina Khan would bode well for the market. He called Khan “way over her head” and said she used to oppose “all deals.”

Cramer also said President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff policies are expected to be “negotiable” that would offset their negative impact on companies. He also commented on the expected dynamics in the housing market:

“Housing breaks price we’re already seeing what happens when there’s overbuilding as is case in Florida. Prices come down when mortgage rates go up. What happens? Prices go down. Once prices come down, you know what? Buyers start staying away hoping for still lower prices, and it usually works, causing sellers to panic furiously, cutting prices themselves. They’ll be stuck and can’t move. It’s called the cycle. Although it has been operating normally for the last few years, I think 2025 will be the year the cycle reasserts itself, and the FED will win big on this one.”

Merus (MRUS): FDA Approval and Speculative Future in Cancer Therapy,"We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) stands against other stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight.

Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the outlook for the stock market following a year of strong gains, cautioning that investors’ overly optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead to trouble. As the year draws to a close, brokerages are releasing their official market predictions for 2025, and so far, they are almost universally positive.

He said that this optimism is understandable given the strong earnings season and the significant stock market rally following the election. Cramer noted that many investors are betting that a business-friendly administration will continue to drive better returns.

“See, after all these gains, you gotta get a little squeamish, don’t you? Unless something drastic happens in the next few weeks, we’re in line for our second straight year of 20% plus returns for the S&P 500. First time that’s happened since 1999, ooh, not the best precedent. Plus, the market’s gotten really expensive by historical standards.”

Cramer said that his main worry is that Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself, with too many investors expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than are realistically likely. He highlighted the unusual situation that has unfolded since the Fed’s surprise double rate cut in September. While short-term interest rates have come down, long-term rates set by the bond market have actually risen, creating a stark contrast. He remarked:

“The market’s betting on a December rate cut. Anything that derails that will be bad news for the averages.”

When looking ahead to 2025, Cramer noted a significant lack of consensus about future rate cuts. He pointed to Fed funds futures for December 2025, which show a wide range of predicted outcomes. Investors are betting on anywhere from zero to eight rate cuts by then, with the most likely scenario being three cuts by the end of 2025.

Cramer explained that while he thinks three rate cuts sound reasonable, it also suggests that roughly 41% of the market is anticipating too many cuts over the next year, a scenario that could disappoint many money managers.",2024-12-10 17:07:41,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merus-mrus-fda-approval-speculative-170741944.html,Yahoo Finance
Merus Scores Its First FDA Approval For Lung Cancer Drug,"On Wednesday, the FDA approved Merus N.V.’s (NASDAQ:MRUS) Bizengri (zenocutuzumab-zbco) as the first and only treatment indicated for adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are advanced unresectable or metastatic and harbor a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusion who have disease progression on or after prior systemic therapy.

Bizengri is Merus’s first approved medicine and is based on the proprietary Biclonics technology platform.

These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).

Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

Bizengri 20 mg/mL Injection for Intravenous Use is expected to be available to patients in the coming weeks.

Bizengri’s approval is based on data from the eNRGy trial. In patients with NRG1+ pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=30), Bizengri demonstrated an ORR of 40%.

DOR in NRG1+ pancreatic adenocarcinoma ranged from 3.7 months to 16.6 months. In the same trial, patients with NRG1+ NSCLC (n=64) treated with Bizengri demonstrated an ORR of 33%. The median DOR in NRG1+ NSCLC was 7.4 months.

b writes, “Investor focus remains on petosemtamab, with the next key catalyst for the company being updated data for petosemtamab in previously treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at ESMO Asia on December 7.”

The analyst assumes Bizengri will be priced at roughly $30,000 per treatment and estimates combined peak U.S. sales in NRG1 fusion NSCLC and PDAC attributable to Merus (based on an estimated 8% royalty rate) of roughly $16.5 million.

Merus’ Bizengri granted FDA accelerated approval to treat NRG1+ cancers,"20mg/ml injections of Bizengri will be available to patients in coming weeks. Credit: aslysun / Shutterstock.

Merus’ Bizengri (zenocutuzumab-zbco) has received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), marking “an important milestone” in the treatment of cancers with a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusion, according to the principal investigator of the company’s ongoing trial.

The drug is the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are NRG1-positive (NRG1+) for patients who have disease progression on or after prior systemic therapy.

Bizengri’s accelerated approval follows results from the eNRGy trial (NCT02912949), a multicentre, open-label clinical trial that included 30 patients with NRG1+ pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 64 with NRG1+ NSCLC. The former demonstrated an average overall response rate (ORR) of 40% while the latter experienced an average ORR of 33%.

Continued approval for the use of Bizengri in treating NRG1+ lung and pancreatic cancers will be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

Principal investigator of Merus’ eNRGy trial Alison Schram said: “The FDA approval of Bizengri marks an important milestone for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or NSCLC that is advanced unresectable or metastatic and harbours the NRG1 gene fusion.

“I have seen firsthand how treatment with Bizengri can deliver clinically meaningful outcomes for patients.”

The drug will become available in the coming weeks, in the form of a 20mg/ml injection for intravenous use. It holds a boxed warning for risks of embryo-fetal toxicity, as well as infusion-related reactions (IRRs), hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis and left ventricular dysfunction.

The FDA’s approval of Bizengri for pancreatic and lung cancers follows Merus’ success in finding a commercialisation partner for the drug earlier this week. It announced on 2 December that it would exclusively license Bizengri to Partner Therapeutics for its commercialisation in the US.

Merus’ chief commercial officer Shannon Campbell said: “This approval is a testament to both our technology and strong execution as we continue to develop our multispecific platforms and pipeline, including our lead asset petosemtamab.”

The company shared updated clinical data from its Phase II trial for the use of petosemtamab for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma on 1 December, ahead of its presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia Congress, on 7 December.",2024-12-05 16:35:03,https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/merus-bizengri-granted-fda-accelerated-approval-to-treat-nrg1-cancers/,Yahoo Finance

dLocal collaborates with Belmoney for cross-border payouts,"The collaboration aims to enhance service reliability of cross-border transactions for users in several countries, such as Bangladesh, Ecuador, Peru, and Pakistan. Credit: MacroEcon/ Shutterstock.

Uruguay-based payments platform dLocal has teamed up with Belmoney, a remittance-as-a-service (RAAS) provider in Europe, to support Belmoney in facilitating cross-border payouts

The tie up will integrate over 900 local and alternative payment methods (APMs), including credit and debit cards, bank transfers, and instant transactions.

It aims to enhance service reliability, and cost efficiency of cross-border transactions for users in several countries, such as Bangladesh, Ecuador, Peru, and Pakistan.

Besides, it incorporates digital wallets like OPay in Nigeria and GCash in the Philippines, ensuring secure and prompt fund transfers.

Belmoney plans to leverage dLocal expertise to expand into additional markets such as China, with the objective of establishing itself as Europe’s first RAAS platform.

It aims to assist money transfer operators (MTOs) to scale operations, transaction processing, and compliance for international financial activities with payments infrastructure.

Belmoney CEO and founder Bruno Pedras said: “Our partnership with dLocal is a game-changer in the remittance space. By integrating with dLocal’s comprehensive network, we can significantly lower costs, improve transaction speeds, and provide a better cross-border payments experience for both senders and recipients.”

dLocal head of remittances Martin Sapiurka stated: “At dLocal we are committed to simplifying global payments in emerging markets. The collaboration with Belmoney ensures that more people in underserved regions have access to fast, reliable, and cost-effective cross-border payments in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

DLocal Limited (DLO): A Bull Case Theory,"We came across a bullish thesis on DLocal Limited (DLO) on Substack by Oliver | MMMT Wealth. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on DLO. DLocal Limited (DLO)'s share was trading at $9.74 as of March 5th. DLO’s trailing and forward P/E were 24.97 and 17.36 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Is Summit State Bank (SSBI) the Worst Performing Bank Stock in 2024?

DLocal (DLO) has faced recent underperformance, but its long-term growth potential remains intact. As a fintech company focused on emerging markets, it provides global merchants with a streamlined solution for navigating complex regulatory and operational landscapes. Unlike payment providers such as Stripe and Adyen, which cater primarily to developed markets, DLO specializes in regions where compliance and infrastructure challenges make in-house payment solutions costly and inefficient. This unique positioning allows the company to serve businesses looking to expand into high-growth markets without taking on the burdens of local compliance.

With revenue growth of 8.8%, a net income margin of 14.5%, and an EV/Sales multiple of 2.3x, DLO remains attractively valued. Long-term macroeconomic trends, including the increasing digitalization of emerging economies, support its outlook, with cross-border payments projected to exceed $65 trillion by 2030. After a volatile 18 months, the company is showing signs of stabilization, driven by improving take rates, greater transaction volume diversification, and reaccelerating total payment volume (TPV). As digital payments continue to expand in emerging markets, DLO is positioned to capture a meaningful share of this growth. Despite near-term challenges, it presents a long-term investment opportunity with significant upside potential.

Why DLocal Stock Got Hammered Today,"Shares of financial technology (fintech) company DLocal (DLO -5.97%) got hammered on Friday after the company reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. The Uruguayan company's take rates are falling, unsettling investors. And that's why DLocal stock was down a crushing 32% as of 2:50 p.m. ET.

DLocal's financial results fell short of expectations

Investors who like growth likely enjoyed reading parts of DLocal's Q4 report. The company's total payment volume was up an incredible 45% in 2024, including a 51% year-over-year jump in Q4. This volume growth allowed its Q4 revenue to grow by 9% to $205 million and its Q4 net income to increase by 4% to nearly $30 million.

Observant investors will notice a steep drop-off in the growth rate for payment volume and revenue. And this is because DLocal's take rate -- the amount of a transaction that it gets to keep -- is falling. The take rate was around 1.2% going into the quarter, but in Q4 it dropped to 1.1%.

This small drop worries investors because of what it could imply. DLocal allows merchants to accept international payments in local currency, and investors are nervous that other fintech players can outcompete. The declining take rate could suggest competitive pressures.

Moreover, in the third quarter DLocal's management had said that its take rate was stabilizing. Therefore, the Q4 dip was also somewhat unexpected and contributed to the big drop with DLocal stock today.

What's next for DLocal?

For 2025, DLocal expects ongoing stellar growth in payment volume with a 35% to 45% growth rate, which is great. But it only expects revenue growth of 25% to 35%, implying even more of a slip in the take rate.

For investors who believe that DLocal can outcompete rivals, this is interesting. The stock trades at a cheap valuation given its projected 25%-to-35% growth. And the lower take rate could simply be indicative of working with higher-volume customers, not necessarily competitive pressures. If that's true, then DLocal stock could be positioned for better returns in 2025 after today's drop.",2025-02-28 20:37:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/28/why-dlocal-stock-got-hammered-today/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=5adbe3cf-f11f-4f84-bee1-7dbed07dc0e4,Yahoo Finance
Why DLocal Shares Plunged This Week,"Shares of payment platform DLocal (DLO -5.97%) were down 29% this week at 12:30 p.m. ET, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

DLocal reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and missed analysts' expectations for sales and earnings per share. While its guidance to grow total payment volume (TPV) by 40% in 2025 is promising, the company and its shorter-term profitability woes worried the market.

High-speed growth, but at what cost?

DLocal's payment platform solves for the complexities of trying to sell anything in an emerging market. Offering over 900 payment options in roughly 40 countries, DLocal boosts its customers' conversion rates in emerging markets, home to over 2 billion people.

The company's platform is a no-brainer solution for some of the world's largest companies, such as Amazon, Shopify, Netflix, and Spotify. Growing alongside juggernauts like these, DLocal again delivered impressive TPV growth of 45% in Q4 -- even if this was below expectations.

However, the company's declining margins and take rate were the bigger concern. Although TPV was up 45% in Q4, revenue and gross profit only rose 15% and 6%, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined by 7%.

Similarly, the company's take rate (gross profit divided by TPV) slipped from 1.2% in Q3 to 1.1% after it had remained flat (an improvement) over the last three quarters.

In oversimplified terms, the volatile nature of operating in emerging economies can lead to short-term disappointments like this for DLocal.

What's next for DLocal?

Ultimately, DLocal remains a profitable enterprise that generates positive free cash flow and will likely see continued TPV growth. Trading at 24 times earnings today and 16 times next year's earnings, DLocal remains one of my favorite growth stocks.

Interested investors will need to brace for volatility with this one, however.",2025-02-28 17:50:57,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/28/why-dlocal-shares-plunged-this-week/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=3154d739-390a-4a76-b408-2c54d187dceb,Yahoo Finance
DLocal Ltd (DLO) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Highlights: Record TPV and Strategic Expansions Amid ...,"Release Date: February 27, 2025

For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

Positive Points

DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ:DLO) achieved a record TPV of $26 billion in 2024, marking a 45% year-over-year increase.

The company delivered a gross profit of $295 million and maintained a strong adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin of 64%.

DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ:DLO) expanded its team significantly, adding 194 new talents, particularly in technology and product development.

The company launched 20 new payment methods for pay-ins and seven for payouts, enhancing its product offerings.

DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ:DLO) secured nine new licenses globally, expanding its product offerings and access to new growth opportunities.

Negative Points

The company experienced a decline in gross profit in its largest markets, Brazil and Mexico, despite overall growth.

Currency devaluations, particularly in Nigeria, negatively impacted revenue growth.

There was a noted compression in the net take rate due to higher volumes driving lower take rates and increased payout share.

DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ:DLO) faced challenges with temporary settlement delays and changes in settlement periods affecting cash flow.

The company anticipates potential tightening of FX spreads in certain geographies, which could impact financial performance.

Q & A Highlights

Q: How does DLocal factor in foreign exchange (FX) when setting guidance, considering it was a headwind in 2024? A: DLocal assumes general steady FX rates from where the last year ended, without baking in too many assumptions around FX. If currency depreciation continues, it will be a headwind, but if trends hold up, it could be a tailwind. (Pedro Art, CEO)

Q: Can you explain the cash decrease in the quarter and the changes in settlement with merchants? A: The cash decrease was due to temporary settlement delays and changes in settlement periods with merchants. There were large volumes at the end of the year, causing delays in funds, which have since been received. Additionally, a new orchestration model in Brazil shortened settlement periods, affecting working capital. (Mark Reitz, CFO)

Q: What are the expectations for gross profit growth, considering the strong ramp-up in the second half of 2024? A: The guidance reflects robust TPV growth and revenue growth, with a focus on sustaining high TPV growth despite take rate compression. The growth is driven by merchants hitting higher tiers and the ramp-up of new products, with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to grow faster than gross profit.

DLocal (DLO) Q4 Earnings Match Estimates,"DLocal (DLO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this online payment company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.15, delivering a surprise of 66.67%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

DLocal , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $204.49 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.56%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $188.01 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

DLocal shares have added about 24.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.3%.

What's Next for DLocal?

While DLocal has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for DLocal: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.13 on $208.2 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.59 on $939.42 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.",2025-02-27 23:15:10,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dlocal-dlo-q4-earnings-match-231510089.html,Yahoo Finance
"Fintech dLocal posts below-forecast net profit, shares tumble after hours","By Sarah Morland

(Reuters) -Uruguayan fintech dLocal on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter net profit up 4% but well below analysts' estimates, causing the shares to tumble in after-hours trading.

Profits were up 4% from a year earlier to $29.7 million, thanks partly to stronger payment volumes in Egypt, but still well below the $44.7 million estimate of analysts polled by LSEG.

Revenues for the payments provider, which operates across some 42 markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America, landed at $204.5 million, up 9% and broadly in line with the $206 million forecast.

Shares sank close to 18% in after-hours trading following the publication.

While results rose less than anticipated by analysts, its 2024 total payments volume landed well within dLocal's own target range issued in August last year.

The company said the results showed progress in an investment cycle that aims to continue scaling up the business.

""We have been in a phase where top-line growth has been outpacing bottom-line growth by design,"" CEO Pedro Arnst told Reuters in an interview, saying the company was focusing on investing in expanding its presence in existing markets.

He said the company plans to keep spending at a similar pace as previous years, investing in product and technology, innovation and research, licensing and regulatory compliance.

The firm had no plans to expand into new markets though it would consider this at the request of a major client, he added.

For 2025, the company predicted a total payments volume - the sum of its transactions - up 35% to 45%, bringing revenues up some 25% to 35% and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) up 20% to 30%.

Regarding the threat of U.S. tariffs across many regions and markets, Arnst said more complex trade routes between the United States, China and the European Union could potentially boost dLocal by prompting firms there to turn to emerging markets.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a note they considered dLocal's guidance conservative, and despite the profit miss continued to have a positive outlook for the firm going into 2025.

DLocal launched in 2016 and quickly became Uruguay's first unicorn, or a private start-up valued at over $1 billion. Five years later, it listed in New York at a value of some $9.5 billion, though this has since dipped to around $4 billion.

What Makes DLocal (DLO) a New Buy Stock,"DLocal (DLO) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.

Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for DLocal basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.

Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for DLocal imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

"Wingstop initiated, CarMax upgraded: Wall Street’s top analyst calls","The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today’s research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.

Top 5 Upgrades:

Stephens upgraded CarMax (KMX) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $90, up from $86, ahead of the company’s Q4 report due on April 10. The firm cites valuation now being in-line with long-term averages, and an analysis of both real-time unit sales and credit metrics that give it comfort in its calendar 2025 estimates.

BofA double upgraded Playtika (PLTK) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $6.50, up from $6. Given an all-time high next twelve months free cash flow yield of 21% and a dividend yield of 9%, the firm thinks downside to the shares is limited and believes a “share price dislocation” has been driven by the exit of a large shareholder in a low trading liquidity, concerns that Playtika’s transition to growth has taken too long and investor preference for mobile ad networks assets over publishers.

Morgan Stanley upgraded Global-e Online (GLBE) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $46, down from $55. The firm believes investor expectations have moderated to a more reasonable level, and it likes Global-e Online’s “achievable” growth targets and “cheap optionality” in Borderfree.com.

Morgan Stanley upgraded Range Resources (RRC) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $49, up from $40.

J.B. Hunt keeps its 11-year-old debt rating from Moody’s,"J.B. Hunt has had the same debt rating for more than 10 years and it didn't change in a recent review. (Photo: Jim Allen\FreightWaves)

About 11 years after Moody’s first placed a Baa1 rating on J.B. Hunt’s publicly traded debt, the ratings agency this week affirmed that rating.

It’s been a remarkable run of stability for the trucking and intermodal giant (NASDAQ: JBHT). The Baa1 rating – three notches above the dividing line between investment-grade and non-investment-grade debt – dates back to 2014.

Baa1 is equivalent to the BBB rating of S&P Global Ratings. S&P has had a BBB rating on J.B. Hunt since 2012, though last summer it changed the outlook on the company to “stable” from “positive.”

Moody’s already had a stable outlook on J.B. Hunt, and it retained that outlook in the affirmation of the Baa1 rating. A stable outlook at both ratings agencies means conditions are not likely to result in an upgrade or downgrade of the company anytime in the near future.

Moody’s undertook the review of J.B. Hunt’s debt because the Arkansas-based company is issuing $500 million in senior unsecured debt to replace an existing $500 million term loan that is due in September. Moody’s said that loan is not rated.

Unlike privately held companies with publicly traded debt, the reports of rating agencies on a publicly traded company like J.B. Hunt do not offer as many insights into a company’s fiscal situation. Earnings are released every quarter, and equity markets provide a verdict on their view of the company every day.

Ironically, J.B. Hunt, along with numerous other trucking companies, hit a 52-week low in equity trading Wednesday, reaching $151.60. It is down about 23.8% for the year and 6.8% in the past month.

“The affirmation of J.B. Hunt’s existing rating and maintenance of the stable outlook reflects the company’s favorable credit metrics, with leverage expected to remain around 1.0x and positive free cash flow, despite an ongoing slowdown in the freight sector,” Moody’s wrote in its rating report. “J.B. Hunt also benefits from its position as a leading surface transportation and logistics company with a strong national footprint and intermodal franchise arrangements with most of the major North American railroads.”",2025-03-12 19:59:16,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-b-hunt-keeps-11-195916808.html,Yahoo Finance
"J. B. Hunt Hurt by Segmental Weakness, Higher Interest Expenses","J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. JBHT is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which, we believe, have made it an unimpressive investment option.

Let’s delve deeper.

J.B. Hunt's top line continues to grapple with weakness across the majority of its business segments. The total fourth-quarter 2024 operating revenues were $3.15 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13 billion but declined 4.8% year over year. Total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, decreased 2% year over year. The downside was owing to a 3% and 2% decline in revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenues, in intermodal and Truckload, respectively, a 4% decline in average trucks in Dedicated Contract Services, and a 22% decline in load volume in Integrated Capacity Solutions.

Higher net interest expenses are likely to mar J.B. Hunt’s bottom line. JBHT continues to incur higher interest expenses owing to higher interest rates and debt issuance costs. Net interest expense for 2024 increased 23.9% year over year due to higher effective interest rates and consolidated debt balance, partially offset by higher interest income.

J.B. Hunt’s weak cash position is worrisome. JBHT's cash and cash equivalents stood at $46.98 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, much lower than the short-term debt of $500 million. This implies that the company does not have sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations.

Driver shortage continues to be a major challenge facing the trucking industry. As old drivers retire, trucking companies find it difficult to hire drivers since the job does not appeal to the younger generation.

Partly due to these headwinds, shares of JBHT have plunged 22% over the past year compared with the transportation-truck industry’s decline of 35.7%.

Southward Earnings Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved 23.1% south in the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has been revised to 14.5% downward in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.

Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: JBHT currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company’s current Value Score of C shows its unattractiveness.

Unimpressive Earnings Surprise History: JBHT has a discouraging earnings surprise history, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (surpassed the same in the remaining quarter).

Insider Ownership Of J.B. Hunt Transport Services

For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. J.B. Hunt Transport Services insiders own about US$3.4b worth of shares (which is 21% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",2025-03-10 11:14:13,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-stock-buying-reaches-us-111413099.html,Yahoo Finance

"Jim Cramer on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT): ‘A Barometer of Business’","We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Last Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, questioned whether the market was still following a clear and predictable business cycle, suggesting there were “huge conflicting currents” that made the economy difficult to navigate. Reflecting on his early days in the industry, Cramer explained that back then, understanding the business cycle was important.

READ ALSO Jim Cramer Suggested Buying These 8 Stocks on Weakness and Jim Cramer Talked About These 12 Stocks Recently

“If business was too strong, the Fed might raise rates, pull things off. If business was too weak, you might have some rate cuts. You always had to pay attention to these things, right, because you didn’t wanna fight the Fed.”

But on that particular day, with the Dow gaining 71 points, the S&P advancing by 0.24% to reach a new all-time record, and the Nasdaq edging up by 0.07%, Cramer began to reconsider whether the traditional concept of the business cycle had become outdated.

Cramer went on to highlight the puzzling movements in specific sectors, especially food and beverage and drug stocks, which showed some unexpected gains. These industries, often seen as immune to economic cycles, seemed to defy the typical patterns.

He pointed out that in light of the current administration’s stance on food policy, especially with a health and human services secretary who has expressed disdain for processed foods and vaccinations, it was not just a cycle affecting these sectors anymore, it felt more like a targeted attack on the industries themselves. Cramer wondered, “What if RFK Jr. wakes up tomorrow and says, ‘I’m banning Fruit Loops’ or stopping weight loss shots?”

“I mean, everyone in this administration seems to think that the federal government could do whatever it wants. That’s not, that’s not how our system works or at least it’s not how the Constitution says it works, but the blight’s very much with us, even with today’s reprieve.”

Here's Why Investors Should Give J.B. Hunt Stock a Miss Now,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.JBHT is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which, we believe, have made it an unimpressive investment option.

Let’s delve deeper.

JBHT: Key Risks to Watch

Southward Earnings Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved 23.1% south in the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has been revised to 14.5% downward in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.

Dim Price Performance: The company’s price trend reveals that its shares have plunged 16.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s 25.6% loss.

Zacks Investment Research



Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: JBHT currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company’s current Value Score of C shows its unattractiveness.

Unimpressive Earnings Surprise History: JBHT has a discouraging earnings surprise history, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (surpassed the same in the remaining quarter). The average miss is 8.37%.

Bearish Industry Rank: The industry to which JBHT belongs currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 200 (out of 250). Such an unfavorable rank places it in the bottom 19% of Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to.

A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Reckoning the industry’s performance becomes imperative.

Headwinds: J.B. Hunt's top line continues to grapple with weakness across the majority of its business segments. Higher net interest expense (owing to higher interest rates and debt issuance cost) is likely to mar J.B. Hunt’s bottom line. The company’s weak cash position is worrisome. JBHT's cash and cash equivalents stood at $46.98 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, much lower than the short-term debt of $500 million. This implies that the company does not have sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations.

The truck industry, of which JBHT is an integral part, has been persistently battling a driver shortage for several years. As old drivers retire, trucking companies are finding it difficult to find new drivers to take their place since the low-esteem job mostly does not appeal to the younger generation.

"Could The Market Be Wrong About J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?","It is hard to get excited after looking at J.B. Hunt Transport Services' (NASDAQ:JBHT) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.8% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on J.B. Hunt Transport Services' ROE.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

View our latest analysis for J.B. Hunt Transport Services

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for J.B. Hunt Transport Services is:

14% = US$571m ÷ US$4.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

J.B. Hunt Transport Services' Earnings Growth And 14% ROE

To start with, J.B. Hunt Transport Services' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. This certainly adds some context to J.B. Hunt Transport Services' moderate 6.0% net income growth seen over the past five years.

We then compared J.B. Hunt Transport Services' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.

NasdaqGS:JBHT Past Earnings Growth February 20th 2025

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for JBHT?

"J.B. Hunt working on intermodal mix, awaiting rate inflection","J.B. Hunt discusses three-pronged approach to intermodal bid season. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)

J.B. Hunt Transport Services said it’s focused on finding the right intermodal freight to improve efficiency and minimize costs as market fundamentals remain tepid.

The Lowell, Arkansas-based multimodal transportation provider outlined a three-pronged approach centered on rates, volumes and freight mix for the current intermodal bid season at Barclays 42nd Annual Industrial Select Conference held in Miami on Wednesday.

While rate increases are the most impactful lever the company has to drive margins higher, it may have to settle for improving mix as there is no guarantee pricing will move up materially this year with capacity readily available.

J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) said it’s focused on winning the right freight that allows it to run a balanced network with minimal empty containers and repositioning costs. It views freight selection as the primary “controllable” at this point of the cycle.

“It might not necessarily do a lot to revenue per load or rate or yield, but it can do a lot in terms of making us more efficient and productive with our assets and with utilization,” said Brad Delco, senior vice president of finance.

The unit saw record volumes for a second straight time during the fourth quarter, but the operating ratio (inverse of operating margin) deteriorated 170 basis points year over year to 92.7%. Equipment repositioning costs from network imbalances and peak season hiring expenses were the culprits, along with a decline in revenue per load.

J.B. Hunt’s long-term operating margin target for intermodal is 10% to 12% (90% to 88% OR). Part of the recent overhang on the business is the company’s decision to grow capacity ahead of demand. J.B. Hunt has been carrying incremental costs tied to equipment acquisitions but believes the gamble on capacity will pay off over time. It estimates there are 7 million to 11 million loads that should be moved off the highway and onto the railroads.

On the current demand front, management said it’s “still a little too early” to say what intermodal rates will do this year. It said more will be known in May and June but also noted that March is an important month. Importantly, it said the recent volume surge is not from customers pulling forward inventory due to tariff concerns as some analysts have suggested. It also said some customers have indicated they will be converting truck shipments to the rails this year as one-way truckload rates rise.

The multinational company is also selling its airport logistics business to Toyota Industries subsidiary Vanderlande and is looking to divest most of its wind business in India and Sri Lanka.
